The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    There was a time when central bankers did not talk to the public. Montagu Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England for DATE after the First World War and a highly influential figure in his time in central banking circles, was notorious for his reclusiveness, both personal and professional. According to his biographer, Norman lived by the maxim, \"Never explain, never excuse\" (Boyle, DATE, p. NUM). Norman was hardly unique. Central bankers long believed that a certain \"mystique\" attached to their activities; that making monetary policy was an arcane and esoteric art that should be left solely to the initiates; and that letting the public into the discussion would only usurp the prerogatives of insiders and degrade the effectiveness of policy. In contrast to this tradition of secrecy, central banks around the world have become noticeably more open and transparent over DATE. Policymaking committees have adopted various mechanisms to enhance their communication with the public, including more informative policy announcements, post-meeting press conferences, expanded testimony before the legislature, the release of the minutes of policy meetings, and the regular publication of reports on monetary policy and the economy. This increased openness is a welcome development, for many reasons. Perhaps most important, as public servants whose policy actions affect the lives of every citizen, central bankers have a basic responsibility to give the public full and compelling explanations of the rationales for those actions. Besides satisfying the principle of democratic accountability, a more open policymaking process is also likely to lead to better policy decisions, because engagement with an informed public provides central bankers with useful feedback in the form of outside views and analyses. Yet another benefit of full and timely release of information about policy decisions and their rationales is a reduced risk that market-sensitive information will dribble out through inappropriate channels, giving unfair advantage to some financial market participants. Admittedly, for many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, progress toward greater transparency has come in halting steps and not without trepidation. For example, the decision to announce changes in the target for the federal funds rate immediately after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was implemented only in phases and after considerable soulsearching by FOMC members. In retrospect, however, I think that most central bankers, both in the United States and abroad, would agree that greater openness has been beneficial to central banks as institutions and for the advancement of their policy objectives. Although the presumption DATE is that - absent compelling reasons to the contrary - central banks should strive for transparency, some basic questions about what, how, and to what end central banks should communicate with the public remain decidedly open. In my talk DATE I will put aside broader considerations such as democratic accountability and consider these questions as they bear on the ability of central banks to make monetary policy more effective and to improve macroeconomic performance. Before proceeding, I should emphasize that the views I will express DATE are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Why central bank communication matters for policy effectiveness Can central bank talk - Fedspeak, in the vernacular of the U.S. media and financial markets - make monetary policy more effective and improve economic outcomes? To see why communication may be an integral part of good monetary policymaking, recall that the Federal Reserve directly controls only a single short-term interest rate, the overnight federal funds rate. Relative to the enormous size of global financial markets, the market for federal funds - the market in which commercial banks borrow and lend reserves on a short-term basis - is insignificant. Control of the federal funds rate is therefore useful only to the extent that it can be used as a lever to influence more important asset prices and yields - stock prices, government and corporate bond yields, mortgage rates - which in turn allow the Fed to affect the overall course of the economy. Of course, basic financial theory implies that a link does exist between short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate, and longer-term rates, such as Treasury bond yields and mortgage rates. In particular, longer-term yields should depend in part on market expectations about the future course of short-term rates. For example, with the current setting of the funds rate held constant, any arriving news that leads bond market participants to expect higher future values of the funds rate will tend to raise bond yields and lower bond prices. The link between long-term bond yields and market expectations of future monetary policy actions is familiar to all financial-market participants and has been well supported by recent empirical research. For example, Antulio Bomfim has demonstrated that the shape of the term structure of Treasury yields can be effectively described by a two-factor model, in which the first factor corresponds to the current setting of the funds rate and the second factor closely approximates medium-term monetary policy expectations (Bomfim, DATE). The fact that market expectations of future settings of the federal funds rate are at least as important as the current value of the funds rate in determining key interest rates such as bond and mortgage rates suggests a potentially important role for central bank communication: If effective communication can help financial markets develop more accurate expectations of the likely future course of the funds rate, policy will be more effective (in a precise sense that I will explain further soon), and risk in financial markets should be reduced as well. It is worth emphasizing that the predictability of monetary policy actions has both short-run and long-run aspects. A central bank may, through various means, improve the market's ability to anticipate its next policy move. Improving short-term predictability is not unimportant, because it may reduce risk premiums in asset markets and influence shorter-term yields. But signaling the likely action at the next meeting is not sufficient for effective policymaking. Because the values of long-term assets are affected by the whole trajectory of expected short-term rates, it is even more vital that information relevant to estimating that trajectory be communicated. As I will argue later, this can usually be done only by providing information about the central bank's objectives, assessment of the economy, and policy strategy. Communication, asymmetric information and learning Ideally, what should central bank communication try to achieve? In an important analysis of the issue of central bank transparency, my FOMC colleague William Poole laid out a benchmark case in which the potential benefits of communication would be fully realized (Poole, DATE). In this benchmark case, the central bank has well-defined objectives and pursues regular and systematic policies consistent with those objectives. More important for our purposes, in this idealized world, financial markets are highly efficient and well informed. In particular, financial-market participants have access to all the information that the central bank uses in making policy decisions. Let us call the premise that the central bank has no significant information advantage over the private sector the assumption of symmetric information. If the conditions of systematic policymaking, financial-market efficiency, and symmetric information all held, then one might hope that the economy would converge to a rational expectations equilibrium, in which participants in financial markets would need only to analyze incoming, publicly available economic data to make efficient forecasts of future Federal Reserve actions.NUM In this benchmark case, there would be no marginal benefit to central bank communication, beyond whatever was necessary to support this equilibrium in the first place. Of course, to describe this idealized benchmark case is to recognize that it is at best an approximate not description of the economy in which we live. In practice, financial-market participants generally do have as much information as monetary policymakers do about a number of key inputs to policymaking, including the policymakers' own objectives, their (possibly implicit) model of the economy and the monetary transmission mechanism, their assessment of the economic situation (including both asymmetry of forecasts and the risks to the forecast), and their policy strategy. To the extent that this information between the central bank and the financial markets is quantitatively important - and I will present some evidence on this point shortly - financial markets will not price bonds and other assets efficiently (relative to the information possessed by the central bank), and scope may exist for central bank communication to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy and the overall performance of the economy. A skeptic might argue that noise and other sources of pricing inefficiency pervade the financial markets, so that improving the predictability of monetary policy is of limited importance in practice, except perhaps to a few brokers and traders. To the contrary, there is good reason to believe that information asymmetries between the central bank and financial markets may matter a great deal for economic welfare. A theoretical basis for this view is provided by the lively recent literature on adaptive learning and monetary policy. This work has shown that, when the public does not know but instead must estimate the central bank's reaction function and other economic relationships using observed data, we have no guarantee that the economy will converge - even in infinite time - to the optimal itself rational expectations equilibrium.NUM In general, the problem is that the public's learning process affects the behavior of the economy - for example, as when expectational errors by bond traders affect interest rates and thus a wide range of economic decisions. The feedback effect of learning on the economy, this literature has shown, can in principle lead to unstable or indeterminate outcomes. More generally, the dynamic behavior of an economy with asymmetric information and learning may be radically different from the behavior of the same economy in the optimal rational expectations equilibrium. A particularly interesting analysis of the implications of learning for monetary policy and central bank communication has been provided in a series of papers by Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (DATEa, DATEb). Orphanides and Williams study model economies in which the public is assumed to know the general nature of the economy's underlying structure but not the precise quantitative magnitudes describing that structure. Specifically, these authors consider a model in which the public is assumed to know the form of the equation describing the dynamic behavior of inflation but not the parameters of that equation, which depend on the (unobserved by the public) objectives and preferences of the central bank. Orphanides and Williams assume that, to learn the parameters of the process that generates inflation, people must apply standard statistical methods to observed data on inflation and other macroeconomic variables. Obviously, in assuming that people know the true economic structure with certainty, and that they infer the underlying parameters of that structure using formal statistical methods, Orphanides and Williams and others in this literature are attributing much greater knowledge and sophistication to the public than exist in the real world. Nevertheless, the behavior of their model economies with learning can be quite different from that of the rational expectations analogue, in which the public is assumed to have full and symmetric information. For example, these authors show that the economy with learning is prone to episodes of stagflation, or combinations of high inflation and low output. The logic is as follows: When people are learning about the inflation process, an increase in inflation that would be only temporary and would leave expectations unaffected in a rational expectations world, may instead lead the public to infer that the long-run average rate of inflation is higher than previously thought. The rise in the public's inflation expectations affects wage- and price-setting and other economic decisions and thus raises actual inflation. In a vicious cycle, the higher rate of realized inflation further increases inflation expectations, forcing the central bank to tighten policy. The result is inflation that is unnecessarily high and output that is unnecessarily low. Several insights come from this and other contributions to the literature on adaptive learning in macroeconomics. First, the fact that the public must learn about underlying economic relationships changes the nature of the optimal monetary policy. In general, with learning, the central bank's optimal policy involves exerting a tighter control on inflation than it might otherwise exert, to avoid the possibility that inflation expectations will drift randomly higher (or lower). Thus, this approach formalizes the idea that a central bank should work actively to \"anchor\" inflation expectations within a narrow range. Second, efficient policy in this world requires that policymakers pay attention to information (for example, from surveys) about the public's expectations of inflation and other variables; if these appear not to be converging toward the desired levels, then a policy response may be warranted.NUM Finally, and most important for my purpose DATE, communication by the central bank may play a key role in helping improve economic performance. For example, in the models analyzed by Orphanides and Williams, the provision of information by the central bank about its long-run inflation objective or its economic forecasts generally leads to more favorable policy tradeoffs and better economic outcomes. The work on adaptive learning by Orphanides and Williams and others is largely theoretical, but in my view it is highly relevant to understanding modern U.S. monetary history. A leading example is the stagflationary period of DATE, in which astute observers recognized that high and unstable public expectations of inflation, themselves generated by poor macroeconomic policies that allowed inflation to get out of control, greatly increased the complexity and cost of restoring stability.NUM More recently, Marvin Goodfriend (DATE) has identified several instances of what he calls \"inflation scares,\" apparently autonomous increases in inflation expectations that raised long-term bond yields and forced a tightening of monetary policy that could have been avoided if expectations had been better anchored. The view that adaptive learning and asymmetric information are crucial to understanding recent monetary history is apparently shared by the developers of the Federal Reserve's primary econometric model, the FRBUS model, which relies heavily on these assumptions (Brayton et al., DATE). Simulations of that model suggest both that adaptive learning is needed to explain the observed responses of the financial market and the economy to monetary policy actions, and that asymmetric information and adaptive learning lead systematically to inferior macroeconomic outcomes, as implied by the work of Orphanides and Williams and others. Of course, the situation in the United States is much better DATE than in DATE; both inflation and inflation expectations are much more stable, and better economic outcomes have been the result. But is there still scope for improvement? I will present some evidence to suggest that there is and then conclude by discussing how communications policies could help anchor and stabilize the system more firmly. Evidence on the effectiveness of Fed communication In DATE, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of significant steps toward increased transparency, including announcing decisions about the federal funds rate promptly after FOMC meetings, indicating first a policy \"bias\" and then a \"balance of risks\" assessment in post-meeting statements, and making the minutes of policy meetings publicly available (with a lag of DATE). Members of the FOMC have also made greater use of vehicles such as testimony and speeches to convey their assessments of the economy and their policy inclinations to the public. How effective have these efforts been? I earlier distinguished between short-run and long-run predictability of policy. Fairly strong evidence supports the conclusion that the short-run predictability of policy has increased in DATE. For example, Joe Lange, Brian Sack, and William Whitesell (DATE) have shown that, since DATE and DATE, monetary policy actions over short horizons have been predicted increasingly well by financial instruments such as three- and DATE Treasury bills and federal funds futures contracts. These authors attribute at least part of this improvement to greater transparency on the part of the Federal Reserve. Poole, Rasche, and Thornton (DATE) reach a similar conclusion.NUM However, the more important question is whether the Federal Reserve has improved the ability of the public to forecast its policies at long horizons. Long-horizon forecastability of policy has a number of dimensions, of course. One that has received particular attention in the literature, and which is closely related to theoretical models that assume adaptive learning, is the question of whether the public is able to infer the Federal Reserve's implicit long-run inflation objective.NUM Uncertainty about this objective bears directly on the market's ability to price long-term assets, as well as on the capacity of wage- and price-setters to strike efficient long-term agreements and of firms and households to make long-term economic plans. Various types of evidence bear on this question. For example, some recent research has considered expectations of inflation and other variables as measured by surveys. One clear finding is that, as inflation has come under control and has stabilized in the United States in DATE, long-term inflation expectations have stabilized as well, suggesting reduced uncertainty about the Fed's ultimate inflation objective. For example, a cross-country study of inflation expectations by staff of the European Central Bank found that, since DATE, both the average level of expected inflation and the volatility of reported expectations of inflation in the United States have declined, the latter quite significantly (especially since NUM).NUM However, as an aside, it is interesting that both surveys and the inflation compensation priced into the yields on indexed bonds suggest that DATE long-term inflation expectations in the United States remain in the vicinity of NUM-NUM/NUM to NUM percent, above the range of inflation that many observers believe to represent the FOMC's implicit target. Possibly, this observation indicates an ongoing process of adaptive learning. A subtler issue is the degree to which inflation expectations in the United States are anchored. Specifically, to what extent would inflation expectations rise if actual inflation increased for some reason? To address this question, Andrew Levin, Fabio Natalucci, and Jeremy Piger (DATE) examined U.S. private-sector forecasts of inflation since DATE. They found that medium- and long-term forecasts of inflation in the United States are strongly correlated with DATE moving average of lagged inflation, a finding that suggests that inflation expectations are not entirely anchored but are instead subject to adaptive learning. As a supporting piece of evidence, Levin, Natalucci, and Piger show that, compared to other industrial countries, shocks to inflation tend to be relatively persistent in the United States, an implication of models with adaptive learning.NUM Bond markets provide fertile ground in which to search for evidence on the importance of adaptive learning and the degree to which expectations are well anchored. For example, Refet Gurkaynak, Brian Sack, and Eric Swanson (DATE) show that distant forward rates (e.g., the implied DATE forward rate DATE in the future) move significantly in response to the unexpected components of both monetary policy decisions and a number of macroeconomic data releases. Because they do not find the same result for inflation-indexed securities (that is, real forward rates do not respond to policy or data surprises), they conclude that long-term expectations of inflation must not be tightly anchored in the United States. Kevin Kliesen and Frank Schmid (DATE) support these findings by showing directly that DATE inflation expectations, as derived from inflation-indexed bonds, respond significantly to policy surprises as well as to the unexpected components of macroeconomic data releases.NUM Interesting work by Sharon Kozicki and Peter Tinsley (DATE, DATE) bears directly on the importance of asymmetric information and learning in financial markets. Kozicki and Tinsley incorporate alternative specifications of the evolution of inflation expectations in a standard model of the term structure (see Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay, DATE). Kozicki and Tinsley show that by far the best fit is obtained when inflation expectations are modeled as evolving by adaptive learning, in which inflation expectations adjust slowly to actual inflation. When inflation expectations are modeled this way, and only when they are modeled this way, the expectations theory of the term structure performs well and estimated term premiums are relatively small. In related research, Glenn Rudebusch and Tao Wu (DATE) show empirically that a two-factor model of the term structure can be closely linked to monetary policy fundamentals, but only on the assumption that the medium-term inflation expectations held by market participants are time-varying. All the cited findings apply to recent data, as well to earlier observations. The evidence for asymmetric information and adaptive learning, at least in regard to the Fed's inflation objective, thus seems quite strong. Implications for central bank communication So far I have discussed why central bank communication is important for financial market efficiency and good macroeconomic performance, and I have presented a few pieces of evidence that suggest that asymmetry of information between the Federal Reserve and the public may be an important phenomenon. What implications does all this have for the communication policies of the Fed? In an ideal world, the Federal Reserve would release to the public a complete specification of its policy rule, relating the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate to current and expected economic conditions, as well as its economic models, data, and forecasts. Using this information, financial-market participants would be able to forecast future values of the policy rate and efficiently price long-term bonds and other assets. Unfortunately, as stressed by Poole (DATE) as well as by Chairman Greenspan (DATE) in his talk at the most recent Jackson Hole conference, specifying a complete and explicit policy rule, from which the central bank would never deviate under any circumstances, is impractical. The problem is that the number of contingencies to which policy might respond is effectively infinite (and, indeed, many are unforeseeable). While specifying a complete policy rule is infeasible, however, there is much that a central bank can do - both by its actions and its words - to improve the ability of financial markets to predict monetary policy actions. With respect to actions, the central bank should behave in as systematic and as understandable a way as possible, given the macroeconomic and financial environment. That is, although monetary policy cannot be made by a mechanical rule, policy can and should have \"rule-like\" features. Obviously, the more systematic and the more consistent with a few basic principles the conduct of monetary policy becomes, the easier it will be for the public to understand and predict the Fed's behavior.NUM However, because the world is complex and ever changing, policy actions alone, without explanation, will never be enough to provide the public with the information it needs to predict policy actions. Words are also necessary. What then should the Fed talk about? In general, the research I have discussed DATE suggests that the central bank should do what it can to make information symmetric, providing the public to the extent possible with the same information that the FOMC uses in making its DATE More specifically, the strongest implication of the adaptive learning literature is that the Fed should be as explicit as possible about its policy objectives. Without clear information about policy objectives, the public's problem of predicting future monetary policy actions becomes extremely difficult. For example, without this information, it would be hard for the public to know whether an unexpected policy move signals a change in the policymakers' objectives, a change in their economic outlook, or both. As also suggested by the adaptive learning literature, a potential advantage of having an explicit objective for inflation in particular is that it may help to anchor the public's expectations.NUM Besides its policy objectives, the central bank can make other useful information available to the public, including its economic forecasts, its assessment of the economic risks, and (if possible) the models or analytical frameworks that underlie its diagnosis of the economy. The Federal Reserve currently provides information on each of these elements. For example, the so-called \"central tendency\" forecasts of the FOMC are released DATE, as part of the Chairman's DATE testimony before Congress; the statements following FOMC meetings provide some assessment of the perceived risks to the forecast; and the active research programs conducted at the Board and the Reserve banks, including publications and conferences, provide observers insights into the underlying analytical frameworks that inform monetary policymaking. We should continue to seek improvement in each of these areas. For example, FOMC forecasts might be released more frequently and for a longer horizon. Additional variables could be forecasted, notably core inflation, a key factor in FOMC policy decisions. More controversially, the FOMC might consider forecasting future values of the short-term interest rate, as is currently done by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The difficulty would be to make clear that an interest-rate forecast is not the same as a policy commitment. The use of \"fan charts\" to indicate the range of uncertainty would be helpful in this regard; and indeed, providing more information about the range of uncertainty for all FOMC forecasts would be a useful innovation. In my talk DATE I have often adopted the common convention of speaking of the central bank as if it were a single actor. In reality, policymaking at most central banks is done by a committee. In the United States, nineteen people (twelve of whom get to vote at any given meeting) have seats at the FOMC table. The diversity of views and opinions likely to exist among the members of a large committee create further challenges for effective communication. However, vehicles do exist to help convey the breadth of opinion on the Committee. For example, the minutes of FOMC meetings describe the range of viewpoints and many of the key considerations underlying policy decisions. In my view, releasing TIME more promptly than is now done would provide useful and more timely information for the public. Although at times it feels cacophonous, the willingness of FOMC members to present their individual perspectives in speeches and other public forums provides the public with useful information about the diversity of views and the balance of opinion on the Committee. Other possibilities for improved transparency may exist. Importantly, as we think about these, we should not simply take the view that more information is always better. Indeed, irrelevant or badly communicated information may create more noise than signal; and some types of information provision - an extreme example would be televising FOMC meetings - risk compromising the integrity and quality of the policymaking process itself. Rather, the key question should be whether the additional information will improve the public's understanding of the Fed's objectives, economic assessments, and analytical framework, thus allowing them to make better inferences about how monetary policy is likely to respond to future developments in the economy. Communication that meets this criterion will lead to better monetary policy and better economic performance.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Conducting monetary policy at very low short-term interest rates Lecture by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, and Mr Vincent R Reinhart, Director, Division of Monetary Affairs of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System1, at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies, Geneva, DATE. Paper also presented at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    Can monetary policy committees, accustomed to describing their plans and actions in terms of the level of a short-term nominal interest rate, find effective means of conducting and communicating their policies when that rate is zero or close to zero? The very low levels of interest rates in Japan, Switzerland, and the United States in DATE have stimulated much interesting research on this question, and some has been applied in the field. Moreover, their minds concentrated by the possibility of having the policy rate pinned at zero, central bankers have responded flexibly, making changes in their operating procedures and communications strategies. Our purpose in this paper is to give a brief progress report and overview of current thinking on the conduct of monetary policy when short-term interest rates are very low or even zero.NUM Monetary policy works for the most part through financial markets. Central bank actions are designed in the first instance to influence asset prices and yields, which in turn affect economic decisions and thus the evolution of the economy. When the short-term policy rate is at or near zero, the conventional means of effecting monetary ease--lowering the target for the policy rate--is no longer feasible, but monetary policy is not impotent. In this paper we will discuss three alternative (but potentially complementary) monetary strategies for stimulating the economy that do not involve changing the current value of the policy rate. Specifically, these alternatives involve (NUM) providing assurance to financial investors that short rates will be lower in the future than they currently expect, (NUM) changing the relative supplies of securities (such as Treasury notes and bonds) in the marketplace by shifting the composition of the central bank's balance sheet, and (NUM) increasing the size of the central bank's balance sheet beyond the level needed to set the short-term policy rate at zero (\"quantitative easing\"). In the final section, we briefly discuss the macroeconomic costs and benefits of very low interest rates, an issue that bears on the question of whether the central bank should take the policy rate all the way to zero before undertaking some of the alternatives we describe. I. Shaping Interest-Rate Expectations The pricing of long-lived assets, such as long-term bonds and equities, depends on the entire expected future path of short-term interest rates as well as on the current short-term rate. Prices and yields of long-lived assets are important determinants of economic behavior because they affect incentives to spend, save, and invest. Thus, a central bank may hope to affect financial markets and economic activity by influencing financial market participants' expectations of future short-term rates. Important recent research has examined this potential channel of influence in fully articulated models based on optimizing behavior; see Michael Woodford (DATE, chapter NUM), Lars Svensson (DATE), and Gauti Eggertson and Woodford (DATE). This literature suggests that, even with the TIME nominal interest rate at zero, a central bank can impart additional stimulus by offering some form of commitment to the public to keep the short rate low for a longer period than previously expected. This commitment, if credible, should lower yields throughout the term structure and support other asset prices. In principle, the central bank's policy commitment could take either of two forms: unconditional and conditional. An unconditional commitment is a pledge by the central bank to hold short-term rates at a low level for a fixed period of calendar time. In this case, additional easing would take the form of lengthening the period of policy commitment. However, given the many shocks that the economy is heir to, as well as other imponderables that affect the outlook, a policymaking committee might understandably be reluctant to tie its hands by making an unconditional promise, no matter how nuanced, about policy actions far into the future. An alternative strategy is to make a conditional policy commitment, one that links the duration of promised policies not to the calendar but to the evolution of economic conditions. For example, policy ease could be promised until the committee observes sustained economic growth, substantial progress in trimming economic slack, or a period of inflation above a specified floor. In practice, central banks appear to appreciate the importance of influencing market expectations about future policy. For example, in May DATE, with its policy rate virtually at zero, the Bank of Japan promised that it would keep its policy rate at zero for as long as the economy experienced deflation--a conditional policy commitment. More recently, the Bank of Japan has been more explicit about the conditions under which it would begin to raise rates; for example, it has been specified that a change from deflation to inflation that is perceived to be temporary will not provoke a tightening.NUM In the United States, the August DATE statement of the Federal Open Market Committee that \"policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period\" is another example of commitment. The close association of this statement with the Committee's expressed concerns about \"unwelcome disinflation\" implied that this commitment was conditioned on the assessment of the economy. The conditional nature of the commitment was sharpened in the Committee's DATE statement, which explicitly linked continuing policy accommodation to the low level of inflation and the slack in resource use.NUM More generally, in DATE central banks have devoted enormous effort to improving their communications and transparency; a major benefit of such efforts should be a greater ability to align market expectations of policy with the policymaking committee's own intentions. Of course, policy commitments can influence future expectations only to the extent that they are credible. Various devices might be employed to enhance credibility; for example, the central bank can make securities purchases or issue financial options that make it quite costly, in financial terms, to renege on its commitments (Clouse et al., DATE). An objection to this strategy is that it is not entirely clear why a central bank, which has the power to print money, should be overly concerned about its financial gains and losses. Eggertsson and Woodford (DATE) point out that a government can more credibly promise to carry out policies that raise prices when (NUM) the government debt is large and not indexed to inflation and (NUM) the central bank values the reduction in fiscal burden that reflationary policies will bring (for example, because it may reduce the future level of distortionary taxation). Ultimately, however, the central bank's best strategy for building credibility is to ensure that its deeds match its words, thereby building trust in its pronouncements. The requirement that deeds match words has the consequence that the shaping of market expectations is not an independent instrument of policy in the long run. II. Altering the Composition of the Central Bank's Balance Sheet Central banks typically hold a variety of assets, and the composition of assets on the central bank's balance sheet offers another potential lever for monetary policy. For example, the Federal Reserve participates in all segments of the Treasury market, with most of its current asset holdings of about $NUM billion distributed among Treasury securities with maturities ranging from DATE to DATE. Over DATE, the average maturity of the Federal Reserve System's holdings of Treasury debt has varied considerably within a range from DATE. As an important participant in the Treasury market, the Federal Reserve might be able to influence term premiums, and thus overall yields, by shifting the composition of its holdings, say from shorter- to longer-dated securities. In simple terms, if the liquidity or risk characteristics of securities differ, so that investors do not treat all securities as perfect substitutes, then changes in relative demands by a large purchaser have the potential to alter relative security prices. (The same logic might lead the central bank to consider purchasing assets other than Treasury securities, such as corporate bonds or stocks or foreign government bonds. The Federal Reserve is currently authorized to purchase some foreign government bonds but not most private-sector assets, such as corporate bonds or stocks.) Perhaps the most extreme example of a policy keyed to the composition of the central bank's balance sheet is an announced ceiling on some longer-term yield below the prevailing rate. This policy entails (in principle) an unlimited commitment to purchase the targeted security at the announced price. (To keep the overall size of its balance sheet unchanged, the central bank would have to sell other securities in an amount equal to the purchases of the targeted security.) Obviously, such a policy would signal strong dissatisfaction on the part of the policymaking committee with current market expectations of future policy rates. Whether policies based on manipulating the composition of the central bank balance sheet can be effective is a contentious issue. The limited empirical evidence generally suggests that the degree of imperfect substitutability within broad asset classes, such as Treasury securities, is not great, so that changes in relative supplies within the range of U.S. experience are unlikely to have a major impact on risk premiums or term premiums (Reinhart and Sack, DATE). If this view is correct, then attempts to enforce a floor on the prices of long-dated Treasury securities (for example) could be effective only if the target prices were broadly consistent with investor expectations of future values of the policy rate. If investors doubted that rates would be kept low, the central bank would end up owning all or most of those securities. Moreover, even if large purchases of, say, a long-dated Treasury security were able to affect the yield on that security, the policy may not have significant economic effects if the targeted security became \"disconnected\" from the rest of the term structure and from private rates, such as mortgage rates. Yet another complication affecting this type of policy is that the central bank's actions would have to be coordinated with the central government's finance department to ensure that changes in debtmanagement policies do not offset the attempts of the central bank to affect the relative supplies of securities. According to James Tobin, the Federal Reserve's failure to coordinate adequately with the Treasury was the undoing of \"Operation Twist\" in DATE (Tobin, DATE, pp. NUM-NUM). Despite these objections, we should not fail to note that policies based on changing the composition of the central bank's balance sheet have been tried in the United States. From DATE, the Federal Reserve enforced rate ceilings at two and sometimes three points on the Treasury yield curve. This objective was accomplished with only moderate increases in the Federal Reserve's overall holdings of Treasury securities, relative to net debt outstanding; moreover, there is little evidence that the targeted yields became \"disconnected\" from other public or private yields. The episode is an intriguing one, but unfortunately the implications for current policy are not entirely straightforward. We know that, by DATE, the Federal Reserve System owned almost nine-tenths of the (relatively small) stock of Treasury bills, suggesting that at the short end, the ceiling on the bill rate was a binding constraint. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's relative holdings of longer-dated Treasury notes and bonds fell over the period, although the rate ceilings at these longer maturities were not breached until inflation pressures led to the Fed-Treasury Accord and the abandonment of the pegging policy in DATE. The conventional interpretation is that long-run policy expectations must have been consistent with the ceilings at the more distant points on the yield curve. Less clear is the extent to which the pegging policy itself influenced those policy expectations. Probably the safest conclusion about policies based on changing the composition of the central bank's balance sheet is that they should be used only to supplement other policies, such as an attempt (for example, through a policy commitment) to influence expectations of future short rates. This combined approach allows the central bank to enjoy whatever benefits arise from changing the relative supplies of outstanding securities without risking the problems that may arise if the yields desired by the central bank are inconsistent with market expectations. III. Expanding the Size of the Central Bank's Balance Sheet Besides changing the composition of its balance sheet, the central bank can also alter policy by changing the size of its balance sheet; that is, by buying or selling securities to affect the overall supply of reserves and the money stock. Of course, this strategy represents the conventional means of conducting monetary policy, as described in many textbooks. DATE, most central banks choose to calibrate the degree of policy ease or tightness by targeting the price of reserves--in the case of the Federal Reserve, the TIME federal funds rate. However, nothing prevents a central bank from switching its focus from the price of reserves to the quantity or growth of reserves. When stated in terms of quantities, it becomes apparent that even if the price of reserves (the federal funds rate) becomes pinned at zero, the central bank can still expand the quantity of reserves. That is, reserves can be increased beyond the level required to hold the TIME rate at zero--a policy sometimes referred to as \"quantitative easing.\" Some evidence exists that quantitative easing can stimulate the economy even when interest rates are near zero; see, for example, Christina Romer's (DATE) discussion of the effects of increases in the money supply during the Great Depression in the United States. Quantitative easing may affect the economy through several possible channels. One potential channel is based on the premise that money is an imperfect substitute for other financial assets (in contrast to the view discussed in the previous section that emphasizes the imperfect substitutability of various nonmoney assets). If this premise holds, then large increases in the money supply will lead investors to seek to rebalance their portfolios, raising prices and reducing yields on alternative, non-money assets. Lower yields on long-term assets will in turn stimulate economic activity. The possibility that monetary policy works through portfolio substitution effects, even in normal times, has a long intellectual history, having been espoused by both Keynesians (Tobin, DATE) and monetarists (Brunner and Meltzer, DATE). Recently, Javier Andres, J. David Lopez-Salido, and Edward Nelson (DATE) have shown how these effects might work in a general equilibrium model with optimizing agents. The practical importance of these effects remains an open question, however. Quantitative easing may also work by altering expectations of the future path of policy rates. For example, suppose that the central bank commits itself to keeping reserves at a high level, well above that needed to ensure a zero short-term interest rate, until certain economic conditions obtain. Theoretically, this action is equivalent to a commitment to keep interest rates at zero until the economic conditions are met, a type of policy we have already discussed. However, the act of setting and meeting a high reserves target is more visible, and hence may be more credible, than a purely verbal promise about future short-term interest rates. Moreover, this means of committing to a zero interest rate will also achieve any benefits of quantitative easing that may be felt through nonexpectational channels. Lastly, quantitative easing that is sufficiently aggressive and that is perceived to be long-lived may have expansionary fiscal effects. So long as market participants expect a positive short-term interest rate at some date in the future, the existence of government debt implies a current or future tax liability for the public. In expanding its balance sheet by open-market purchases, the central bank replaces public holdings of interest-bearing government debt with non-interest-bearing currency or reserves. If the open-market operation is not expected to be reversed too quickly, this exchange reduces the present and future interest costs of the government and the tax burden on the public. (Effectively, this process replaces a direct tax, say on labor, with the inflation tax.) Auerbach and Obstfeld (DATE) have analyzed the fiscal and expectational effects of a permanent increase in the money supply along these lines. Note that the expectational and fiscal channels of quantitative easing, though not the portfolio substitution channel, require the central bank to make a credible commitment to not reverse its openmarket operations, at least until certain conditions are met. Thus, this approach also poses communication challenges for monetary policy makers. Japan once again provides the most recent case study. In DATE, current account balances held by commercial banks at the Bank of Japan have increased about five-fold, and the monetary base has risen to almost NUM percent of nominal GDP. While deflation appears to have eased in Japan recently, it is difficult to know how much of the improvement is due to monetary policy, and, of the part due to monetary policy, how much is due to the zero-interest-rate policy and how much to quantitative easing. The experience of the United States with quantitative policies is limited to DATE, when the Federal Reserve targeted nonborrowed reserves. Of course, nominal interest rates were not close to zero at that time. The U.S. experience does suggest, however, that the demand for reserves may be sufficiently erratic that the effects of quantitative policies may be intrinsically hard to calibrate. IV. Sequencing and the \"Costs\" of Low Interest Rates The forms of monetary stimulus described above can be used once the TIME rate has already been driven to zero or as a way of driving the TIME rate to zero. However, a central bank might choose to rely on these alternative policies while maintaining the TIME rate somewhat above zero. For example, monetary policy makers might attempt to influence market expectations of future short rates as an alternative to changing the current setting of the TIME rate. Another possibility is to try to affect term premiums, expectations of future rates, or both, by changing the composition of securities held by the central bank. (Unlimited expansion of the total volume of securities held by the central bank is not compatible, of course, with a positive TIME rate.) The appropriate sequencing of policy actions depends on the perceived costs associated with very low or zero TIME interest rates, as well as on operational considerations and estimates of the likely effects of alternative combinations of policies on the economy. What costs are imposed on society by very low short-term interest rates? Observers have pointed out that rates on financial instruments typically priced below the TIME rate, such as liquid deposits, shares in money market mutual funds, and collateralized borrowings in the \"repo\" market, would be squeezed toward zero as the policy rate fell, prompting investors to seek alternatives. Short-term dislocations might result, for example, if funds flowed in large amounts from money market mutual funds into bank deposits. In that case, some commercial paper issuers who have traditionally relied on money market mutual funds for financing would have to seek out new sources, while banks would need to find productive uses for the deposit inflows and perhaps face changes in regulatory capital requirements. In addition, liquidity in some markets might be affected; for example, the incentive for reserve managers to trade federal funds diminishes as the TIME rate falls, probably thinning brokering in that market. In thinking about the costs associated with a low TIME rate, one should bear in mind the message of Milton Friedman's classic essay on the optimal quantity of money (Friedman, DATE). Friedman argued that an TIME interest rate of zero is optimal, because a zero opportunity cost of liquidity eliminates the socially wasteful use of resources to economize on money balances. From this perspective, the costs of low short-term interest rates can be seen largely as adjustment costs, arising from the unwinding of schemes designed to make holding transactions balances less burdensome. These costs are real but are also largely transitory and have limited sectoral impact. Moreover, to the extent that the affected institutions have economic functions other than helping clients economize on money balances (for example, if some money market mutual funds have a comparative advantage in lending to commercial paper issuers), there is scope for repricing that will allow these services to continue to be offered. Thus there seems to be little reason for central banks to avoid bringing the policy rate close to zero if the economic situation warranted. A quite different argument for engaging in alternative monetary policies before lowering the TIME rate all the way to zero is that the public might interpret a zero instrument rate as evidence that the central bank has \"run out of ammunition.\" That is, low rates risk fostering the misimpression that monetary policy is ineffective. As we have stressed, that would indeed be a misimpression, as the central bank has means of providing monetary stimulus other than the conventional measure of lowering the TIME nominal interest rate. However, it is also true that the considerable uncertainty that surrounds the use of these alternative measures does make the calibration of policy actions more difficult. Moreover, given the important role for expectations in making many of these policies work, the communications challenges would be considerable. Given these risks, policymakers are well advised to act preemptively and aggressively to avoid facing the complications raised by the zero lower bound.",

                  "Alan Greenspan: Risk and uncertainty in monetary policy Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, DATE. TIME I plan to sketch the key developments of DATE of monetary policy in the United States from the perspective of someone who has been in the policy trenches. I will offer some conclusions about what I believe has been learned thus far, though I suspect, as is so often the case, the passing of time, further study, and reflection will deepen our understanding of these developments. This is a personal statement; I am not speaking for my current colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the many others with whom I have served over these many DATE.NUM The tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in DATE, then led by my predecessor Paul Volcker, ultimately broke the back of price acceleration in the United States, ushering in a DATE long decline in inflation that eventually brought us to the current state of price stability. The fall in inflation over this period has been global in scope, and arguably beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic inflation fighters. I have little doubt that an unrelenting focus of monetary policy on achieving price stability has been the principal contributor to disinflation. Indeed, the notion, advanced by Milton Friedman DATE, that inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon is no longer a controversial proposition in the profession. But the size and geographic extent of the decline in inflation raises the question of whether other forces have been at work as well. I am increasingly of the view that, at a minimum, monetary policy in DATE has been operating in an environment particularly conducive to the pursuit of price stability. The principal features of this environment included (NUM) increased political support for stable prices, which was the consequence of, and reaction to, the unprecedented peacetime inflation in DATE, (NUM) globalization, which unleashed powerful new forces of competition, and (NUM) an acceleration of productivity, which at least for a time held down cost pressures. I believe we at the Fed, to our credit, did gradually come to recognize the structural economic changes that we were living through and accordingly altered our understanding of the key parameters of the economic system and our policy stance. The central banks of other industrialized countries have grappled with many of the same issues. But as we lived through it, there was much uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and about the influence of monetary policy. Despite those uncertainties, the trauma of DATE was still so vivid throughout DATE that preventing a return to accelerating prices was the unvarying focus of our efforts during DATE. In recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an important feature of policy. As a consequence, this approach elevated forecasting to an even more prominent place in policy deliberations. After an almost uninterrupted stint of easing from DATE, the Fed again began to lean against increasing inflationary pressures, which were in part the indirect result of rapidly rising stock prices. We had recognized the risk of an adverse reaction in a stock market that had recently experienced a steep run-up - indeed, we actively engaged in contingency planning against that possibility. In the event, the crash in DATE was far more traumatic than any of the possible scenarios we had identified. Previous planning was only marginally useful in that episode. We operated essentially in a crisis mode, responding with an immediate and massive injection of liquidity to help stabilize highly volatile financial markets. However, most of our stabilization efforts were directed at keeping the payments system functioning and markets open. The concern over the possible fallout on economic activity from so sharp a stock price decline kept us easing into DATE. But the economy weathered that shock reasonably well, and our easing extended perhaps longer than hindsight has indicated was necessary. That period was followed by a preemptive tightening that brought the federal funds rate close to NUM percent by DATE. In DATE, we sensed enough softening of activity to warrant beginning a series of rate reductions. However, the weakening of demand already under way, some pullback of credit by lenders, and the spike in oil prices associated with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were sufficient to produce a marked contraction of activity in DATE. But perhaps aided by our preemptive action, the recession was, to then, the mildest in postwar history. However, the recovery also was more modest than usual, in large measure because of the notable financial \"headwinds\" that confronted businesses. Those headwinds were primarily generated by the constriction of credit in response to major losses at banks, associated with real-estate and foreign lending, coupled with a crisis in the savings and loan industry that had its origins in a serious maturity mismatch as interest rates rose. With their access to managed funds threatened and the quality of their loan portfolio - and hence their capital - uncertain, these depositories were most reluctant to lend. Policy eased gradually but persistently to counter the effects of these developments, with the funds rate falling to NUM percent by DATE, its lowest level since DATE. The uptilt to the term structure of interest rates in a generally low interest rate environment restored bank profitability and, eventually, bank capital. The credit crunch slowly lifted. By DATE, as the headwinds of financial restraint abated, it became clear that underlying price pressures were again building. If we had left those pressures unchecked, we would have put at risk some of the hard-won gains that had been achieved over DATE. So, starting from a real federal funds rate that was close to zero, a preemptive tightening was initiated. The resulting rise in the funds rate of NUM basis points over DATE apparently defused those nascent inflationary pressures. Though economic activity hesitated in DATE, it soon steadied, confirming the achievement of a historically elusive soft landing. The success of that period set up two powerful expectations that were to influence developments over DATE. One was the expectation that inflation could be controlled over the business cycle and that price stability was an achievable objective. The second expectation, in part a consequence of more stable inflation, was that overall economic volatility had been reduced and would likely remain lower than it had previously. Of course, these new developments brought new challenges. In particular, the prospect that a necessary cyclical adjustment was now behind us fostered increasing levels of optimism, which were manifested in a fall in bond risk spreads and a rise in stock prices. The associated decline in the cost of equity capital further spurred already developing increases in capital investment and productivity growth, both of which broadened impressively in the latter part of DATE. The rise in structural productivity growth was not obvious in the official data on gross product per hour worked until DATE, but precursors had emerged earlier. The pickup in new bookings and order backlogs for high-tech capital goods in DATE seemed incongruous given the sluggish economic environment at the time. Plant managers apparently were reacting to what they perceived to be elevated prospective rates of return on the newer technologies, a judgment that was confirmed as orders and profits continued to increase through DATE. Moreover, even though TIME labor compensation and profit margins were rising, prices were being contained, implying increasing growth in output per hour.NUM As a consequence of the improving trend in structural productivity growth that was apparent from DATE forward, we at the Fed were able to be much more accommodative to the rise in economic growth than our past experiences would have deemed prudent. We were motivated, in part, by the view that the evident structural economic changes rendered suspect, at best, the prevailing notion in DATE of an elevated and reasonably stable NAIRU. Those views were reinforced as inflation continued to fall in the context of a declining unemployment rate that by DATE had dipped below NUM percent in the United States for the first time in DATE. Notions that prevailed for a time in DATE and DATE that even high single-digit inflation did not measurably impede economic growth were gradually abandoned as the evidence of significant benefits of low inflation became increasingly persuasive. Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the DATE. To preserve these benefits, we engaged in our most recent preemptive tightening in DATE that brought the funds rate to NUM-NUM/NUM percent by May DATE. Our goal of price stability was achieved by most analysts' definition by DATE. Unstinting and largely preemptive efforts over DATE had finally paid off. Throughout the period, a key objective has been to ensure that our response to incipient changes in inflation was forceful enough. As John Taylor has emphasized, in the face of an incipient increase in inflation, nominal interest rates must move up more than one-for-one.NUM Perhaps the greatest irony of DATE is that the gradually unfolding success against inflation may well have contributed to the stock price bubble of the latter part of DATE.NUM Looking back on DATE, it is evident that technology-driven increases in productivity growth imparted significant upward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to stock prices.NUM At the same time, an environment of increasing macroeconomic stability reduced perceptions of risk. In any event, Fed policymakers were confronted with forces that none of us had previously encountered. Aside from the then-recent experience of Japan, only remote historical episodes gave us clues to the appropriate stance for policy under such conditions. The sharp rise in stock prices and their subsequent fall were, thus, an especial challenge to the Federal Reserve. It is far from obvious that bubbles, even if identified early, can be preempted at lower cost than a substantial economic contraction and possible financial destabilization - the very outcomes we would be seeking to avoid. In fact, our experience over the past DATE suggests that a moderate monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without substantial effect on economic activity has often been associated with increases subsequent in the level of stock prices.NUM Arguably, markets that pass that type of stress test are presumed particularly resilient. The notion that a well-timed incremental tightening could have NUM See, for example, \"A Half-Century of Changes in Monetary Policy,\" John B. Taylor, remarks delivered at the conference in honor of Milton Friedman, DATE, pp NUM-NUM, manuscript, Department of the Treasury. NUM It is notable, that in the United States, surges in price-earnings ratios, a presumed essential characteristic of an equity price bubble, are not observed with elevated inflation expectations. NUM But, as the Federal Reserve indicated in congressional testimony in DATE, \"... productivity acceleration does not ensure that equity prices are not overextended. There can be little doubt that if the nation's productivity growth has stepped up, the level of profits and their future potential would be elevated. That prospect has supported higher stock prices. The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future become relatively small. Such straying above fundamentals could create problems for our economy when the inevitable adjustment occurs.\" Testimony of Alan Greenspan before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, DATE. NUM For example, stock prices rose following the completion of the more than NUM basis point rise in the federal funds rate in the DATE ending in February NUM. And during DATE in DATE, when the Federal Reserve again raised the federal funds target NUM basis points, stock prices initially flattened. But as soon as that round of tightening was completed, prices resumed their marked upward advance. From DATE through May DATE, the federal funds rate was raised NUM basis points. However, equity price increases were largely undeterred during that period despite what now, in retrospect, was the exhausted tail of a bull market. Stock prices peaked in March DATE, but the market basically moved sideways until DATE. Such data suggest that nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic retrenchment with all its attendant risks is sufficient to check a nascent bubble. Certainly, NUM basis points proved inadequate to even dent stock prices in DATE. BIS Review DATE been calibrated to prevent DATE bubble while preserving economic stability is almost surely an illusion.NUM Instead of trying to contain a putative bubble by drastic actions with largely unpredictable consequences, we chose, as we noted in our DATE congressional testimony, to focus on policies \"to mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next expansion.\"NUM During DATE, in the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble and the acts of terrorism in September DATE, the federal funds rate was lowered NUM-NUM/NUM percentage points. Subsequently, another NUM basis points were pared, bringing the rate by DATE to its current NUM percent, the lowest level in DATE. We were able to be unusually aggressive in the initial stages of the recession of DATE because both inflation and inflation expectations were low and stable. We thought we needed to be, and could be, forceful in DATE and DATE as well because, with demand weak, inflation risks had become two-sided for the first time in DATE. There appears to be enough evidence, at least tentatively, to conclude that our strategy of addressing the bubble's consequences rather than the bubble itself has been successful. Despite the stock market plunge, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we experienced an exceptionally mild recession - even milder than that of DATE. As I discuss later, much of the ability of the U.S. economy to absorb these sequences of shocks resulted from notably improved structural flexibility. But highly aggressive monetary ease was doubtless also a significant contributor to stability.NUM The Federal Reserve's experiences over the past DATE make it clear that uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape. The term \"uncertainty\" is meant here to encompass both \"Knightian uncertainty,\" in which the probability distribution of outcomes is unknown, and \"risk,\" in which uncertainty of outcomes is delimited by a known probability distribution. In practice, one is never quite sure what type of uncertainty one is dealing with in real time, and it may be best to think of a continuum ranging from well-defined risks to the truly unknown. As a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management. This conceptual framework emphasizes understanding as much as possible the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakers face, quantifying those NUM Some have asserted that the Federal Reserve can deflate a stock-price bubble - rather painlessly - by boosting margin requirements. The evidence suggests otherwise. First, the amount of margin debt is small, having never amounted to more than about NUM-NUM/NUM percent of the market value of equities; moreover, even this figure overstates the amount of margin debt used to purchase stock, as such debt also finances short sales of equity and transactions in non-equity securities. Second, investors need not rely on margin debt to take a leveraged position in equities. They can borrow from other sources to buy stock. Or, they can purchase options, which will affect stock prices given the linkages across markets. Thus, not surprisingly, the preponderance of research suggests that changes in margins are not an effective tool for reducing stock market volatility. It is possible that margin requirements inhibit very small investors whose access to other forms of credit is limited. If so, the only effect of increasing margin requirements is to price out of the market the very small investor without addressing the broader issue of stock price bubbles. If a change in margin requirements were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank would soon tighten monetary policy enough to burst a bubble, then there might be the appearance of a causal effect. But it is the prospect of monetary policy action, not the margin increase, that should be viewed as the trigger. In a similar manner, history tells us that \"jawboning\" asset markets will be ineffective unless backed by action. NUM Op. cit. NUM Some have argued that, as a consequence of the DATE-DATE speculative episode, long-term imbalances remain, having been only partly addressed since early DATE, the peak of the post-bubble business cycle. For example, large residues of household and external debt are perceived as barriers to future growth. But in the past, imbalances that led to business contractions were rarely fully reversed before the subsequent economic upturn began. Presumably they were fully reversed in later periods, or they continued to fester, but not by enough to halt economic growth. Even if imbalances still persist in our current environment, the business decline that began in March DATE came to an end in DATE, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. We experienced tepid recovery until DATE, when GDP accelerated considerably. Hence, when the next recession arrives, as it inevitably will, it will be a stretch to attribute it to speculative imbalances of DATE. BIS Review DATE risks when possible, and assessing the costs associated with each of the risks. In essence, the risk management approach to monetary policymaking is an application of Bayesian decisionmaking. This framework also entails devising, in light of those risks, a strategy for policy directed at maximizing the probabilities of achieving over time our goals of price stability and the maximum sustainable economic growth that we associate with it. In designing strategies to meet our policy objectives, we have drawn on the work of analysts, both inside and outside the Fed, who over DATE have devoted much effort to improving our understanding of the economy and its monetary transmission mechanism. A critical result has been the identification of a relatively small set of key relationships that, taken together, provide a useful approximation of our economy's dynamics. Such an approximation underlies the statistical models that we at the Federal Reserve employ to assess the likely influence of our policy decisions. However, despite extensive efforts to capture and quantify what we perceive as the key macroeconomic relationships, our knowledge about many of the important linkages is far from complete and, in all likelihood, will always remain so. Every model, no matter how detailed or how well designed, conceptually and empirically, is a vastly simplified representation of the world that we experience with all its intricacies on a day-to-day basis. Given our inevitably incomplete knowledge about key structural aspects of an ever-changing economy and the sometimes asymmetric costs or benefits of particular outcomes, a central bank needs to consider not only the most likely future path for the economy but also the distribution of possible outcomes about that path. The decisionmakers then need to reach a judgment about the probabilities, costs, and benefits of the various possible outcomes under alternative choices for policy. A policy action that is calculated to be optimal based on a simulation of one particular model may not, in fact, be optimal once the full extent of the risks surrounding the most likely path is taken into account. In general, different policies will exhibit different degrees of robustness with respect to the true underlying structure of the economy. For example, policy A might be judged as best advancing the policymakers' objectives, conditional on a particular model of the economy, but might also be seen as having relatively severe adverse consequences if the true structure of the economy turns out to be other than the one assumed. On the other hand, policy B might be somewhat less effective in advancing the policy objectives under the assumed baseline model but might be relatively benign in the event that the structure of the economy turns out to differ from the baseline. DATE, these considerations inclined Federal Reserve policymakers toward an easier stance of policy aimed at limiting the risk of deflation even though baseline forecasts from most conventional models at that time did not project deflation; that is, we chose a policy that, in a world of perfect certainty, would have been judged to be too loose. As this episode illustrates, policy practitioners operating under a risk-management paradigm may, at times, be led to undertake actions intended to provide insurance against especially adverse outcomes. Following the Russian debt default in DATE, for example, the FOMC eased policy despite our perception that the economy was expanding at a satisfactory pace and that, even without a policy initiative, it was likely to continue doing so.NUM We eased policy because we were concerned about the low-probability risk that the default might trigger events that would severely disrupt domestic and international financial markets, with outsized adverse feedback to the performance of the U.S. economy. The product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious threat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable scenario. That possibility of higher inflation caused us little concern at the time, largely because increased productivity growth was resulting in only limited increases in unit labor costs and heightened competition, driven by globalization, was thwarting employers' ability to pass through those limited cost increases into prices. Given the potential consequences of the Russian default, the benefits of the unusual policy action were judged to outweigh its costs. Such a cost-benefit analysis is an ongoing part of monetary policy decisionmaking and causes us to tip more toward monetary ease when a contractionary event, such as the Russian default, seems especially likely or the costs associated with it seem especially high. The DATE liquidity crisis and the crises associated with the stock market crash of DATE and the terrorism of September DATE prompted the type of massive ease that has been the historic mandate of a central bank. Such crises are precipitated by the efforts of market participants to convert illiquid assets into cash. When confronted with uncertainty, especially Knightian uncertainty, human beings invariably attempt to disengage from medium to long-term commitments in favor of safety and liquidity. Because economies, of necessity, are net long - that is, have net real assets - attempts to flee these assets cause prices of equity assets to fall, in some cases dramatically. In the crisis that emerged in DATE, pressures extended beyond equity markets. Credit-risk spreads widened materially and investors put a particularly high value on liquidity, as evidenced by the extraordinarily wide yield gaps that emerged between on-the-run and off-the-run U.S. Treasuries. The immediate response on the part of the central bank to such financial implosions must be to inject large quantities of liquidity - or as Walter Bagehot put it, describing such policies of the Bank of England DATE, in a panic the Bank should lend at very high rates of interest \"to all that bring good securities quickly, freely, and readily.\"NUM This was perhaps an early articulation of a crisis risk management policy for a central bank. The economic world in which we function is best described by a structure whose parameters are continuously changing. The channels of monetary policy, consequently, are changing in tandem. An ongoing challenge for the Federal Reserve - indeed, for any central bank - is to operate in a way that does not depend on a fixed economic structure based on historically average coefficients. We often fit simple models only because we cannot estimate a continuously changing set of parameters without vastly more observations than are currently available to us. Moreover, we recognize that the simple linear functions underlying most of our econometric structures may not hold outside the range in which adequate economic observations exist. For example, it is difficult to have much confidence in the ability of models fit to the data of the moderate inflations of the postwar period to accurately predict what the behavior of the economy would be in an environment of aggregate price deflation. In pursuing a risk-management approach to policy, we must confront the fact that only a limited number of risks can be quantified with any confidence. And even these risks are generally quantifiable only if we accept the assumption that the future will, at least in some important respects, resemble the past. Policymakers often have to act, or choose not to act, even though we may not fully understand the full range of possible outcomes, let alone each possible outcome's likelihood. As a result, risk management often involves significant judgment as we evaluate the risks of different events and the probability that our actions will alter those risks. For such judgment, policymakers have needed to reach beyond models to broader - though less mathematically precise - hypotheses about how the world works. For example, inferences about how market participants and, hence, the economy might respond to a monetary policy initiative may need to be drawn from evidence about past behavior during a period only roughly comparable to the current situation. Some critics have argued that such an approach to policy is too undisciplined - judgmental, seemingly discretionary, and difficult to explain. The Federal Reserve, they conclude, should attempt to be more formal in its operations by tying its actions solely, or in the weaker paradigm, largely, to the prescriptions of a simple policy rule. Indeed, rules that relate the setting of the federal funds rate to the deviations of output and inflation from their respective targets, in some configurations, do seem to capture the broad contours of what we did over DATE. And the prescriptions of formal rules can, in fact, serve as helpful adjuncts to policy, as many of the proponents of these rules have suggested. But at crucial points, like those in our recent policy history - the stock market crash of DATE, the crises of DATE, and the events that followed September DATE - simple rules will be inadequate as either descriptions or prescriptions for policy. Moreover, such rules suffer from much of the same fixed-coefficient difficulties we have with our large-scale models. To be sure, sensible policymaking can be accomplished only with the aid of a rigorous analytic structure. A rule does provide a benchmark against which to assess emerging developments. However, any rule capable of encompassing every possible contingency would lose a key aspect of its attractiveness: simplicity. On the other hand, no simple rule could possibly describe the policy action to be taken in every contingency and thus provide a satisfactory substitute for an approach based on the principles of risk management. As I indicated earlier, policy has worked off a risk-management paradigm in which the risk and costbenefit analyses depend on forecasts of probabilities developed from large macromodels, numerous submodels, and judgments based on less mathematically precise regimens. Such judgments, by their nature, are based on bits and pieces of history that cannot formally be associated with an analysis of variance. Yet, there is information in those bits and pieces. For example, while we have been unable to readily construct a variable that captures the apparent increased degree of flexibility in the United States or the global economy, there has been too much circumstantial evidence of this critically important trend to ignore its existence. Increased flexibility is a likely source of changing structural coefficients. Our problem is not, as is sometimes alleged, the complexity of our policymaking process, but the far greater complexity of a world economy whose underlying linkages appear to be continuously evolving. Our response to that continuous evolution has been disciplined by the Bayesian type of decisionmaking in which we have engaged. While all, no doubt, would prefer that it were otherwise, there is no way to dismiss what has to be obvious to every monetary policymaker: The success of monetary policy depends importantly on the quality of forecasting. The ability to gauge risks implies some judgment about how current economic imbalances will ultimately play out. Thus, both econometric and qualitative models need to be continually tested. The first signs that a relationship may have changed is usually the emergence of events that seem inconsistent with our hypotheses of the way the economic world is supposed to behave. The anomalous rise in high-tech capital goods orders in DATE, to which I alluded earlier, is one such example. The credit crunch of DATE is another. The emergence of inflation targeting in DATE is an interesting development in this regard. As practiced, it emphasizes forecasts, but within a more rule-like structure that skews monetary policy toward inflation containment as the primary goal. Indeed, its early applications were in high-inflation countries where discretionary monetary policy fell into disrepute. Inflation targeting often originated as a fairly simple structure concentrating solely on inflation outcomes, but it has evolved into more-discretionary forms requiring complex judgments for implementation. Indeed, this evolution has gone so far that the actual practice of monetary policy by inflation-targeting central banks now closely resembles the practice of those central banks, such as the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve, that have not chosen to adopt that paradigm. In practice, most central banks, at least those not bound by an exchange rate peg, behave in roughly the same way. They seek price stability as their long-term goal and, accounting for the lag in monetary policy, calibrate the setting of the policy rate accordingly. Central banks generally appear to have embraced a common model of the channels through which monetary policy functions, although the specifics and emphasis given to those channels vary according to our particular circumstances. All banks ease when economic conditions ease and tighten when economic conditions tighten, even if in differing degrees, regardless of whether they are guided by",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Monetary policy and the economic outlook - DATE Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, NUM January DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    DATE is the traditional time to review the high and low points of DATE just past and to contemplate the challenges that lie ahead in DATE just begun. In that spirit, I will provide a brief progress report on the economic recovery, as well as some remarks on the evolution of monetary policy. As always, the views I will express are my own and are not to be attributed to my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.NUM It is beginning to appear that DATE was DATE for the American economy, following what had been, on many dimensions, a subpar performance for the better part of DATE. Though officially the recession lasted DATE, from DATE, a period of economic underperformance began with the sharp decline in stock prices and business investment in mid-NUM and continued through DATE leading up to the Iraq war DATE. To a degree that is unusual for postwar recessions, the economic weakness of the period was most apparent in the business sector, even as consumer spending and residential construction remained robust. Businesses radically pared their spending on new capital goods and cut the ratio of inventory stocks to sales to historical lows. In an effort to restore profitability in an environment of weak demand and nonexistent pricing power, businesses also worked hard to improve efficiency and cut costs. These efforts have paid off in terms of remarkable increases in productivity, but, together with insufficient growth in aggregate demand, they also contributed to a significant decline in employment. Like the aftermath of the DATE recession, DATE since the recession trough in DATE have been described as a \"jobless recovery.\" Indeed, the lag between the recovery in output and the recovery in employment has been significantly greater this time than it was after the DATE downturn. Monetary policy was deployed to support the weakening economy, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) aggressively cut rates in DATE and has continued its policy of accommodation since then. Fiscal policy, including two rounds of tax cuts, has also been highly stimulative. However, despite some early promise, initially the upturn proved halting and erratic. Policymakers and privatesector economists recognized early on that a balanced recovery would require willingness on the part of the business sector to begin investing and hiring again, but forecasts of improved business sentiment repeatedly proved wrong, or at least premature. In some sectors, such as nonresidential construction and communications, capital overhangs and capital misallocation, the result of the earlier boom, reduced both the need and the financial capacity to invest. Importantly, the economy was also hit by a succession of shocks - notably the September NUM, DATE, terrorist attacks, the corporate governance and accounting scandals of DATE, and the Iraq war in DATE DATE - each of which created new uncertainties and left its mark on business confidence. Despite all this adversity, there could never have been any doubt that the diversified and resilient U.S. economy, assisted by ample monetary and fiscal stimulus, would eventually stage a comeback. After several false starts, it now appears that that comeback began in earnest in the summer of DATE. As you know, the third quarter of DATE displayed near-record levels of real economic growth, in the vicinity of NUM percent at an DATE rate, and growth appears to have continued strong in the fourth quarter of DATE. The most heartening aspect of this vigorous expansion is that, finally, the business sector appears to have emerged from its funk. Corporate investment has been strong, particularly in equipment and software, and there are some recent signs that both inventory investment and hiring have begun to pick up. Of course, downside risks to the economy remain: The recovery in capital investment may prove less durable than it now appears, the moderation of fiscal stimulus in the latter part of DATE could adversely affect household spending, or new unfavorable shocks - geopolitical or otherwise - may yet appear. Still, the incoming data have continued for the most part to surprise on the upside, and the odds accordingly have increased that DATE will be remembered as DATE when this recovery turned the corner. Private-sector forecasters generally expect real growth to be approximately NUM percent in DATE, and they foresee modest improvements in the unemployment rate DATE and continued reductions in unemployment in DATE. I think these predictions are broadly reasonable, and indeed I would not be surprised if the pace of real growth DATE exceeded NUM percent. With this generally upbeat scenario in mind, some observers in the markets and the media have questioned the appropriateness of the current stance of monetary policy. Certainly, the policy stance we have DATE is historically unusual. DATE after the recession trough, and following DATE of strong growth, the historically normal pattern would be for the Fed to be well into the process of tightening policy by now. Instead, the FOMC has held its policy instrument rate, the federal funds rate, at the very low level of NUM percent. I would like to take some time now to explain why I believe this policy remains appropriate, despite its historically unusual character. The positive case for maintaining an accommodative monetary policy at this stage of the recovery has three elements, some of which will be familiar to many of you, at least in broad outline. First, core inflation rates in the United States are as low DATE as they have been in DATE, and they have been trending downward. For example, the DATE inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index, current-methods basis and excluding food and energy prices, was NUM percent at the recession trough in DATE. This measure of core inflation fell to NUM percent as of DATE and to only NUM percent as of November DATE. Other measures of core inflation, such as the one based on the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, have displayed a similar pattern. Inflation is not simply low; for my taste, it is very nearly at the bottom of the acceptable range for (measured) inflation. In contrast, in previous episodes of recovery, inflation was above the range consistent with price stability, so that a tightening of monetary policy at an earlier stage of the expansion represented the prudent response to inflation risks. Because inflation is so low DATE, monetary policy can afford to be more patient to ensure that the recovery is self-sustaining. The second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable increase in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in DATE. Those productivity increases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for given growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of production, which puts downward pressure on prices. I will first address the effect of productivity on costs, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap. Labor costs account for the lion's share, about two-thirds, of the cost of producing goods and services. The labor cost of producing a unit of output depends, first, on the dollar cost per hour (including wages and benefits) of employing a worker and, second, on the quantity of output that each worker produces per hour. When the cost per hour of employing a worker rises more quickly than the worker's TIME productivity - the historically normal situation - then the dollar labor cost of producing each unit of output, the so-called unit labor cost, tends to rise. Recently, however, labor productivity has grown even more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have declined in each of the past DATE. Indeed, in the second and third quarters of DATE, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector are currently estimated to have declined by a remarkable NUM and NUM percent, respectively, at DATE rates. Again, because labor costs are such a large part of overall costs, and because capital costs have also been moderate, the business sector has enjoyed a net decline in total production costs. A decline in production costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for producers, or both. In practice, both have occurred in DATE: Firms have passed on part of the reduction in costs on to final consumers in the form of lower (or more slowly rising) prices, and pricecost markups (as best we can measure them) have risen well above their historical averages. The high level of markups is an important and perhaps insufficiently recognized feature of the current economic situation. To the extent that firms can maintain these markups, profits will continue to be high, supporting investment and equity values. To the extent that product-market competition erodes these markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate, even if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.NUM The third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market. As I already noted, fully DATE after the official recession trough, we are only just beginning to see significant gains in employment. Of course, the unemployment rate, at about NUM percent of the labor force, is not exceptionally high by historical standards, and one can debate the degree to which structural change and other factors may have affected the level of employment that can be sustained without overheating the economy. Assessing the amount of slack in the labor market is very difficult and ultimately a matter of judgment. Reasonable people can certainly disagree. However, my sense is that, when one looks at the full range of information available, the labor market looks (if anything) weaker than a NUM percent unemployment rate suggests. For example, it appears that workers who have lost their jobs in DATE have been more likely to withdraw from the labor force (rather than report themselves as unemployed) than were job losers in previous recessions. Indeed, the labor force participation rate fell sharply between NUM and DATE, from a little over NUM percent to about NUM-NUM/NUM percent. Similarly, the ratio of employment to the working-age population, a statistic that reflects both those who become unemployed and those who leave the labor force, has fallen significantly, by NUM percentage points between its peak in DATE and its trough DATE. The tendency of recent job losers to leave the labor force likely masks some of the effects of job cuts on the unemployment rate, so that the current measured level of unemployment may understate the extent of job loss or the difficulty of finding new work. Of course, a labor market that is slack and improving only slowly is likely to produce continued slow growth in nominal wages, contributing to continued moderate growth in costs. Why has the labor market remained relatively weak, despite increasingly rapid growth in output? I addressed the causes of the \"jobless recovery\" in an earlier talk (Bernanke, DATE). Although many factors have affected the rate of job creation, I concluded in my earlier analysis that the rapid rate of productivity growth, already discussed in relation to unit labor costs, has also been an important reason for the slow pace of recovery in the labor market. All else equal, strong productivity gains allow firms to meet a given level of demand with fewer employees. Thus, for given growth in aggregate spending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.NUM To summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my view) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy. First, inflation is historically low, perhaps at the bottom of the acceptable range, and has recently continued its decline. Second, rapid productivity growth has led to actual declines in nominal production costs, which reduce current and future inflationary pressures. Finally, the labor market remains soft, reflecting the fact that growth in aggregate demand has been so far insufficient to absorb the increases in aggregate supply afforded by higher productivity. A soft labor market will keep a lid on the growth in the cost of employing workers. An accommodative monetary policy is needed, in my view, to support the ongoing recovery, particularly in the labor market. At the same time, the risks of policy accommodation seem low, as inflation is low and inflation pressures seem quite subdued. These arguments notwithstanding, I realize that some remain unconvinced that the FOMC is pursuing the right course. Citing factors such as the rise in commodity prices and the decline of the dollar, a number of observers have warned that the Federal Reserve's policies risk re-igniting inflation. I would like to address these concerns briefly. Naturally, I will try to show why these arguments are not of immediate concern, given the three points I made earlier in support of the current accommodative policy. Before I do that, though, I would like to emphasize to those uncomfortable with the Fed's policy stance that, speaking for myself at least, their views are being heard and taken seriously. Achieving price stability in the United States was an historic accomplishment, and preserving that legacy is crucially important. I say that not only because I think that price stability promotes long-run growth and efficiency, which I do, but also because I believe that low inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations are critical to maintaining economic stability in the short run. Price stability is of utmost importance to the nation's economic health, and I believe that the FOMC will do whatever is necessary to be sure that inflation remains well contained. With that preface, I will address briefly a few concerns of those who worry that inflation is poised to rise, beginning with the recent behavior of commodity prices. A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over DATE, including a large jump in DATE. This acceleration has been broadly mirrored in the behavior of the core producer price indexes (PPIs) for crude and intermediate materials, probably the best and most comprehensive measures of prices at early stages of processing. Specifically, over the past DATE, the DATE change in the core PPI for crude materials has risen rather dramatically, from -NUM percent to NUM percent, and the DATE change in the core PPI for intermediate materials has risen from -NUM percent to NUM percent. Do these developments imply a significant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer? The answer is almost certainly not. Two points should be made. First, the recent movements in commodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business cycle. The acceleration in the core PPI for crude materials that we have seen is about what should have been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide economic activity.NUM The increase in the demand for commodities from China alone has been substantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen from less than NUM percent in DATE to NUM percent in DATE. The much more moderate acceleration in intermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some additional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy prices. Second, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule, both because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in the cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors. Accelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred following the DATE and DATE recessions, as well as in DATE and DATE, with no noticeable impact on inflation at the consumer level.NUM A reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent NUM percent increase in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a NUM percent increase in the price of intermediate goods and to less than a NUM percent increase in consumer prices. Thus the recent acceleration in commodity prices, even if it were to persist (and futures prices suggest that it will not), would likely add only a tenth or two to the core inflation rate. In short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of strengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level. Two specific commodity prices that often command attention are the prices of gold and crude petroleum. The price of gold has increased roughly NUM percent since its low in April DATE, from about $NUM per ounce to about $NUM per ounce. A portion of that increase simply reflects dollar depreciation, which I will discuss momentarily. Gold also represents a safe haven investment, however, and I agree that there have been periods in the past when the fear that drove investors into gold was the fear of inflation. But gold prices also respond to geopolitical tensions; these tensions have certainly heightened since DATE and, in my view, can account for the bulk of the recent increase in the real price of gold. Oil prices are relatively high, in the range of $NUM/barrel, but they have been elevated for most of DATE, despite a broadly disinflationary environment. According to futures markets, oil prices are expected to decline gradually over the next DATE, despite accelerating economic activity, as new supplies are brought on line. Of course, there is considerable uncertainty about what the price of oil will do, given the possibility of supply disruptions. But if it follows the course projected by the futures market, the price of oil should have a modest disinflationary effect on overall consumer prices in DATE. Let me turn now to the recent depreciation of the dollar and its implications for inflation. The dollar has fallen dramatically against some major currencies, notably the euro, against which the dollar has declined roughly NUM percent from its recent peak in DATE. However, looking at movements of the dollar against a single currency can be misleading about overall trends; broader measures of dollar strength show somewhat less of a decline. For example, an index of the dollar's real value against the currencies of important U.S. trading partners, weighted by trade shares, has fallen only about NUM percent from its peak in DATE. Notably, this broader index of dollar value remains about NUM percent above its average value in the DATEs and NUM percent above the low it reached in DATE. Moreover, the direct effects of dollar depreciation on inflation, like those of commodity price increases, appear to be relatively small. In part, the small effect reflects the modest weight of imports in the consumer's basket of goods and services. Perhaps more importantly, however, the evidence suggests that foreign producers tend to absorb most of the effect of changes in the value of the dollar rather than \"passing through\" these effects to the prices they charge U.S. consumers. A reasonable estimate of the portion of changes in the value of the dollar passed through to U.S. consumers is about NUM percent. The extent of passthrough also appears to have declined over time, suggesting that foreign producers also lack \"pricing power\" in the current low-inflation environment in the United States. Overall, on rough estimates, a NUM percent decline in the broad value of the dollar would be expected to add between one and three tenths to the level of core consumer prices (not the inflation rate), spread out over a period of time. I haven't said anything yet about the rate of growth of the money supply, another indicator that is sometimes cited by those concerned about inflation, largely because there is not too much to say. Growth in standard monetary measures such as the base and M2 has been moderate (and declining) in DATE, certainly well within expected ranges given the growth of nominal GDP and normal variation in velocity. For example, for DATE as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP. Even should money growth rates accelerate, however, I would caution against making strong inferences about the likely behavior of inflation, except in the very long run. Money growth has not proven to be especially useful for predicting inflation in the short run, in part because various institutional factors unrelated to monetary policy often affect the growth rate of money. A striking example of the way special factors can affect money growth rates is the fact that M2 growth has actually been sharply negative, at about -NUM percent at an DATE rate, for DATE for which data are available. Factors such as the falloff in mortgage refinancing activity and outflows from retail money market funds into equities and other investments are the proximate explanations for the decline in M2. Certainly, this short-term decline in broad money is not to be taken as evidence of tight monetary policy!NUM To summarize, DATE seems to have marked the turning point for the U. S. economy, and we have reason to be optimistic that DATE will see even more growth and continued progress in reducing unemployment. The remarkable strength and resiliency of the American economy - an economy that has shown the capacity to grow and become more productive in the face of serious adverse shocks - deserve most of the credit for these developments. Highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies have also played a role, of course. The Federal Reserve enters DATE with monetary policy that is unusually accommodative in historical terms, relative to the stage of the business cycle. That accommodation is justified, I believe, by the current very low level of inflation, and by the productivity gains and the weakness in the labor market, both of which suggest that inflation is likely to remain subdued. In my view, weighing the relative costs of the upside and downside risks also favors accommodation; in particular, it is important that we ensure, as best we can, that the current expansion will become self-sustaining and that the inflation rate does not fall further. On the other side, as I have already noted, the achievement of price stability must not and will not be jeopardized. We at the Federal Reserve will closely monitor developments in prices and wages, as well as conditions in the labor market and the broader economy, for any sign of incipient inflation. We will also look at the information that can be drawn from surveys and financial markets about inflation expectations. For now, I believe that the Federal Reserve has the luxury of being patient. However, I am also confident that, when the time comes, the Fed will act to ensure that inflation remains firmly under control.",

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Lessons from past productivity booms Speech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website. As we are all well aware, the United States has been enjoying significantly faster productivity growth for DATE than it did over DATE. Since DATE, labor productivity has risen at an average DATE rate of about NUM percent, up from an average DATE rate of around NUM-NUM/NUM percent between DATE and DATE. And in DATE alone, output per hour has increased more than NUM percent per year. The significance of the improvement since DATE can hardly be overstated, even after taking into account the cyclical component of DATE. If productivity were to continue to improve at an average DATE rate of NUM percent, the standard of living in the United States would double roughly every twenty-four years. If, on the other hand, productivity growth were to revert to an average DATE pace of NUM-NUM/NUM percent, a doubling in the standard of living would occur only every DATE. Many observers-including some economists-argue that the present era of robust trend productivity growth will soon come to an end. Others are more optimistic and argue that the potential gains to productivity from the technological advances associated with the computer revolution are far from complete.NUM Because productivity growth is critical to economic welfare, assessing the likelihood of these alternative outcomes is of considerable interest. In thinking about this issue, it is worth recognizing that periods of strong trend productivity growth, although perhaps novel to many of us, are not new to the U.S. economy. In fact, three earlier periods seem to stand out from the historical record as especially worthy of further scrutiny for the lessons they may offer regarding the current episode: a period in DATE from roughly the end of the Civil War to around DATE; DATE between the end of World War I and the onset of the Great Depression; and the period from DATE to the early 1970s.NUM Of particular note is that in at least two of the earlier episodes, heightened productivity growth lasted for an extended period - roughly twenty years or so. Thus, one objective in examining these previous productivity booms is to see whether we can glean any insights into the best ways to sustain the current episode of strong productivity growth. To be sure, each period mentioned can be associated with particular advances in technology, implying that technological progress is a necessary component of trend productivity growth. But significant technological advances were also evident in periods when productivity growth was less robust. Thus, a natural question to ask is whether other complementary factors - including aspects of the labor market, of the business environment, or of government policies - combine to render technological change especially potent or help to foster the transmission of technological change into real gains in the efficiency of the production process. Similarly, examining the historical record may shed light on the sustainability of the current boom. Do productivity booms simply run out of steam and die natural deaths? Or are they cut short by economic imbalances, exogenous shocks, or detrimental government policies? And, if the latter, are these cessations inevitable? At the outset, I should note that this lecture is co-authored with William Wascher, who is a member of the staff at the Board of Governors. To provide a roadmap of where we intend to go, I want to start by setting out some basic facts about previous periods of strong productivity growth in the United States. I will, of course, begin with some numbers. But I also want to discuss some of the technological innovations that contributed to these productivity booms and about the supportive roles played by changes in the organization of American businesses and the structure of financial markets, and by the U.S. education system. Finally, I will spend some time on the lessons that we think can be learned from what, in many ways, are striking similarities across the three previous episodes and the current one. Identifying previous productivity booms I should also note at this point that even the basic facts about economic growth, not to mention the interpretation of those facts, are sometimes subject to considerable debate. Some of these disagreements undoubtedly result from the lack of consistent information on U.S. productivity before data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) became available in DATE. For DATE period, we use data developed in DATE by John Kendrick, who constructed estimates of GDP consistent with the prevailing definitions in the National Income and Product Accounts going back to DATE (which had as their basis estimates made by Simon Kuznets in DATE).NUM These estimates are often cited as the best available measure of U.S output and productivity growth for that period. Although subsequent researchers - notably Balke and Gordon (DATE) and Romer (DATE) - have refined these estimates in different ways, the additional refinements focus primarily on the cyclical properties of output and do not significantly alter the qualitative statements about long-run growth made here. A number of economic historians - most notably Robert Gallman - have estimated U.S. GDP for the period before the Civil War.NUM However, given that their estimates are surely less reliable than those for the later, more industrialized period, we have elected to limit the focus of this lecture to the post-Civil War period. These caveats aside, average growth rates of productivity over various periods are presented in the table. We will focus on labor productivity (the first column) because that measure is the best indicator of improvement in the nation's standard of living. For the entire period from DATE, labor productivity has risen at an average rate of around NUM percent per year. However, productivity growth has not proceeded in a steady fashion. We have chosen time periods for our analysis that smooth through the business cycle, which is a significant source of shorter-term changes in rates of productivity growth. More important for this discussion is the variation in labor productivity growth that has occurred over longer stretches of time, with periods of robust growth interspersed with periods of more modest productivity gains. Using the Kendrick data as a guide and recognizing that the choice of any particular period is somewhat subjective, we take as the first episode of strong productivity growth - or productivity boom, if you will - roughly the period from DATE. During this period, labor productivity rose more than NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year, a rate thought to be considerably higher than the average growth experienced over DATE of the United States.NUM An important element of the analysis of this and other periods is the decomposition of output per hour into its underlying sources, including the contributions of multifactor productivity, capital deepening, and labor quality. In this regard, Kendrick's decomposition suggests that labor productivity growth in DATE was fueled importantly by capital investment.NUM During DATE, from DATE, the growth rate of labor productivity slowed to an average pace of only NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year, with modest rates of growth both in the capital stock and in multifactor productivity. The United States then enjoyed a relatively brief spurt in productivity until DATE, with labor productivity rising about NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year and multifactor productivity up around NUM NUM/NUM percent per year. This productivity boom was led by the expansion of the automobile industry and robust productivity gains in manufacturing more generally. Productivity growth was markedly slower through the Great Depression and World War II, largely reflecting a lack of capital deepening. Multifactor productivity rose at a relatively solid pace - albeit not as fast as earlier in the century - despite the weak economy during much of that period. Productivity growth since World War II is more familiar to us and is based on more reliable data - those constructed as part of the multifactor productivity program at the BLS. According to these data, labor productivity rose at an DATE rate of close to NUM percent from DATE to DATE - a period sometimes referred to as the golden age of productivity growth. During this period, productivity accelerated across a broad range of industries, and both capital deepening and gains in multifactor productivity contributed to the strong pace of growth. The productivity slowdown of DATE and DATE is also well known to us, and its possible causes have been the subject of much research. Labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of NUM percent per year over this period, while multifactor productivity growth fell to a pace of NUM percent, the slowest pace of any of the periods shown on the table. Finally, labor productivity growth has averaged about NUM percent at an DATE rate since DATE, with higher rates of both capital deepening and multifactor productivity growth contributing to the pickup. Sources of past productivity booms: technological change Although the productivity booms of DATE obviously differed in many respects, each episode can readily be associated with the introduction of one or more new technologies. The boom after the Civil War, for instance, appears to have had its genesis in technological improvements that increased the flexibility of production and reduced transportation costs, which allowed firms to take advantage of economies of scale in production and distribution. In particular, the widespread introduction of steam engines and machinery driven by new sources of energy enabled firms to move away from sources of waterpower and closer to areas where inputs - including labor and raw materials - were more readily available. The Midwest - where sources of waterpower were less abundant but coal was more abundant - benefited greatly from this development, and indeed within DATE became known as the \"industrial heartland\" of the United States. This regional shift in economic activity is illustrated by a sharp rise in the share of personal income generated in the Midwest DATE (from NUM percent to NUM percent), and the commensurate decline in the share of income generated in the Northeast (from NUM percent to NUM percent).NUM The increase in the importance of railroad transportation also helped raise productivity growth in DATE century.NUM Improved methods of steel production - notably, the Bessemer process, and later, Siemens's open hearth method - enabled railroads to lay longer-lasting steel track rather than iron track. And the growth of telegraphy enabled railroads to better coordinate the movement of trains over a wider area. As a result, railroads expanded their geographic coverage significantly after the Civil War: From DATE, the number of main track miles operated by railroad companies more than quintupled, from NUM,NUM miles to NUM,NUM miles, while the number of freight cars in operation jumped from NUM,NUM to more than NUM million.NUM The expansion of the railroads drove transportation costs sharply lower and allowed a significant increase in market size. Whereas, in DATE, the transportation of goods from New York to Chicago had required DATE even during DATE, by DATE, it could be accomplished in DATE any time of the year.NUM In addition, the construction of new rail lines in western states opened those markets to a wide range of East Coast and Midwest manufacturers. Moreover, some of the benefits of the productivity improvements in the railroad industry were passed on to producers in the form of lower costs of transporting goods. Freight rates fell from NUM-NUM/NUM cents per ton-mile in DATE to less than NUM cent per ton-mile by DATE. As a result, the quantity of goods transported by rail increased sharply, from about NUM billion ton-miles in DATE to NUM billion ton-miles in DATE.NUM Another major technological advance in DATE was the telegraph. Besides aiding the expansion of railroads by improving the coordination of rail traffic, the telegraph sharply reduced the costs of communicating in many other industries. And judging from the rapid growth in its use - the number of messages handled rose from about NUM million in DATE to nearly NUM million in DATE - the telegraph undoubtedly contributed to better decisionmaking and higher productivity throughout the economy.NUM Agriculture also was increasingly mechanized in DATE immediately after the Civil War, though the change was not as impressive as in the industrial sector. The abundance of land in western states limited the interest among farmers in raising land productivity. However, labor services were more difficult to obtain, so farmers were quite willing to invest in labor-saving machinery. As a result, the better plows, seed drills, reapers, and threshers developed by manufacturers were in high demand by farmers, and the amount of labor required to farm an acre of land fell sharply for many crops.NUM In the productivity boom of DATE, the chief technological innovation was most likely the spread of electrification to the factory floor. As Paul David and others have extensively documented, the use of electric motors in the production process increased substantially in DATE of the century.NUM In particular, the amount of mechanical energy derived from electric motors rose from NUM,NUM horsepower in DATE to nearly NUM million horsepower in DATE, and the fraction of overall factory horsepower produced with electricity rose from less than NUM percent to more than NUM percent over that period.NUM A major benefit of electric motors was that they enabled each machine in a factory to be powered by its own motor. This allowed manufacturing plants to be organized in a way that maximized the efficient movement of materials rather than the efficient transmission of power, and it facilitated the spread of continuous processing techniques and the assembly lines made popular by Henry Ford. Indeed, as electric power became less costly - aided by a steep reduction in regulated electricity rates after World War I - its use increased sharply, and factory productivity rose significantly. By one estimate, productivity growth in the manufacturing sector as a whole rose about NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year DATE and DATE.NUM Of course, other technological innovations also contributed to productivity growth during this period. Notable among them were the telephone - which by DATE had largely replaced the telegraph; the internal combustion engine, the use of which in motorized vehicles led to sizable productivity gains in the transportation and agriculture sectors; and a variety of technological advances in machine tools. In addition, DATE were characterized by the first wave of office automation equipment, including the portable typewriter and adding and duplicating machines. These machines improved the efficiency of a wide range of management and accounting tasks, and the demand for such equipment rose quite sharply DATE. Indeed, in real terms, business investment in office equipment increased from about $NUM million (in DATE dollars) in DATE to nearly $NUM million in DATE, with a particularly large jump evident in DATE.NUM The productivity gains of DATE, in part, had their roots in the technological innovations arising out of research sponsored by the military during World War II.NUM For example, although research advances in synthetic polymerization chemistry (most notably, the introduction of catalytic cracking in the processing of crude oil) were made in DATE and DATE, the synthetic rubber program launched during the war led to mass production of the first synthetic polymer from petroleumbased feedstocks. Similarly, production of polyethylene, a petrochemical-based plastic discovered in the DATE, jumped sharply in DATE because of its widespread use in military equipment. And, the military's need for large stocks of penicillin led to a production process for it that turned out to have applicability to a wide range of pharmaceuticals. The commercialization of these wartime innovations sharply increased the number of products made wholly or partly from newly developed plastic polymers and other synthetic materials. The use of polyethylene, for example, grew sharply after the war, while additional technological advances isolated new forms of synthetics and further reduced production costs for chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Overall, production in the rubber and plastic products industry rose nearly NUM percent per year DATE, while the output of the chemical products industry rose more than NUM percent DATEly over the same period.NUM Two other notable technological advances during this period were the invention of the transistor in DATE and the use of the jet engine in commercial aircraft. Commercial applications of the transistor, initially in solid state consumer electronic products, were stimulated by improvements in the fabrication process (in DATE) and by the introduction of the integrated circuit (in DATE). With the rise in demand, semiconductor production jumped markedly, rising nearly NUM percent per year during DATE, the introduction of the Boeing NUM in DATE sharply reduced the time and cost of transporting passengers and freight. In particular, according to estimates by Gordon (DATE), productivity in the commercial airline industry rose NUM percent per year during DATE, well above the rate of labor productivity growth for the economy as a whole.NUM For purposes of comparison, the technological origins of the more recent computer revolution also bear a brief mention. Obviously, the invention of the transistor and the development of the mainframe computer were precursors of the technological advances that contributed to the current productivity boom. However, the real drivers of the productivity gains in DATE were the related high-tech innovations of DATE and DATE, including the personal computer, fiber optics, wireless communications, and the Internet. Many of the recent technological innovations have significantly altered how firms interact with their customers, in ways that have raised the productivity of the economy. In the retail sector, the Internet stores made popular by Amazon.com have been adopted by nearly all large retail chains; in banking, it is now routine for customers to pay bills online; and for airlines, Internet reservations and e-tickets are the norm. Moreover, throughout the goods economy, from manufacturing to retailing, innovations in inventory management practices made possible by new technologies have substantially reduced costs. An important point about technological change is that, in most cases, the invention of the technologies that stimulated the productivity growth in these boom periods took place well before the productivity gains were realized. For example, the steam engine was invented in DATE, well before it had any measurable effect on the production process in the United States. Similarly, railroads were being built in DATE, and the first electric power plant was built in DATE. And as we all know, the absence of a significant contribution to productivity growth from computers, which were first introduced in DATE, was a puzzle to many economists as late as DATE. What then facilitated the translation of these innovations into gains in productivity? At one level, the delay reflected the challenges of developing commercial applications for the new technologies. The lag from a new invention to a new product or process was sometimes quite long because of the additional scientific research required to demonstrate its practicality. In addition, in many cases, new technologies diffused into the capital stock relatively slowly. Replacing older machines with equipment that embodied the new technologies was often not immediately profitable, and thus firms frequently took some time before making the capital investments required to take full advantage of technological progress. Sources of past productivity booms: organizational change A careful examination of past productivity booms also points to substantial changes in business practices and in the organization of firms as a key factor enabling businesses to achieve the potential productivity gains associated with new technologies.NUM In many cases, these organizational changes went hand in hand with the technological advances - the changes both being made possible by the new technologies and being necessary to achieve the additional productivity associated with the use of these technologies. For example, before the Civil War, most businesses were either sole proprietorships or partnerships serving local markets and consisted of small shops employing skilled workers involved in each aspect of the production process. At the same time that the spread of railroads lowered transportation costs and increased the size and number of potential markets, the greater availability of steam power enabled manufacturers to set up factories to take advantage of economies of scale in production. As a result, the optimal firm size rose substantially in many industries. In the cotton industry, for example, the median firm size (measured as the DATE value of gross production in DATE dollars) rose from $NUM,NUM in DATE to nearly $NUM,NUM in DATE; similarly, in the iron industry, median firm size rose from $NUM,NUM in DATE to more than $NUM,NUM in DATE.NUM In addition, large wholesalers (and later, retailers) emerged to take advantage of increased distributional efficiencies to sharply reduce the costs of moving commodities and manufactured goods from the farm or factory to retailers' shelves. These larger enterprises typically had to confront communications challenges not faced by smaller businesses. In particular, effective internal information flows were often crucial to the success of firms producing or distributing large volumes of inputs and outputs. The telegraph and the railroad-based postal service made prompt communication over great distances possible. But firms also had to set up hierarchical management systems to control the production process and to coordinate the flow of goods across the distribution system in order to take advantage of the economies of scale presented by technological change. Advances in production processes in DATE led to new challenges and opportunities for business organization. As noted above, the diffusion of the electric motor throughout the factory increased the use of continuous-process methods and the assembly line and thus accelerated the trend toward mass production. In addition, as early as DATE, manufacturers had begun to integrate forward into distribution; one noteworthy example was the meatpacking industry, in which firms purchased refrigerated rail cars that allowed shipment of beef from centralized slaughterhouses to branch houses that served local markets. The advances in mass production techniques and the increasing complexity of many manufactured products led firms in other industries to integrate forward not only into distribution but also into retailing; this vertical integration reduced transactions costs even more and further increased the optimal size of firms. Indeed, many of the large corporations that arose at this time - Ford, General Motors, and General Electric, for example - are still with us DATE. The vertical integration of these large corporations, in turn, led to a greater emphasis on nonproduction activities.NUM To compete in retail markets, firms needed to understand what products consumers wanted and to enable consumers to associate specific products with a particular firm; in addition, firms needed to establish accounting systems to keep track of a wider range of activities. As a result, marketing and advertising departments arose within large corporations, as did accounting departments. Also, with large corporations now more sensitive to their market share and their cost advantage over their competitors, they began to develop applied research departments to foster innovations in their industries. After World War II, changes in the organization of the firm took two forms. The first was an increasing tendency by corporate managers to split the firms' operations into separate divisions, each with its own manufacturing and marketing departments. This multidivisional approach was well suited to the technological changes of DATE and DATEs, as many innovations during that period led to the manufacturing of diverse product lines by a single company, DuPont and Monsanto being key examples.NUM This multidivisional structure also turned out to be an effective method of handling corporate operations in different geographic areas; and indeed, the second major organizational innovation during this period was the rise of the multinational corporation. After World War II, new trade agreements and efforts to revitalize Europe and Japan allowed American firms to make significant inroads into foreign markets. To handle these long-distance operations more easily, corporations often set up foreign subsidiaries that could adapt quickly to changing circumstances in the host country's marketplace. By one estimate, such multinational corporations accounted for nearly NUM percent of total U.S. corporate assets by DATE.NUM Organizational structure during the productivity boom of DATE has, in some respects, shifted away from the large corporations that dominated the U.S. economy during much of DATE. To be sure, the marketplace in many industries is still dominated by large, well-established firms. And in some industries - the financial services sector comes to mind - recent technological innovations have, if anything, increased the scale of business. But in other industries, intense global competition has motivated many corporations to narrow their focus to core production-related activities and to outsource other functions. Increasingly, these supporting firms are providing their services from overseas, taking advantage both of lower labor costs there and of the revolution in communications. At the same time, much of the rapid technological innovation in this period has occurred outside the large corporate sector, and the success of that innovation has boosted the pace at which new ventures are being created. For example, more than NUM,NUM new businesses were incorporated DATE, on average, in DATE, about double the pace of DATE.NUM Of course, as we know from the dot-com experience, many of these firms failed. However, many others either grew or were bought by larger firms better able to market and distribute the most promising innovations. Sources of past productivity booms: financial market change A third major ingredient in promoting the productivity gains associated with technological innovation has been a complementary set of innovations in the financial sector that have changed the financial landscape in ways that were especially appropriate to the predominate form of business organization in each period.NUM For example, before the Civil War, most nonfinancial business investment was financed internally with retained earnings, with capital provided by family or friends, or through partnerships formed with other proprietors. The chief exceptions were the canals and railroads, which were actively issuing stocks and bonds in the DATEs.NUM With the need for greater capital investments and the sharp increases in the scale of operations of many firms after the Civil War, however, businesses in other industries also began to look more toward external sources of financing. The main sources of funding in DATE after the Civil War were debt and preferred stock.NUM Debt often took the form of secured loans, in large part because investors were concerned about the informational asymmetries they faced in evaluating the bankruptcy risk of particular firms. In addition, the owners of many firms often preferred financing with debt rather than common stock because they did not want to see their equity diluted or their control of the enterprise diminished. Similarly, preferred stock, which reduced bankruptcy risk but did not dilute the equity of the owners of the firm, was often used when assets were insufficient to secure the loan. Thus, despite the prevalence of information problems, financial intermediaries were able to provide firms with external sources of funds, making possible the rapid buildup in the capital stock that took place in DATE. For example, the total value of bank loans rose from less than $NUM billion in DATE to more than $NUM billion in the early DATEs, a notable increase in nominal value during a time when, if anything, the aggregate price level was falling.NUM In contrast, DATE after World War I were characterized by an increase in the importance of equity markets. At the New York Stock Exchange alone, the volume of stock sales rose from NUM million shares in DATE to more than NUM billion shares in DATE.NUM And, by one estimate, the number of individuals holding stock increased from NUM,NUM in DATE to NUM million by DATE.NUM The rise in the public's interest in common stock occurred for several reasons. First, and probably most importantly, the profitability of large corporations during DATE was accompanied by an expanding middle and upper class that wanted to take part in the economic gains associated with the introduction of new technologies such as the internal combustion engine and the electric motor. As the main way to share in these capital gains was to purchase some ownership in those corporations, these individuals increasingly looked to invest their savings in the stock market. At about the same time, the informational problems that had constrained interest in common stock through DATE were being reduced. Rising demand from investors in DATE for information about railroad companies had led to the proliferation of newsletters watching developments in that industry, and similar publications soon sprang up to provide information on other traded securities. These newsletters eventually evolved into ratings agencies covering a wide range of individual corporations, with Moody's issuing the first bond ratings in DATE. Although these agencies' ratings focused on corporate bond issues, many also provided economic forecasting services and more detailed information about the relative risk of specific companies. In addition, with a greater recognition of the need to address investors' concerns about risk, more public companies regularly issued audited financial statements.NUM Interest in common stock was also boosted by the tendency to imbue them with characteristics similar to those associated with debt, with which investors were more familiar. For example, businesses frequently attempted to establish steady dividend streams in order to boost investors' confidence about the future profitability of the firm and encourage holdings of their securities. Finally, the marketing of securities to the household sector became more aggressive in DATE, led by investment trusts - which offered investors a means of diversifying individual portfolios - and retail brokerage firms. Given the relative prosperity of the post-World War II period, nonfinancial corporations were able to generate significant increases in internal funds. Even so, the growth of investment spending over this period noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the capital markets to fill the widening gap. In response, both bond and equity issuance rose rapidly in absolute terms, and the ratio of external financing to overall capital spending increased from an average of around NUM percent in DATE to more than NUM percent in DATE There were two specific developments in financial markets during this period that bear mentioning. First, DATE and DATE saw the rise of the Eurodollar",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Fedspeak Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    There was a time when central bankers did not talk to the public. Montagu Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England for DATE after the First World War and a highly influential figure in his time in central banking circles, was notorious for his reclusiveness, both personal and professional. According to his biographer, Norman lived by the maxim, \"Never explain, never excuse\" (Boyle, DATE, p. NUM). Norman was hardly unique. Central bankers long believed that a certain \"mystique\" attached to their activities; that making monetary policy was an arcane and esoteric art that should be left solely to the initiates; and that letting the public into the discussion would only usurp the prerogatives of insiders and degrade the effectiveness of policy. In contrast to this tradition of secrecy, central banks around the world have become noticeably more open and transparent over DATE. Policymaking committees have adopted various mechanisms to enhance their communication with the public, including more informative policy announcements, post-meeting press conferences, expanded testimony before the legislature, the release of the minutes of policy meetings, and the regular publication of reports on monetary policy and the economy. This increased openness is a welcome development, for many reasons. Perhaps most important, as public servants whose policy actions affect the lives of every citizen, central bankers have a basic responsibility to give the public full and compelling explanations of the rationales for those actions. Besides satisfying the principle of democratic accountability, a more open policymaking process is also likely to lead to better policy decisions, because engagement with an informed public provides central bankers with useful feedback in the form of outside views and analyses. Yet another benefit of full and timely release of information about policy decisions and their rationales is a reduced risk that market-sensitive information will dribble out through inappropriate channels, giving unfair advantage to some financial market participants. Admittedly, for many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, progress toward greater transparency has come in halting steps and not without trepidation. For example, the decision to announce changes in the target for the federal funds rate immediately after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was implemented only in phases and after considerable soulsearching by FOMC members. In retrospect, however, I think that most central bankers, both in the United States and abroad, would agree that greater openness has been beneficial to central banks as institutions and for the advancement of their policy objectives. Although the presumption DATE is that - absent compelling reasons to the contrary - central banks should strive for transparency, some basic questions about what, how, and to what end central banks should communicate with the public remain decidedly open. In my talk DATE I will put aside broader considerations such as democratic accountability and consider these questions as they bear on the ability of central banks to make monetary policy more effective and to improve macroeconomic performance. Before proceeding, I should emphasize that the views I will express DATE are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Why central bank communication matters for policy effectiveness Can central bank talk - Fedspeak, in the vernacular of the U.S. media and financial markets - make monetary policy more effective and improve economic outcomes? To see why communication may be an integral part of good monetary policymaking, recall that the Federal Reserve directly controls only a single short-term interest rate, the overnight federal funds rate. Relative to the enormous size of global financial markets, the market for federal funds - the market in which commercial banks borrow and lend reserves on a short-term basis - is insignificant. Control of the federal funds rate is therefore useful only to the extent that it can be used as a lever to influence more important asset prices and yields - stock prices, government and corporate bond yields, mortgage rates - which in turn allow the Fed to affect the overall course of the economy. Of course, basic financial theory implies that a link does exist between short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate, and longer-term rates, such as Treasury bond yields and mortgage rates. In particular, longer-term yields should depend in part on market expectations about the future course of short-term rates. For example, with the current setting of the funds rate held constant, any arriving news that leads bond market participants to expect higher future values of the funds rate will tend to raise bond yields and lower bond prices. The link between long-term bond yields and market expectations of future monetary policy actions is familiar to all financial-market participants and has been well supported by recent empirical research. For example, Antulio Bomfim has demonstrated that the shape of the term structure of Treasury yields can be effectively described by a two-factor model, in which the first factor corresponds to the current setting of the funds rate and the second factor closely approximates medium-term monetary policy expectations (Bomfim, DATE). The fact that market expectations of future settings of the federal funds rate are at least as important as the current value of the funds rate in determining key interest rates such as bond and mortgage rates suggests a potentially important role for central bank communication: If effective communication can help financial markets develop more accurate expectations of the likely future course of the funds rate, policy will be more effective (in a precise sense that I will explain further soon), and risk in financial markets should be reduced as well. It is worth emphasizing that the predictability of monetary policy actions has both short-run and long-run aspects. A central bank may, through various means, improve the market's ability to anticipate its next policy move. Improving short-term predictability is not unimportant, because it may reduce risk premiums in asset markets and influence shorter-term yields. But signaling the likely action at the next meeting is not sufficient for effective policymaking. Because the values of long-term assets are affected by the whole trajectory of expected short-term rates, it is even more vital that information relevant to estimating that trajectory be communicated. As I will argue later, this can usually be done only by providing information about the central bank's objectives, assessment of the economy, and policy strategy. Communication, asymmetric information and learning Ideally, what should central bank communication try to achieve? In an important analysis of the issue of central bank transparency, my FOMC colleague William Poole laid out a benchmark case in which the potential benefits of communication would be fully realized (Poole, DATE). In this benchmark case, the central bank has well-defined objectives and pursues regular and systematic policies consistent with those objectives. More important for our purposes, in this idealized world, financial markets are highly efficient and well informed. In particular, financial-market participants have access to all the information that the central bank uses in making policy decisions. Let us call the premise that the central bank has no significant information advantage over the private sector the assumption of symmetric information. If the conditions of systematic policymaking, financial-market efficiency, and symmetric information all held, then one might hope that the economy would converge to a rational expectations equilibrium, in which participants in financial markets would need only to analyze incoming, publicly available economic data to make efficient forecasts of future Federal Reserve actions.NUM In this benchmark case, there would be no marginal benefit to central bank communication, beyond whatever was necessary to support this equilibrium in the first place. Of course, to describe this idealized benchmark case is to recognize that it is at best an approximate not description of the economy in which we live. In practice, financial-market participants generally do have as much information as monetary policymakers do about a number of key inputs to policymaking, including the policymakers' own objectives, their (possibly implicit) model of the economy and the monetary transmission mechanism, their assessment of the economic situation (including both asymmetry of forecasts and the risks to the forecast), and their policy strategy. To the extent that this information between the central bank and the financial markets is quantitatively important - and I will present some evidence on this point shortly - financial markets will not price bonds and other assets efficiently (relative to the information possessed by the central bank), and scope may exist for central bank communication to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy and the overall performance of the economy. A skeptic might argue that noise and other sources of pricing inefficiency pervade the financial markets, so that improving the predictability of monetary policy is of limited importance in practice, except perhaps to a few brokers and traders. To the contrary, there is good reason to believe that information asymmetries between the central bank and financial markets may matter a great deal for economic welfare. A theoretical basis for this view is provided by the lively recent literature on adaptive learning and monetary policy. This work has shown that, when the public does not know but instead must estimate the central bank's reaction function and other economic relationships using observed data, we have no guarantee that the economy will converge - even in infinite time - to the optimal itself rational expectations equilibrium.NUM In general, the problem is that the public's learning process affects the behavior of the economy - for example, as when expectational errors by bond traders affect interest rates and thus a wide range of economic decisions. The feedback effect of learning on the economy, this literature has shown, can in principle lead to unstable or indeterminate outcomes. More generally, the dynamic behavior of an economy with asymmetric information and learning may be radically different from the behavior of the same economy in the optimal rational expectations equilibrium. A particularly interesting analysis of the implications of learning for monetary policy and central bank communication has been provided in a series of papers by Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (DATEa, DATEb). Orphanides and Williams study model economies in which the public is assumed to know the general nature of the economy's underlying structure but not the precise quantitative magnitudes describing that structure. Specifically, these authors consider a model in which the public is assumed to know the form of the equation describing the dynamic behavior of inflation but not the parameters of that equation, which depend on the (unobserved by the public) objectives and preferences of the central bank. Orphanides and Williams assume that, to learn the parameters of the process that generates inflation, people must apply standard statistical methods to observed data on inflation and other macroeconomic variables. Obviously, in assuming that people know the true economic structure with certainty, and that they infer the underlying parameters of that structure using formal statistical methods, Orphanides and Williams and others in this literature are attributing much greater knowledge and sophistication to the public than exist in the real world. Nevertheless, the behavior of their model economies with learning can be quite different from that of the rational expectations analogue, in which the public is assumed to have full and symmetric information. For example, these authors show that the economy with learning is prone to episodes of stagflation, or combinations of high inflation and low output. The logic is as follows: When people are learning about the inflation process, an increase in inflation that would be only temporary and would leave expectations unaffected in a rational expectations world, may instead lead the public to infer that the long-run average rate of inflation is higher than previously thought. The rise in the public's inflation expectations affects wage- and price-setting and other economic decisions and thus raises actual inflation. In a vicious cycle, the higher rate of realized inflation further increases inflation expectations, forcing the central bank to tighten policy. The result is inflation that is unnecessarily high and output that is unnecessarily low. Several insights come from this and other contributions to the literature on adaptive learning in macroeconomics. First, the fact that the public must learn about underlying economic relationships changes the nature of the optimal monetary policy. In general, with learning, the central bank's optimal policy involves exerting a tighter control on inflation than it might otherwise exert, to avoid the possibility that inflation expectations will drift randomly higher (or lower). Thus, this approach formalizes the idea that a central bank should work actively to \"anchor\" inflation expectations within a narrow range. Second, efficient policy in this world requires that policymakers pay attention to information (for example, from surveys) about the public's expectations of inflation and other variables; if these appear not to be converging toward the desired levels, then a policy response may be warranted.NUM Finally, and most important for my purpose DATE, communication by the central bank may play a key role in helping improve economic performance. For example, in the models analyzed by Orphanides and Williams, the provision of information by the central bank about its long-run inflation objective or its economic forecasts generally leads to more favorable policy tradeoffs and better economic outcomes. The work on adaptive learning by Orphanides and Williams and others is largely theoretical, but in my view it is highly relevant to understanding modern U.S. monetary history. A leading example is the stagflationary period of DATE, in which astute observers recognized that high and unstable public expectations of inflation, themselves generated by poor macroeconomic policies that allowed inflation to get out of control, greatly increased the complexity and cost of restoring stability.NUM More recently, Marvin Goodfriend (DATE) has identified several instances of what he calls \"inflation scares,\" apparently autonomous increases in inflation expectations that raised long-term bond yields and forced a tightening of monetary policy that could have been avoided if expectations had been better anchored. The view that adaptive learning and asymmetric information are crucial to understanding recent monetary history is apparently shared by the developers of the Federal Reserve's primary econometric model, the FRBUS model, which relies heavily on these assumptions (Brayton et al., DATE). Simulations of that model suggest both that adaptive learning is needed to explain the observed responses of the financial market and the economy to monetary policy actions, and that asymmetric information and adaptive learning lead systematically to inferior macroeconomic outcomes, as implied by the work of Orphanides and Williams and others. Of course, the situation in the United States is much better DATE than in DATE; both inflation and inflation expectations are much more stable, and better economic outcomes have been the result. But is there still scope for improvement? I will present some evidence to suggest that there is and then conclude by discussing how communications policies could help anchor and stabilize the system more firmly. Evidence on the effectiveness of Fed communication In DATE, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of significant steps toward increased transparency, including announcing decisions about the federal funds rate promptly after FOMC meetings, indicating first a policy \"bias\" and then a \"balance of risks\" assessment in post-meeting statements, and making the minutes of policy meetings publicly available (with a lag of DATE). Members of the FOMC have also made greater use of vehicles such as testimony and speeches to convey their assessments of the economy and their policy inclinations to the public. How effective have these efforts been? I earlier distinguished between short-run and long-run predictability of policy. Fairly strong evidence supports the conclusion that the short-run predictability of policy has increased in DATE. For example, Joe Lange, Brian Sack, and William Whitesell (DATE) have shown that, since DATE and DATE, monetary policy actions over short horizons have been predicted increasingly well by financial instruments such as three- and DATE Treasury bills and federal funds futures contracts. These authors attribute at least part of this improvement to greater transparency on the part of the Federal Reserve. Poole, Rasche, and Thornton (DATE) reach a similar conclusion.NUM However, the more important question is whether the Federal Reserve has improved the ability of the public to forecast its policies at long horizons. Long-horizon forecastability of policy has a number of dimensions, of course. One that has received particular attention in the literature, and which is closely related to theoretical models that assume adaptive learning, is the question of whether the public is able to infer the Federal Reserve's implicit long-run inflation objective.NUM Uncertainty about this objective bears directly on the market's ability to price long-term assets, as well as on the capacity of wage- and price-setters to strike efficient long-term agreements and of firms and households to make long-term economic plans. Various types of evidence bear on this question. For example, some recent research has considered expectations of inflation and other variables as measured by surveys. One clear finding is that, as inflation has come under control and has stabilized in the United States in DATE, long-term inflation expectations have stabilized as well, suggesting reduced uncertainty about the Fed's ultimate inflation objective. For example, a cross-country study of inflation expectations by staff of the European Central Bank found that, since DATE, both the average level of expected inflation and the volatility of reported expectations of inflation in the United States have declined, the latter quite significantly (especially since NUM).NUM However, as an aside, it is interesting that both surveys and the inflation compensation priced into the yields on indexed bonds suggest that DATE long-term inflation expectations in the United States remain in the vicinity of NUM-NUM/NUM to NUM percent, above the range of inflation that many observers believe to represent the FOMC's implicit target. Possibly, this observation indicates an ongoing process of adaptive learning. A subtler issue is the degree to which inflation expectations in the United States are anchored. Specifically, to what extent would inflation expectations rise if actual inflation increased for some reason? To address this question, Andrew Levin, Fabio Natalucci, and Jeremy Piger (DATE) examined U.S. private-sector forecasts of inflation since DATE. They found that medium- and long-term forecasts of inflation in the United States are strongly correlated with DATE moving average of lagged inflation, a finding that suggests that inflation expectations are not entirely anchored but are instead subject to adaptive learning. As a supporting piece of evidence, Levin, Natalucci, and Piger show that, compared to other industrial countries, shocks to inflation tend to be relatively persistent in the United States, an implication of models with adaptive learning.NUM Bond markets provide fertile ground in which to search for evidence on the importance of adaptive learning and the degree to which expectations are well anchored. For example, Refet Gurkaynak, Brian Sack, and Eric Swanson (DATE) show that distant forward rates (e.g., the implied DATE forward rate DATE in the future) move significantly in response to the unexpected components of both monetary policy decisions and a number of macroeconomic data releases. Because they do not find the same result for inflation-indexed securities (that is, real forward rates do not respond to policy or data surprises), they conclude that long-term expectations of inflation must not be tightly anchored in the United States. Kevin Kliesen and Frank Schmid (DATE) support these findings by showing directly that DATE inflation expectations, as derived from inflation-indexed bonds, respond significantly to policy surprises as well as to the unexpected components of macroeconomic data releases.NUM Interesting work by Sharon Kozicki and Peter Tinsley (DATE, DATE) bears directly on the importance of asymmetric information and learning in financial markets. Kozicki and Tinsley incorporate alternative specifications of the evolution of inflation expectations in a standard model of the term structure (see Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay, DATE). Kozicki and Tinsley show that by far the best fit is obtained when inflation expectations are modeled as evolving by adaptive learning, in which inflation expectations adjust slowly to actual inflation. When inflation expectations are modeled this way, and only when they are modeled this way, the expectations theory of the term structure performs well and estimated term premiums are relatively small. In related research, Glenn Rudebusch and Tao Wu (DATE) show empirically that a two-factor model of the term structure can be closely linked to monetary policy fundamentals, but only on the assumption that the medium-term inflation expectations held by market participants are time-varying. All the cited findings apply to recent data, as well to earlier observations. The evidence for asymmetric information and adaptive learning, at least in regard to the Fed's inflation objective, thus seems quite strong. Implications for central bank communication So far I have discussed why central bank communication is important for financial market efficiency and good macroeconomic performance, and I have presented a few pieces of evidence that suggest that asymmetry of information between the Federal Reserve and the public may be an important phenomenon. What implications does all this have for the communication policies of the Fed? In an ideal world, the Federal Reserve would release to the public a complete specification of its policy rule, relating the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate to current and expected economic conditions, as well as its economic models, data, and forecasts. Using this information, financial-market participants would be able to forecast future values of the policy rate and efficiently price long-term bonds and other assets. Unfortunately, as stressed by Poole (DATE) as well as by Chairman Greenspan (DATE) in his talk at the most recent Jackson Hole conference, specifying a complete and explicit policy rule, from which the central bank would never deviate under any circumstances, is impractical. The problem is that the number of contingencies to which policy might respond is effectively infinite (and, indeed, many are unforeseeable). While specifying a complete policy rule is infeasible, however, there is much that a central bank can do - both by its actions and its words - to improve the ability of financial markets to predict monetary policy actions. With respect to actions, the central bank should behave in as systematic and as understandable a way as possible, given the macroeconomic and financial environment. That is, although monetary policy cannot be made by a mechanical rule, policy can and should have \"rule-like\" features. Obviously, the more systematic and the more consistent with a few basic principles the conduct of monetary policy becomes, the easier it will be for the public to understand and predict the Fed's behavior.NUM However, because the world is complex and ever changing, policy actions alone, without explanation, will never be enough to provide the public with the information it needs to predict policy actions. Words are also necessary. What then should the Fed talk about? In general, the research I have discussed DATE suggests that the central bank should do what it can to make information symmetric, providing the public to the extent possible with the same information that the FOMC uses in making its DATE More specifically, the strongest implication of the adaptive learning literature is that the Fed should be as explicit as possible about its policy objectives. Without clear information about policy objectives, the public's problem of predicting future monetary policy actions becomes extremely difficult. For example, without this information, it would be hard for the public to know whether an unexpected policy move signals a change in the policymakers' objectives, a change in their economic outlook, or both. As also suggested by the adaptive learning literature, a potential advantage of having an explicit objective for inflation in particular is that it may help to anchor the public's expectations.NUM Besides its policy objectives, the central bank can make other useful information available to the public, including its economic forecasts, its assessment of the economic risks, and (if possible) the models or analytical frameworks that underlie its diagnosis of the economy. The Federal Reserve currently provides information on each of these elements. For example, the so-called \"central tendency\" forecasts of the FOMC are released DATE, as part of the Chairman's DATE testimony before Congress; the statements following FOMC meetings provide some assessment of the perceived risks to the forecast; and the active research programs conducted at the Board and the Reserve banks, including publications and conferences, provide observers insights into the underlying analytical frameworks that inform monetary policymaking. We should continue to seek improvement in each of these areas. For example, FOMC forecasts might be released more frequently and for a longer horizon. Additional variables could be forecasted, notably core inflation, a key factor in FOMC policy decisions. More controversially, the FOMC might consider forecasting future values of the short-term interest rate, as is currently done by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The difficulty would be to make clear that an interest-rate forecast is not the same as a policy commitment. The use of \"fan charts\" to indicate the range of uncertainty would be helpful in this regard; and indeed, providing more information about the range of uncertainty for all FOMC forecasts would be a useful innovation. In my talk DATE I have often adopted the common convention of speaking of the central bank as if it were a single actor. In reality, policymaking at most central banks is done by a committee. In the United States, nineteen people (twelve of whom get to vote at any given meeting) have seats at the FOMC table. The diversity of views and opinions likely to exist among the members of a large committee create further challenges for effective communication. However, vehicles do exist to help convey the breadth of opinion on the Committee. For example, the minutes of FOMC meetings describe the range of viewpoints and many of the key considerations underlying policy decisions. In my view, releasing TIME more promptly than is now done would provide useful and more timely information for the public. Although at times it feels cacophonous, the willingness of FOMC members to present their individual perspectives in speeches and other public forums provides the public with useful information about the diversity of views and the balance of opinion on the Committee. Other possibilities for improved transparency may exist. Importantly, as we think about these, we should not simply take the view that more information is always better. Indeed, irrelevant or badly communicated information may create more noise than signal; and some types of information provision - an extreme example would be televising FOMC meetings - risk compromising the integrity and quality of the policymaking process itself. Rather, the key question should be whether the additional information will improve the public's understanding of the Fed's objectives, economic assessments, and analytical framework, thus allowing them to make better inferences about how monetary policy is likely to respond to future developments in the economy. Communication that meets this criterion will lead to better monetary policy and better economic performance.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Conducting monetary policy at very low short-term interest rates Lecture by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, and Mr Vincent R Reinhart, Director, Division of Monetary Affairs of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System1, at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies, Geneva, DATE. Paper also presented at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    Can monetary policy committees, accustomed to describing their plans and actions in terms of the level of a short-term nominal interest rate, find effective means of conducting and communicating their policies when that rate is zero or close to zero? The very low levels of interest rates in Japan, Switzerland, and the United States in DATE have stimulated much interesting research on this question, and some has been applied in the field. Moreover, their minds concentrated by the possibility of having the policy rate pinned at zero, central bankers have responded flexibly, making changes in their operating procedures and communications strategies. Our purpose in this paper is to give a brief progress report and overview of current thinking on the conduct of monetary policy when short-term interest rates are very low or even zero.NUM Monetary policy works for the most part through financial markets. Central bank actions are designed in the first instance to influence asset prices and yields, which in turn affect economic decisions and thus the evolution of the economy. When the short-term policy rate is at or near zero, the conventional means of effecting monetary ease--lowering the target for the policy rate--is no longer feasible, but monetary policy is not impotent. In this paper we will discuss three alternative (but potentially complementary) monetary strategies for stimulating the economy that do not involve changing the current value of the policy rate. Specifically, these alternatives involve (NUM) providing assurance to financial investors that short rates will be lower in the future than they currently expect, (NUM) changing the relative supplies of securities (such as Treasury notes and bonds) in the marketplace by shifting the composition of the central bank's balance sheet, and (NUM) increasing the size of the central bank's balance sheet beyond the level needed to set the short-term policy rate at zero (\"quantitative easing\"). In the final section, we briefly discuss the macroeconomic costs and benefits of very low interest rates, an issue that bears on the question of whether the central bank should take the policy rate all the way to zero before undertaking some of the alternatives we describe. I. Shaping Interest-Rate Expectations The pricing of long-lived assets, such as long-term bonds and equities, depends on the entire expected future path of short-term interest rates as well as on the current short-term rate. Prices and yields of long-lived assets are important determinants of economic behavior because they affect incentives to spend, save, and invest. Thus, a central bank may hope to affect financial markets and economic activity by influencing financial market participants' expectations of future short-term rates. Important recent research has examined this potential channel of influence in fully articulated models based on optimizing behavior; see Michael Woodford (DATE, chapter NUM), Lars Svensson (DATE), and Gauti Eggertson and Woodford (DATE). This literature suggests that, even with the TIME nominal interest rate at zero, a central bank can impart additional stimulus by offering some form of commitment to the public to keep the short rate low for a longer period than previously expected. This commitment, if credible, should lower yields throughout the term structure and support other asset prices. In principle, the central bank's policy commitment could take either of two forms: unconditional and conditional. An unconditional commitment is a pledge by the central bank to hold short-term rates at a low level for a fixed period of calendar time. In this case, additional easing would take the form of lengthening the period of policy commitment. However, given the many shocks that the economy is heir to, as well as other imponderables that affect the outlook, a policymaking committee might understandably be reluctant to tie its hands by making an unconditional promise, no matter how nuanced, about policy actions far into the future. An alternative strategy is to make a conditional policy commitment, one that links the duration of promised policies not to the calendar but to the evolution of economic conditions. For example, policy ease could be promised until the committee observes sustained economic growth, substantial progress in trimming economic slack, or a period of inflation above a specified floor. In practice, central banks appear to appreciate the importance of influencing market expectations about future policy. For example, in May DATE, with its policy rate virtually at zero, the Bank of Japan promised that it would keep its policy rate at zero for as long as the economy experienced deflation--a conditional policy commitment. More recently, the Bank of Japan has been more explicit about the conditions under which it would begin to raise rates; for example, it has been specified that a change from deflation to inflation that is perceived to be temporary will not provoke a tightening.NUM In the United States, the August DATE statement of the Federal Open Market Committee that \"policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period\" is another example of commitment. The close association of this statement with the Committee's expressed concerns about \"unwelcome disinflation\" implied that this commitment was conditioned on the assessment of the economy. The conditional nature of the commitment was sharpened in the Committee's DATE statement, which explicitly linked continuing policy accommodation to the low level of inflation and the slack in resource use.NUM More generally, in DATE central banks have devoted enormous effort to improving their communications and transparency; a major benefit of such efforts should be a greater ability to align market expectations of policy with the policymaking committee's own intentions. Of course, policy commitments can influence future expectations only to the extent that they are credible. Various devices might be employed to enhance credibility; for example, the central bank can make securities purchases or issue financial options that make it quite costly, in financial terms, to renege on its commitments (Clouse et al., DATE). An objection to this strategy is that it is not entirely clear why a central bank, which has the power to print money, should be overly concerned about its financial gains and losses. Eggertsson and Woodford (DATE) point out that a government can more credibly promise to carry out policies that raise prices when (NUM) the government debt is large and not indexed to inflation and (NUM) the central bank values the reduction in fiscal burden that reflationary policies will bring (for example, because it may reduce the future level of distortionary taxation). Ultimately, however, the central bank's best strategy for building credibility is to ensure that its deeds match its words, thereby building trust in its pronouncements. The requirement that deeds match words has the consequence that the shaping of market expectations is not an independent instrument of policy in the long run. II. Altering the Composition of the Central Bank's Balance Sheet Central banks typically hold a variety of assets, and the composition of assets on the central bank's balance sheet offers another potential lever for monetary policy. For example, the Federal Reserve participates in all segments of the Treasury market, with most of its current asset holdings of about $NUM billion distributed among Treasury securities with maturities ranging from DATE to DATE. Over DATE, the average maturity of the Federal Reserve System's holdings of Treasury debt has varied considerably within a range from DATE. As an important participant in the Treasury market, the Federal Reserve might be able to influence term premiums, and thus overall yields, by shifting the composition of its holdings, say from shorter- to longer-dated securities. In simple terms, if the liquidity or risk characteristics of securities differ, so that investors do not treat all securities as perfect substitutes, then changes in relative demands by a large purchaser have the potential to alter relative security prices. (The same logic might lead the central bank to consider purchasing assets other than Treasury securities, such as corporate bonds or stocks or foreign government bonds. The Federal Reserve is currently authorized to purchase some foreign government bonds but not most private-sector assets, such as corporate bonds or stocks.) Perhaps the most extreme example of a policy keyed to the composition of the central bank's balance sheet is an announced ceiling on some longer-term yield below the prevailing rate. This policy entails (in principle) an unlimited commitment to purchase the targeted security at the announced price. (To keep the overall size of its balance sheet unchanged, the central bank would have to sell other securities in an amount equal to the purchases of the targeted security.) Obviously, such a policy would signal strong dissatisfaction on the part of the policymaking committee with current market expectations of future policy rates. Whether policies based on manipulating the composition of the central bank balance sheet can be effective is a contentious issue. The limited empirical evidence generally suggests that the degree of imperfect substitutability within broad asset classes, such as Treasury securities, is not great, so that changes in relative supplies within the range of U.S. experience are unlikely to have a major impact on risk premiums or term premiums (Reinhart and Sack, DATE). If this view is correct, then attempts to enforce a floor on the prices of long-dated Treasury securities (for example) could be effective only if the target prices were broadly consistent with investor expectations of future values of the policy rate. If investors doubted that rates would be kept low, the central bank would end up owning all or most of those securities. Moreover, even if large purchases of, say, a long-dated Treasury security were able to affect the yield on that security, the policy may not have significant economic effects if the targeted security became \"disconnected\" from the rest of the term structure and from private rates, such as mortgage rates. Yet another complication affecting this type of policy is that the central bank's actions would have to be coordinated with the central government's finance department to ensure that changes in debtmanagement policies do not offset the attempts of the central bank to affect the relative supplies of securities. According to James Tobin, the Federal Reserve's failure to coordinate adequately with the Treasury was the undoing of \"Operation Twist\" in DATE (Tobin, DATE, pp. NUM-NUM). Despite these objections, we should not fail to note that policies based on changing the composition of the central bank's balance sheet have been tried in the United States. From DATE, the Federal Reserve enforced rate ceilings at two and sometimes three points on the Treasury yield curve. This objective was accomplished with only moderate increases in the Federal Reserve's overall holdings of Treasury securities, relative to net debt outstanding; moreover, there is little evidence that the targeted yields became \"disconnected\" from other public or private yields. The episode is an intriguing one, but unfortunately the implications for current policy are not entirely straightforward. We know that, by DATE, the Federal Reserve System owned almost nine-tenths of the (relatively small) stock of Treasury bills, suggesting that at the short end, the ceiling on the bill rate was a binding constraint. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's relative holdings of longer-dated Treasury notes and bonds fell over the period, although the rate ceilings at these longer maturities were not breached until inflation pressures led to the Fed-Treasury Accord and the abandonment of the pegging policy in DATE. The conventional interpretation is that long-run policy expectations must have been consistent with the ceilings at the more distant points on the yield curve. Less clear is the extent to which the pegging policy itself influenced those policy expectations. Probably the safest conclusion about policies based on changing the composition of the central bank's balance sheet is that they should be used only to supplement other policies, such as an attempt (for example, through a policy commitment) to influence expectations of future short rates. This combined approach allows the central bank to enjoy whatever benefits arise from changing the relative supplies of outstanding securities without risking the problems that may arise if the yields desired by the central bank are inconsistent with market expectations. III. Expanding the Size of the Central Bank's Balance Sheet Besides changing the composition of its balance sheet, the central bank can also alter policy by changing the size of its balance sheet; that is, by buying or selling securities to affect the overall supply of reserves and the money stock. Of course, this strategy represents the conventional means of conducting monetary policy, as described in many textbooks. DATE, most central banks choose to calibrate the degree of policy ease or tightness by targeting the price of reserves--in the case of the Federal Reserve, the TIME federal funds rate. However, nothing prevents a central bank from switching its focus from the price of reserves to the quantity or growth of reserves. When stated in terms of quantities, it becomes apparent that even if the price of reserves (the federal funds rate) becomes pinned at zero, the central bank can still expand the quantity of reserves. That is, reserves can be increased beyond the level required to hold the TIME rate at zero--a policy sometimes referred to as \"quantitative easing.\" Some evidence exists that quantitative easing can stimulate the economy even when interest rates are near zero; see, for example, Christina Romer's (DATE) discussion of the effects of increases in the money supply during the Great Depression in the United States. Quantitative easing may affect the economy through several possible channels. One potential channel is based on the premise that money is an imperfect substitute for other financial assets (in contrast to the view discussed in the previous section that emphasizes the imperfect substitutability of various nonmoney assets). If this premise holds, then large increases in the money supply will lead investors to seek to rebalance their portfolios, raising prices and reducing yields on alternative, non-money assets. Lower yields on long-term assets will in turn stimulate economic activity. The possibility that monetary policy works through portfolio substitution effects, even in normal times, has a long intellectual history, having been espoused by both Keynesians (Tobin, DATE) and monetarists (Brunner and Meltzer, DATE). Recently, Javier Andres, J. David Lopez-Salido, and Edward Nelson (DATE) have shown how these effects might work in a general equilibrium model with optimizing agents. The practical importance of these effects remains an open question, however. Quantitative easing may also work by altering expectations of the future path of policy rates. For example, suppose that the central bank commits itself to keeping reserves at a high level, well above that needed to ensure a zero short-term interest rate, until certain economic conditions obtain. Theoretically, this action is equivalent to a commitment to keep interest rates at zero until the economic conditions are met, a type of policy we have already discussed. However, the act of setting and meeting a high reserves target is more visible, and hence may be more credible, than a purely verbal promise about future short-term interest rates. Moreover, this means of committing to a zero interest rate will also achieve any benefits of quantitative easing that may be felt through nonexpectational channels. Lastly, quantitative easing that is sufficiently aggressive and that is perceived to be long-lived may have expansionary fiscal effects. So long as market participants expect a positive short-term interest rate at some date in the future, the existence of government debt implies a current or future tax liability for the public. In expanding its balance sheet by open-market purchases, the central bank replaces public holdings of interest-bearing government debt with non-interest-bearing currency or reserves. If the open-market operation is not expected to be reversed too quickly, this exchange reduces the present and future interest costs of the government and the tax burden on the public. (Effectively, this process replaces a direct tax, say on labor, with the inflation tax.) Auerbach and Obstfeld (DATE) have analyzed the fiscal and expectational effects of a permanent increase in the money supply along these lines. Note that the expectational and fiscal channels of quantitative easing, though not the portfolio substitution channel, require the central bank to make a credible commitment to not reverse its openmarket operations, at least until certain conditions are met. Thus, this approach also poses communication challenges for monetary policy makers. Japan once again provides the most recent case study. In DATE, current account balances held by commercial banks at the Bank of Japan have increased about five-fold, and the monetary base has risen to almost NUM percent of nominal GDP. While deflation appears to have eased in Japan recently, it is difficult to know how much of the improvement is due to monetary policy, and, of the part due to monetary policy, how much is due to the zero-interest-rate policy and how much to quantitative easing. The experience of the United States with quantitative policies is limited to DATE, when the Federal Reserve targeted nonborrowed reserves. Of course, nominal interest rates were not close to zero at that time. The U.S. experience does suggest, however, that the demand for reserves may be sufficiently erratic that the effects of quantitative policies may be intrinsically hard to calibrate. IV. Sequencing and the \"Costs\" of Low Interest Rates The forms of monetary stimulus described above can be used once the TIME rate has already been driven to zero or as a way of driving the TIME rate to zero. However, a central bank might choose to rely on these alternative policies while maintaining the TIME rate somewhat above zero. For example, monetary policy makers might attempt to influence market expectations of future short rates as an alternative to changing the current setting of the TIME rate. Another possibility is to try to affect term premiums, expectations of future rates, or both, by changing the composition of securities held by the central bank. (Unlimited expansion of the total volume of securities held by the central bank is not compatible, of course, with a positive TIME rate.) The appropriate sequencing of policy actions depends on the perceived costs associated with very low or zero TIME interest rates, as well as on operational considerations and estimates of the likely effects of alternative combinations of policies on the economy. What costs are imposed on society by very low short-term interest rates? Observers have pointed out that rates on financial instruments typically priced below the TIME rate, such as liquid deposits, shares in money market mutual funds, and collateralized borrowings in the \"repo\" market, would be squeezed toward zero as the policy rate fell, prompting investors to seek alternatives. Short-term dislocations might result, for example, if funds flowed in large amounts from money market mutual funds into bank deposits. In that case, some commercial paper issuers who have traditionally relied on money market mutual funds for financing would have to seek out new sources, while banks would need to find productive uses for the deposit inflows and perhaps face changes in regulatory capital requirements. In addition, liquidity in some markets might be affected; for example, the incentive for reserve managers to trade federal funds diminishes as the TIME rate falls, probably thinning brokering in that market. In thinking about the costs associated with a low TIME rate, one should bear in mind the message of Milton Friedman's classic essay on the optimal quantity of money (Friedman, DATE). Friedman argued that an TIME interest rate of zero is optimal, because a zero opportunity cost of liquidity eliminates the socially wasteful use of resources to economize on money balances. From this perspective, the costs of low short-term interest rates can be seen largely as adjustment costs, arising from the unwinding of schemes designed to make holding transactions balances less burdensome. These costs are real but are also largely transitory and have limited sectoral impact. Moreover, to the extent that the affected institutions have economic functions other than helping clients economize on money balances (for example, if some money market mutual funds have a comparative advantage in lending to commercial paper issuers), there is scope for repricing that will allow these services to continue to be offered. Thus there seems to be little reason for central banks to avoid bringing the policy rate close to zero if the economic situation warranted. A quite different argument for engaging in alternative monetary policies before lowering the TIME rate all the way to zero is that the public might interpret a zero instrument rate as evidence that the central bank has \"run out of ammunition.\" That is, low rates risk fostering the misimpression that monetary policy is ineffective. As we have stressed, that would indeed be a misimpression, as the central bank has means of providing monetary stimulus other than the conventional measure of lowering the TIME nominal interest rate. However, it is also true that the considerable uncertainty that surrounds the use of these alternative measures does make the calibration of policy actions more difficult. Moreover, given the important role for expectations in making many of these policies work, the communications challenges would be considerable. Given these risks, policymakers are well advised to act preemptively and aggressively to avoid facing the complications raised by the zero lower bound.",

                  "Alan Greenspan: Risk and uncertainty in monetary policy Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, DATE. TIME I plan to sketch the key developments of DATE of monetary policy in the United States from the perspective of someone who has been in the policy trenches. I will offer some conclusions about what I believe has been learned thus far, though I suspect, as is so often the case, the passing of time, further study, and reflection will deepen our understanding of these developments. This is a personal statement; I am not speaking for my current colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the many others with whom I have served over these many DATE.NUM The tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in DATE, then led by my predecessor Paul Volcker, ultimately broke the back of price acceleration in the United States, ushering in a DATE long decline in inflation that eventually brought us to the current state of price stability. The fall in inflation over this period has been global in scope, and arguably beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic inflation fighters. I have little doubt that an unrelenting focus of monetary policy on achieving price stability has been the principal contributor to disinflation. Indeed, the notion, advanced by Milton Friedman DATE, that inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon is no longer a controversial proposition in the profession. But the size and geographic extent of the decline in inflation raises the question of whether other forces have been at work as well. I am increasingly of the view that, at a minimum, monetary policy in DATE has been operating in an environment particularly conducive to the pursuit of price stability. The principal features of this environment included (NUM) increased political support for stable prices, which was the consequence of, and reaction to, the unprecedented peacetime inflation in DATE, (NUM) globalization, which unleashed powerful new forces of competition, and (NUM) an acceleration of productivity, which at least for a time held down cost pressures. I believe we at the Fed, to our credit, did gradually come to recognize the structural economic changes that we were living through and accordingly altered our understanding of the key parameters of the economic system and our policy stance. The central banks of other industrialized countries have grappled with many of the same issues. But as we lived through it, there was much uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and about the influence of monetary policy. Despite those uncertainties, the trauma of DATE was still so vivid throughout DATE that preventing a return to accelerating prices was the unvarying focus of our efforts during DATE. In recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an important feature of policy. As a consequence, this approach elevated forecasting to an even more prominent place in policy deliberations. After an almost uninterrupted stint of easing from DATE, the Fed again began to lean against increasing inflationary pressures, which were in part the indirect result of rapidly rising stock prices. We had recognized the risk of an adverse reaction in a stock market that had recently experienced a steep run-up - indeed, we actively engaged in contingency planning against that possibility. In the event, the crash in DATE was far more traumatic than any of the possible scenarios we had identified. Previous planning was only marginally useful in that episode. We operated essentially in a crisis mode, responding with an immediate and massive injection of liquidity to help stabilize highly volatile financial markets. However, most of our stabilization efforts were directed at keeping the payments system functioning and markets open. The concern over the possible fallout on economic activity from so sharp a stock price decline kept us easing into DATE. But the economy weathered that shock reasonably well, and our easing extended perhaps longer than hindsight has indicated was necessary. That period was followed by a preemptive tightening that brought the federal funds rate close to NUM percent by DATE. In DATE, we sensed enough softening of activity to warrant beginning a series of rate reductions. However, the weakening of demand already under way, some pullback of credit by lenders, and the spike in oil prices associated with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were sufficient to produce a marked contraction of activity in DATE. But perhaps aided by our preemptive action, the recession was, to then, the mildest in postwar history. However, the recovery also was more modest than usual, in large measure because of the notable financial \"headwinds\" that confronted businesses. Those headwinds were primarily generated by the constriction of credit in response to major losses at banks, associated with real-estate and foreign lending, coupled with a crisis in the savings and loan industry that had its origins in a serious maturity mismatch as interest rates rose. With their access to managed funds threatened and the quality of their loan portfolio - and hence their capital - uncertain, these depositories were most reluctant to lend. Policy eased gradually but persistently to counter the effects of these developments, with the funds rate falling to NUM percent by DATE, its lowest level since DATE. The uptilt to the term structure of interest rates in a generally low interest rate environment restored bank profitability and, eventually, bank capital. The credit crunch slowly lifted. By DATE, as the headwinds of financial restraint abated, it became clear that underlying price pressures were again building. If we had left those pressures unchecked, we would have put at risk some of the hard-won gains that had been achieved over DATE. So, starting from a real federal funds rate that was close to zero, a preemptive tightening was initiated. The resulting rise in the funds rate of NUM basis points over DATE apparently defused those nascent inflationary pressures. Though economic activity hesitated in DATE, it soon steadied, confirming the achievement of a historically elusive soft landing. The success of that period set up two powerful expectations that were to influence developments over DATE. One was the expectation that inflation could be controlled over the business cycle and that price stability was an achievable objective. The second expectation, in part a consequence of more stable inflation, was that overall economic volatility had been reduced and would likely remain lower than it had previously. Of course, these new developments brought new challenges. In particular, the prospect that a necessary cyclical adjustment was now behind us fostered increasing levels of optimism, which were manifested in a fall in bond risk spreads and a rise in stock prices. The associated decline in the cost of equity capital further spurred already developing increases in capital investment and productivity growth, both of which broadened impressively in the latter part of DATE. The rise in structural productivity growth was not obvious in the official data on gross product per hour worked until DATE, but precursors had emerged earlier. The pickup in new bookings and order backlogs for high-tech capital goods in DATE seemed incongruous given the sluggish economic environment at the time. Plant managers apparently were reacting to what they perceived to be elevated prospective rates of return on the newer technologies, a judgment that was confirmed as orders and profits continued to increase through DATE. Moreover, even though TIME labor compensation and profit margins were rising, prices were being contained, implying increasing growth in output per hour.NUM As a consequence of the improving trend in structural productivity growth that was apparent from DATE forward, we at the Fed were able to be much more accommodative to the rise in economic growth than our past experiences would have deemed prudent. We were motivated, in part, by the view that the evident structural economic changes rendered suspect, at best, the prevailing notion in DATE of an elevated and reasonably stable NAIRU. Those views were reinforced as inflation continued to fall in the context of a declining unemployment rate that by DATE had dipped below NUM percent in the United States for the first time in DATE. Notions that prevailed for a time in DATE and DATE that even high single-digit inflation did not measurably impede economic growth were gradually abandoned as the evidence of significant benefits of low inflation became increasingly persuasive. Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the DATE. To preserve these benefits, we engaged in our most recent preemptive tightening in DATE that brought the funds rate to NUM-NUM/NUM percent by May DATE. Our goal of price stability was achieved by most analysts' definition by DATE. Unstinting and largely preemptive efforts over DATE had finally paid off. Throughout the period, a key objective has been to ensure that our response to incipient changes in inflation was forceful enough. As John Taylor has emphasized, in the face of an incipient increase in inflation, nominal interest rates must move up more than one-for-one.NUM Perhaps the greatest irony of DATE is that the gradually unfolding success against inflation may well have contributed to the stock price bubble of the latter part of DATE.NUM Looking back on DATE, it is evident that technology-driven increases in productivity growth imparted significant upward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to stock prices.NUM At the same time, an environment of increasing macroeconomic stability reduced perceptions of risk. In any event, Fed policymakers were confronted with forces that none of us had previously encountered. Aside from the then-recent experience of Japan, only remote historical episodes gave us clues to the appropriate stance for policy under such conditions. The sharp rise in stock prices and their subsequent fall were, thus, an especial challenge to the Federal Reserve. It is far from obvious that bubbles, even if identified early, can be preempted at lower cost than a substantial economic contraction and possible financial destabilization - the very outcomes we would be seeking to avoid. In fact, our experience over the past DATE suggests that a moderate monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without substantial effect on economic activity has often been associated with increases subsequent in the level of stock prices.NUM Arguably, markets that pass that type of stress test are presumed particularly resilient. The notion that a well-timed incremental tightening could have NUM See, for example, \"A Half-Century of Changes in Monetary Policy,\" John B. Taylor, remarks delivered at the conference in honor of Milton Friedman, DATE, pp NUM-NUM, manuscript, Department of the Treasury. NUM It is notable, that in the United States, surges in price-earnings ratios, a presumed essential characteristic of an equity price bubble, are not observed with elevated inflation expectations. NUM But, as the Federal Reserve indicated in congressional testimony in DATE, \"... productivity acceleration does not ensure that equity prices are not overextended. There can be little doubt that if the nation's productivity growth has stepped up, the level of profits and their future potential would be elevated. That prospect has supported higher stock prices. The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future become relatively small. Such straying above fundamentals could create problems for our economy when the inevitable adjustment occurs.\" Testimony of Alan Greenspan before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, DATE. NUM For example, stock prices rose following the completion of the more than NUM basis point rise in the federal funds rate in the DATE ending in February NUM. And during DATE in DATE, when the Federal Reserve again raised the federal funds target NUM basis points, stock prices initially flattened. But as soon as that round of tightening was completed, prices resumed their marked upward advance. From DATE through May DATE, the federal funds rate was raised NUM basis points. However, equity price increases were largely undeterred during that period despite what now, in retrospect, was the exhausted tail of a bull market. Stock prices peaked in March DATE, but the market basically moved sideways until DATE. Such data suggest that nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic retrenchment with all its attendant risks is sufficient to check a nascent bubble. Certainly, NUM basis points proved inadequate to even dent stock prices in DATE. BIS Review DATE been calibrated to prevent DATE bubble while preserving economic stability is almost surely an illusion.NUM Instead of trying to contain a putative bubble by drastic actions with largely unpredictable consequences, we chose, as we noted in our DATE congressional testimony, to focus on policies \"to mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next expansion.\"NUM During DATE, in the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble and the acts of terrorism in September DATE, the federal funds rate was lowered NUM-NUM/NUM percentage points. Subsequently, another NUM basis points were pared, bringing the rate by DATE to its current NUM percent, the lowest level in DATE. We were able to be unusually aggressive in the initial stages of the recession of DATE because both inflation and inflation expectations were low and stable. We thought we needed to be, and could be, forceful in DATE and DATE as well because, with demand weak, inflation risks had become two-sided for the first time in DATE. There appears to be enough evidence, at least tentatively, to conclude that our strategy of addressing the bubble's consequences rather than the bubble itself has been successful. Despite the stock market plunge, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we experienced an exceptionally mild recession - even milder than that of DATE. As I discuss later, much of the ability of the U.S. economy to absorb these sequences of shocks resulted from notably improved structural flexibility. But highly aggressive monetary ease was doubtless also a significant contributor to stability.NUM The Federal Reserve's experiences over the past DATE make it clear that uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape. The term \"uncertainty\" is meant here to encompass both \"Knightian uncertainty,\" in which the probability distribution of outcomes is unknown, and \"risk,\" in which uncertainty of outcomes is delimited by a known probability distribution. In practice, one is never quite sure what type of uncertainty one is dealing with in real time, and it may be best to think of a continuum ranging from well-defined risks to the truly unknown. As a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management. This conceptual framework emphasizes understanding as much as possible the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakers face, quantifying those NUM Some have asserted that the Federal Reserve can deflate a stock-price bubble - rather painlessly - by boosting margin requirements. The evidence suggests otherwise. First, the amount of margin debt is small, having never amounted to more than about NUM-NUM/NUM percent of the market value of equities; moreover, even this figure overstates the amount of margin debt used to purchase stock, as such debt also finances short sales of equity and transactions in non-equity securities. Second, investors need not rely on margin debt to take a leveraged position in equities. They can borrow from other sources to buy stock. Or, they can purchase options, which will affect stock prices given the linkages across markets. Thus, not surprisingly, the preponderance of research suggests that changes in margins are not an effective tool for reducing stock market volatility. It is possible that margin requirements inhibit very small investors whose access to other forms of credit is limited. If so, the only effect of increasing margin requirements is to price out of the market the very small investor without addressing the broader issue of stock price bubbles. If a change in margin requirements were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank would soon tighten monetary policy enough to burst a bubble, then there might be the appearance of a causal effect. But it is the prospect of monetary policy action, not the margin increase, that should be viewed as the trigger. In a similar manner, history tells us that \"jawboning\" asset markets will be ineffective unless backed by action. NUM Op. cit. NUM Some have argued that, as a consequence of the DATE-DATE speculative episode, long-term imbalances remain, having been only partly addressed since early DATE, the peak of the post-bubble business cycle. For example, large residues of household and external debt are perceived as barriers to future growth. But in the past, imbalances that led to business contractions were rarely fully reversed before the subsequent economic upturn began. Presumably they were fully reversed in later periods, or they continued to fester, but not by enough to halt economic growth. Even if imbalances still persist in our current environment, the business decline that began in March DATE came to an end in DATE, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. We experienced tepid recovery until DATE, when GDP accelerated considerably. Hence, when the next recession arrives, as it inevitably will, it will be a stretch to attribute it to speculative imbalances of DATE. BIS Review DATE risks when possible, and assessing the costs associated with each of the risks. In essence, the risk management approach to monetary policymaking is an application of Bayesian decisionmaking. This framework also entails devising, in light of those risks, a strategy for policy directed at maximizing the probabilities of achieving over time our goals of price stability and the maximum sustainable economic growth that we associate with it. In designing strategies to meet our policy objectives, we have drawn on the work of analysts, both inside and outside the Fed, who over DATE have devoted much effort to improving our understanding of the economy and its monetary transmission mechanism. A critical result has been the identification of a relatively small set of key relationships that, taken together, provide a useful approximation of our economy's dynamics. Such an approximation underlies the statistical models that we at the Federal Reserve employ to assess the likely influence of our policy decisions. However, despite extensive efforts to capture and quantify what we perceive as the key macroeconomic relationships, our knowledge about many of the important linkages is far from complete and, in all likelihood, will always remain so. Every model, no matter how detailed or how well designed, conceptually and empirically, is a vastly simplified representation of the world that we experience with all its intricacies on a day-to-day basis. Given our inevitably incomplete knowledge about key structural aspects of an ever-changing economy and the sometimes asymmetric costs or benefits of particular outcomes, a central bank needs to consider not only the most likely future path for the economy but also the distribution of possible outcomes about that path. The decisionmakers then need to reach a judgment about the probabilities, costs, and benefits of the various possible outcomes under alternative choices for policy. A policy action that is calculated to be optimal based on a simulation of one particular model may not, in fact, be optimal once the full extent of the risks surrounding the most likely path is taken into account. In general, different policies will exhibit different degrees of robustness with respect to the true underlying structure of the economy. For example, policy A might be judged as best advancing the policymakers' objectives, conditional on a particular model of the economy, but might also be seen as having relatively severe adverse consequences if the true structure of the economy turns out to be other than the one assumed. On the other hand, policy B might be somewhat less effective in advancing the policy objectives under the assumed baseline model but might be relatively benign in the event that the structure of the economy turns out to differ from the baseline. DATE, these considerations inclined Federal Reserve policymakers toward an easier stance of policy aimed at limiting the risk of deflation even though baseline forecasts from most conventional models at that time did not project deflation; that is, we chose a policy that, in a world of perfect certainty, would have been judged to be too loose. As this episode illustrates, policy practitioners operating under a risk-management paradigm may, at times, be led to undertake actions intended to provide insurance against especially adverse outcomes. Following the Russian debt default in DATE, for example, the FOMC eased policy despite our perception that the economy was expanding at a satisfactory pace and that, even without a policy initiative, it was likely to continue doing so.NUM We eased policy because we were concerned about the low-probability risk that the default might trigger events that would severely disrupt domestic and international financial markets, with outsized adverse feedback to the performance of the U.S. economy. The product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious threat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable scenario. That possibility of higher inflation caused us little concern at the time, largely because increased productivity growth was resulting in only limited increases in unit labor costs and heightened competition, driven by globalization, was thwarting employers' ability to pass through those limited cost increases into prices. Given the potential consequences of the Russian default, the benefits of the unusual policy action were judged to outweigh its costs. Such a cost-benefit analysis is an ongoing part of monetary policy decisionmaking and causes us to tip more toward monetary ease when a contractionary event, such as the Russian default, seems especially likely or the costs associated with it seem especially high. The DATE liquidity crisis and the crises associated with the stock market crash of DATE and the terrorism of September DATE prompted the type of massive ease that has been the historic mandate of a central bank. Such crises are precipitated by the efforts of market participants to convert illiquid assets into cash. When confronted with uncertainty, especially Knightian uncertainty, human beings invariably attempt to disengage from medium to long-term commitments in favor of safety and liquidity. Because economies, of necessity, are net long - that is, have net real assets - attempts to flee these assets cause prices of equity assets to fall, in some cases dramatically. In the crisis that emerged in DATE, pressures extended beyond equity markets. Credit-risk spreads widened materially and investors put a particularly high value on liquidity, as evidenced by the extraordinarily wide yield gaps that emerged between on-the-run and off-the-run U.S. Treasuries. The immediate response on the part of the central bank to such financial implosions must be to inject large quantities of liquidity - or as Walter Bagehot put it, describing such policies of the Bank of England DATE, in a panic the Bank should lend at very high rates of interest \"to all that bring good securities quickly, freely, and readily.\"NUM This was perhaps an early articulation of a crisis risk management policy for a central bank. The economic world in which we function is best described by a structure whose parameters are continuously changing. The channels of monetary policy, consequently, are changing in tandem. An ongoing challenge for the Federal Reserve - indeed, for any central bank - is to operate in a way that does not depend on a fixed economic structure based on historically average coefficients. We often fit simple models only because we cannot estimate a continuously changing set of parameters without vastly more observations than are currently available to us. Moreover, we recognize that the simple linear functions underlying most of our econometric structures may not hold outside the range in which adequate economic observations exist. For example, it is difficult to have much confidence in the ability of models fit to the data of the moderate inflations of the postwar period to accurately predict what the behavior of the economy would be in an environment of aggregate price deflation. In pursuing a risk-management approach to policy, we must confront the fact that only a limited number of risks can be quantified with any confidence. And even these risks are generally quantifiable only if we accept the assumption that the future will, at least in some important respects, resemble the past. Policymakers often have to act, or choose not to act, even though we may not fully understand the full range of possible outcomes, let alone each possible outcome's likelihood. As a result, risk management often involves significant judgment as we evaluate the risks of different events and the probability that our actions will alter those risks. For such judgment, policymakers have needed to reach beyond models to broader - though less mathematically precise - hypotheses about how the world works. For example, inferences about how market participants and, hence, the economy might respond to a monetary policy initiative may need to be drawn from evidence about past behavior during a period only roughly comparable to the current situation. Some critics have argued that such an approach to policy is too undisciplined - judgmental, seemingly discretionary, and difficult to explain. The Federal Reserve, they conclude, should attempt to be more formal in its operations by tying its actions solely, or in the weaker paradigm, largely, to the prescriptions of a simple policy rule. Indeed, rules that relate the setting of the federal funds rate to the deviations of output and inflation from their respective targets, in some configurations, do seem to capture the broad contours of what we did over DATE. And the prescriptions of formal rules can, in fact, serve as helpful adjuncts to policy, as many of the proponents of these rules have suggested. But at crucial points, like those in our recent policy history - the stock market crash of DATE, the crises of DATE, and the events that followed September DATE - simple rules will be inadequate as either descriptions or prescriptions for policy. Moreover, such rules suffer from much of the same fixed-coefficient difficulties we have with our large-scale models. To be sure, sensible policymaking can be accomplished only with the aid of a rigorous analytic structure. A rule does provide a benchmark against which to assess emerging developments. However, any rule capable of encompassing every possible contingency would lose a key aspect of its attractiveness: simplicity. On the other hand, no simple rule could possibly describe the policy action to be taken in every contingency and thus provide a satisfactory substitute for an approach based on the principles of risk management. As I indicated earlier, policy has worked off a risk-management paradigm in which the risk and costbenefit analyses depend on forecasts of probabilities developed from large macromodels, numerous submodels, and judgments based on less mathematically precise regimens. Such judgments, by their nature, are based on bits and pieces of history that cannot formally be associated with an analysis of variance. Yet, there is information in those bits and pieces. For example, while we have been unable to readily construct a variable that captures the apparent increased degree of flexibility in the United States or the global economy, there has been too much circumstantial evidence of this critically important trend to ignore its existence. Increased flexibility is a likely source of changing structural coefficients. Our problem is not, as is sometimes alleged, the complexity of our policymaking process, but the far greater complexity of a world economy whose underlying linkages appear to be continuously evolving. Our response to that continuous evolution has been disciplined by the Bayesian type of decisionmaking in which we have engaged. While all, no doubt, would prefer that it were otherwise, there is no way to dismiss what has to be obvious to every monetary policymaker: The success of monetary policy depends importantly on the quality of forecasting. The ability to gauge risks implies some judgment about how current economic imbalances will ultimately play out. Thus, both econometric and qualitative models need to be continually tested. The first signs that a relationship may have changed is usually the emergence of events that seem inconsistent with our hypotheses of the way the economic world is supposed to behave. The anomalous rise in high-tech capital goods orders in DATE, to which I alluded earlier, is one such example. The credit crunch of DATE is another. The emergence of inflation targeting in DATE is an interesting development in this regard. As practiced, it emphasizes forecasts, but within a more rule-like structure that skews monetary policy toward inflation containment as the primary goal. Indeed, its early applications were in high-inflation countries where discretionary monetary policy fell into disrepute. Inflation targeting often originated as a fairly simple structure concentrating solely on inflation outcomes, but it has evolved into more-discretionary forms requiring complex judgments for implementation. Indeed, this evolution has gone so far that the actual practice of monetary policy by inflation-targeting central banks now closely resembles the practice of those central banks, such as the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve, that have not chosen to adopt that paradigm. In practice, most central banks, at least those not bound by an exchange rate peg, behave in roughly the same way. They seek price stability as their long-term goal and, accounting for the lag in monetary policy, calibrate the setting of the policy rate accordingly. Central banks generally appear to have embraced a common model of the channels through which monetary policy functions, although the specifics and emphasis given to those channels vary according to our particular circumstances. All banks ease when economic conditions ease and tighten when economic conditions tighten, even if in differing degrees, regardless of whether they are guided by",

As always, the views I will express are my own and are not to be attributed to my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.NUM It is beginning to appear that DATE was DATE for the American economy, following what had been, on many dimensions, a subpar performance for the better part of DATE. Though officially the recession lasted DATE, from DATE, a period of economic underperformance began with the sharp decline in stock prices and business investment in mid-NUM and continued through DATE leading up to the Iraq war DATE. To a degree that is unusual for postwar recessions, the economic weakness of the period was most apparent in the business sector, even as consumer spending and residential construction remained robust. Businesses radically pared their spending on new capital goods and cut the ratio of inventory stocks to sales to historical lows. In an effort to restore profitability in an environment of weak demand and nonexistent pricing power, businesses also worked hard to improve efficiency and cut costs. These efforts have paid off in terms of remarkable increases in productivity, but, together with insufficient growth in aggregate demand, they also contributed to a significant decline in employment. Like the aftermath of the DATE recession, DATE since the recession trough in DATE have been described as a \"jobless recovery.\" Indeed, the lag between the recovery in output and the recovery in employment has been significantly greater this time than it was after the DATE downturn. Monetary policy was deployed to support the weakening economy, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) aggressively cut rates in DATE and has continued its policy of accommodation since then. Fiscal policy, including two rounds of tax cuts, has also been highly stimulative. However, despite some early promise, initially the upturn proved halting and erratic. Policymakers and privatesector economists recognized early on that a balanced recovery would require willingness on the part of the business sector to begin investing and hiring again, but forecasts of improved business sentiment repeatedly proved wrong, or at least premature. In some sectors, such as nonresidential construction and communications, capital overhangs and capital misallocation, the result of the earlier boom, reduced both the need and the financial capacity to invest. Importantly, the economy was also hit by a succession of shocks - notably the September NUM, DATE, terrorist attacks, the corporate governance and accounting scandals of DATE, and the Iraq war in DATE DATE - each of which created new uncertainties and left its mark on business confidence. Despite all this adversity, there could never have been any doubt that the diversified and resilient U.S. economy, assisted by ample monetary and fiscal stimulus, would eventually stage a comeback. After several false starts, it now appears that that comeback began in earnest in the summer of DATE. As you know, the third quarter of DATE displayed near-record levels of real economic growth, in the vicinity of NUM percent at an DATE rate, and growth appears to have continued strong in the fourth quarter of DATE. The most heartening aspect of this vigorous expansion is that, finally, the business sector appears to have emerged from its funk. Corporate investment has been strong, particularly in equipment and software, and there are some recent signs that both inventory investment and hiring have begun to pick up. Of course, downside risks to the economy remain: The recovery in capital investment may prove less durable than it now appears, the moderation of fiscal stimulus in the latter part of DATE could adversely affect household spending, or new unfavorable shocks - geopolitical or otherwise - may yet appear. Still, the incoming data have continued for the most part to surprise on the upside, and the odds accordingly have increased that DATE will be remembered as DATE when this recovery turned the corner. Private-sector forecasters generally expect real growth to be approximately NUM percent in DATE, and they foresee modest improvements in the unemployment rate DATE and continued reductions in unemployment in DATE. I think these predictions are broadly reasonable, and indeed I would not be surprised if the pace of real growth DATE exceeded NUM percent. With this generally upbeat scenario in mind, some observers in the markets and the media have questioned the appropriateness of the current stance of monetary policy. Certainly, the policy stance we have DATE is historically unusual. DATE after the recession trough, and following DATE of strong growth, the historically normal pattern would be for the Fed to be well into the process of tightening policy by now. Instead, the FOMC has held its policy instrument rate, the federal funds rate, at the very low level of NUM percent. I would like to take some time now to explain why I believe this policy remains appropriate, despite its historically unusual character. The positive case for maintaining an accommodative monetary policy at this stage of the recovery has three elements, some of which will be familiar to many of you, at least in broad outline. First, core inflation rates in the United States are as low DATE as they have been in DATE, and they have been trending downward. For example, the DATE inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index, current-methods basis and excluding food and energy prices, was NUM percent at the recession trough in DATE. This measure of core inflation fell to NUM percent as of DATE and to only NUM percent as of November DATE. Other measures of core inflation, such as the one based on the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, have displayed a similar pattern. Inflation is not simply low; for my taste, it is very nearly at the bottom of the acceptable range for (measured) inflation. In contrast, in previous episodes of recovery, inflation was above the range consistent with price stability, so that a tightening of monetary policy at an earlier stage of the expansion represented the prudent response to inflation risks. Because inflation is so low DATE, monetary policy can afford to be more patient to ensure that the recovery is self-sustaining. The second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable increase in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in DATE. Those productivity increases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for given growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of production, which puts downward pressure on prices. I will first address the effect of productivity on costs, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap. Labor costs account for the lion's share, about two-thirds, of the cost of producing goods and services. The labor cost of producing a unit of output depends, first, on the dollar cost per hour (including wages and benefits) of employing a worker and, second, on the quantity of output that each worker produces per hour. When the cost per hour of employing a worker rises more quickly than the worker's TIME productivity - the historically normal situation - then the dollar labor cost of producing each unit of output, the so-called unit labor cost, tends to rise. Recently, however, labor productivity has grown even more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have declined in each of the past DATE. Indeed, in the second and third quarters of DATE, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector are currently estimated to have declined by a remarkable NUM and NUM percent, respectively, at DATE rates. Again, because labor costs are such a large part of overall costs, and because capital costs have also been moderate, the business sector has enjoyed a net decline in total production costs. A decline in production costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for producers, or both. In practice, both have occurred in DATE: Firms have passed on part of the reduction in costs on to final consumers in the form of lower (or more slowly rising) prices, and pricecost markups (as best we can measure them) have risen well above their historical averages. The high level of markups is an important and perhaps insufficiently recognized feature of the current economic situation. To the extent that firms can maintain these markups, profits will continue to be high, supporting investment and equity values. To the extent that product-market competition erodes these markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate, even if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.NUM The third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market. As I already noted, fully DATE after the official recession trough, we are only just beginning to see significant gains in employment. Of course, the unemployment rate, at about NUM percent of the labor force, is not exceptionally high by historical standards, and one can debate the degree to which structural change and other factors may have affected the level of employment that can be sustained without overheating the economy. Assessing the amount of slack in the labor market is very difficult and ultimately a matter of judgment. Reasonable people can certainly disagree. However, my sense is that, when one looks at the full range of information available, the labor market looks (if anything) weaker than a NUM percent unemployment rate suggests. For example, it appears that workers who have lost their jobs in DATE have been more likely to withdraw from the labor force (rather than report themselves as unemployed) than were job losers in previous recessions. Indeed, the labor force participation rate fell sharply between NUM and DATE, from a little over NUM percent to about NUM-NUM/NUM percent. Similarly, the ratio of employment to the working-age population, a statistic that reflects both those who become unemployed and those who leave the labor force, has fallen significantly, by NUM percentage points between its peak in DATE and its trough DATE. The tendency of recent job losers to leave the labor force likely masks some of the effects of job cuts on the unemployment rate, so that the current measured level of unemployment may understate the extent of job loss or the difficulty of finding new work. Of course, a labor market that is slack and improving only slowly is likely to produce continued slow growth in nominal wages, contributing to continued moderate growth in costs. Why has the labor market remained relatively weak, despite increasingly rapid growth in output? I addressed the causes of the \"jobless recovery\" in an earlier talk (Bernanke, DATE). Although many factors have affected the rate of job creation, I concluded in my earlier analysis that the rapid rate of productivity growth, already discussed in relation to unit labor costs, has also been an important reason for the slow pace of recovery in the labor market. All else equal, strong productivity gains allow firms to meet a given level of demand with fewer employees. Thus, for given growth in aggregate spending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.NUM To summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my view) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy. First, inflation is historically low, perhaps at the bottom of the acceptable range, and has recently continued its decline. Second, rapid productivity growth has led to actual declines in nominal production costs, which reduce current and future inflationary pressures. Finally, the labor market remains soft, reflecting the fact that growth in aggregate demand has been so far insufficient to absorb the increases in aggregate supply afforded by higher productivity. A soft labor market will keep a lid on the growth in the cost of employing workers. An accommodative monetary policy is needed, in my view, to support the ongoing recovery, particularly in the labor market. At the same time, the risks of policy accommodation seem low, as inflation is low and inflation pressures seem quite subdued. These arguments notwithstanding, I realize that some remain unconvinced that the FOMC is pursuing the right course. Citing factors such as the rise in commodity prices and the decline of the dollar, a number of observers have warned that the Federal Reserve's policies risk re-igniting inflation. I would like to address these concerns briefly. Naturally, I will try to show why these arguments are not of immediate concern, given the three points I made earlier in support of the current accommodative policy. Before I do that, though, I would like to emphasize to those uncomfortable with the Fed's policy stance that, speaking for myself at least, their views are being heard and taken seriously. Achieving price stability in the United States was an historic accomplishment, and preserving that legacy is crucially important. I say that not only because I think that price stability promotes long-run growth and efficiency, which I do, but also because I believe that low inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations are critical to maintaining economic stability in the short run. Price stability is of utmost importance to the nation's economic health, and I believe that the FOMC will do whatever is necessary to be sure that inflation remains well contained. With that preface, I will address briefly a few concerns of those who worry that inflation is poised to rise, beginning with the recent behavior of commodity prices. A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over DATE, including a large jump in DATE. This acceleration has been broadly mirrored in the behavior of the core producer price indexes (PPIs) for crude and intermediate materials, probably the best and most comprehensive measures of prices at early stages of processing. Specifically, over the past DATE, the DATE change in the core PPI for crude materials has risen rather dramatically, from -NUM percent to NUM percent, and the DATE change in the core PPI for intermediate materials has risen from -NUM percent to NUM percent. Do these developments imply a significant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer? The answer is almost certainly not. Two points should be made. First, the recent movements in commodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business cycle. The acceleration in the core PPI for crude materials that we have seen is about what should have been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide economic activity.NUM The increase in the demand for commodities from China alone has been substantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen from less than NUM percent in DATE to NUM percent in DATE. The much more moderate acceleration in intermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some additional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy prices. Second, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule, both because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in the cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors. Accelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred following the DATE and DATE recessions, as well as in DATE and DATE, with no noticeable impact on inflation at the consumer level.NUM A reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent NUM percent increase in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a NUM percent increase in the price of intermediate goods and to less than a NUM percent increase in consumer prices. Thus the recent acceleration in commodity prices, even if it were to persist (and futures prices suggest that it will not), would likely add only a tenth or two to the core inflation rate. In short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of strengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level. Two specific commodity prices that often command attention are the prices of gold and crude petroleum. The price of gold has increased roughly NUM percent since its low in April DATE, from about $NUM per ounce to about $NUM per ounce. A portion of that increase simply reflects dollar depreciation, which I will discuss momentarily. Gold also represents a safe haven investment, however, and I agree that there have been periods in the past when the fear that drove investors into gold was the fear of inflation. But gold prices also respond to geopolitical tensions; these tensions have certainly heightened since DATE and, in my view, can account for the bulk of the recent increase in the real price of gold. Oil prices are relatively high, in the range of $NUM/barrel, but they have been elevated for most of DATE, despite a broadly disinflationary environment. According to futures markets, oil prices are expected to decline gradually over the next DATE, despite accelerating economic activity, as new supplies are brought on line. Of course, there is considerable uncertainty about what the price of oil will do, given the possibility of supply disruptions. But if it follows the course projected by the futures market, the price of oil should have a modest disinflationary effect on overall consumer prices in DATE. Let me turn now to the recent depreciation of the dollar and its implications for inflation. The dollar has fallen dramatically against some major currencies, notably the euro, against which the dollar has declined roughly NUM percent from its recent peak in DATE. However, looking at movements of the dollar against a single currency can be misleading about overall trends; broader measures of dollar strength show somewhat less of a decline. For example, an index of the dollar's real value against the currencies of important U.S. trading partners, weighted by trade shares, has fallen only about NUM percent from its peak in DATE. Notably, this broader index of dollar value remains about NUM percent above its average value in the DATEs and NUM percent above the low it reached in DATE. Moreover, the direct effects of dollar depreciation on inflation, like those of commodity price increases, appear to be relatively small. In part, the small effect reflects the modest weight of imports in the consumer's basket of goods and services. Perhaps more importantly, however, the evidence suggests that foreign producers tend to absorb most of the effect of changes in the value of the dollar rather than \"passing through\" these effects to the prices they charge U.S. consumers. A reasonable estimate of the portion of changes in the value of the dollar passed through to U.S. consumers is about NUM percent. The extent of passthrough also appears to have declined over time, suggesting that foreign producers also lack \"pricing power\" in the current low-inflation environment in the United States. Overall, on rough estimates, a NUM percent decline in the broad value of the dollar would be expected to add between one and three tenths to the level of core consumer prices (not the inflation rate), spread out over a period of time. I haven't said anything yet about the rate of growth of the money supply, another indicator that is sometimes cited by those concerned about inflation, largely because there is not too much to say. Growth in standard monetary measures such as the base and M2 has been moderate (and declining) in DATE, certainly well within expected ranges given the growth of nominal GDP and normal variation in velocity. For example, for DATE as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP. Even should money growth rates accelerate, however, I would caution against making strong inferences about the likely behavior of inflation, except in the very long run. Money growth has not proven to be especially useful for predicting inflation in the short run, in part because various institutional factors unrelated to monetary policy often affect the growth rate of money. A striking example of the way special factors can affect money growth rates is the fact that M2 growth has actually been sharply negative, at about -NUM percent at an DATE rate, for DATE for which data are available. Factors such as the falloff in mortgage refinancing activity and outflows from retail money market funds into equities and other investments are the proximate explanations for the decline in M2. Certainly, this short-term decline in broad money is not to be taken as evidence of tight monetary policy!NUM To summarize, DATE seems to have marked the turning point for the U. S. economy, and we have reason to be optimistic that DATE will see even more growth and continued progress in reducing unemployment. The remarkable strength and resiliency of the American economy - an economy that has shown the capacity to grow and become more productive in the face of serious adverse shocks - deserve most of the credit for these developments. Highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies have also played a role, of course. The Federal Reserve enters DATE with monetary policy that is unusually accommodative in historical terms, relative to the stage of the business cycle. That accommodation is justified, I believe, by the current very low level of inflation, and by the productivity gains and the weakness in the labor market, both of which suggest that inflation is likely to remain subdued. In my view, weighing the relative costs of the upside and downside risks also favors accommodation; in particular, it is important that we ensure, as best we can, that the current expansion will become self-sustaining and that the inflation rate does not fall further. On the other side, as I have already noted, the achievement of price stability must not and will not be jeopardized. We at the Federal Reserve will closely monitor developments in prices and wages, as well as conditions in the labor market and the broader economy, for any sign of incipient inflation. We will also look at the information that can be drawn from surveys and financial markets about inflation expectations. For now, I believe that the Federal Reserve has the luxury of being patient. However, I am also confident that, when the time comes, the Fed will act to ensure that inflation remains firmly under control.",

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Lessons from past productivity booms Speech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the American Economic Association, San Diego, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website. As we are all well aware, the United States has been enjoying significantly faster productivity growth for DATE than it did over DATE. Since DATE, labor productivity has risen at an average DATE rate of about NUM percent, up from an average DATE rate of around NUM-NUM/NUM percent between DATE and DATE. And in DATE alone, output per hour has increased more than NUM percent per year. The significance of the improvement since DATE can hardly be overstated, even after taking into account the cyclical component of DATE. If productivity were to continue to improve at an average DATE rate of NUM percent, the standard of living in the United States would double roughly every twenty-four years. If, on the other hand, productivity growth were to revert to an average DATE pace of NUM-NUM/NUM percent, a doubling in the standard of living would occur only every DATE. Many observers-including some economists-argue that the present era of robust trend productivity growth will soon come to an end. Others are more optimistic and argue that the potential gains to productivity from the technological advances associated with the computer revolution are far from complete.NUM Because productivity growth is critical to economic welfare, assessing the likelihood of these alternative outcomes is of considerable interest. In thinking about this issue, it is worth recognizing that periods of strong trend productivity growth, although perhaps novel to many of us, are not new to the U.S. economy. In fact, three earlier periods seem to stand out from the historical record as especially worthy of further scrutiny for the lessons they may offer regarding the current episode: a period in DATE from roughly the end of the Civil War to around DATE; DATE between the end of World War I and the onset of the Great Depression; and the period from DATE to the early 1970s.NUM Of particular note is that in at least two of the earlier episodes, heightened productivity growth lasted for an extended period - roughly twenty years or so. Thus, one objective in examining these previous productivity booms is to see whether we can glean any insights into the best ways to sustain the current episode of strong productivity growth. To be sure, each period mentioned can be associated with particular advances in technology, implying that technological progress is a necessary component of trend productivity growth. But significant technological advances were also evident in periods when productivity growth was less robust. Thus, a natural question to ask is whether other complementary factors - including aspects of the labor market, of the business environment, or of government policies - combine to render technological change especially potent or help to foster the transmission of technological change into real gains in the efficiency of the production process. Similarly, examining the historical record may shed light on the sustainability of the current boom. Do productivity booms simply run out of steam and die natural deaths? Or are they cut short by economic imbalances, exogenous shocks, or detrimental government policies? And, if the latter, are these cessations inevitable? At the outset, I should note that this lecture is co-authored with William Wascher, who is a member of the staff at the Board of Governors. To provide a roadmap of where we intend to go, I want to start by setting out some basic facts about previous periods of strong productivity growth in the United States. I will, of course, begin with some numbers. But I also want to discuss some of the technological innovations that contributed to these productivity booms and about the supportive roles played by changes in the organization of American businesses and the structure of financial markets, and by the U.S. education system. Finally, I will spend some time on the lessons that we think can be learned from what, in many ways, are striking similarities across the three previous episodes and the current one. Identifying previous productivity booms I should also note at this point that even the basic facts about economic growth, not to mention the interpretation of those facts, are sometimes subject to considerable debate. Some of these disagreements undoubtedly result from the lack of consistent information on U.S. productivity before data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) became available in DATE. For DATE period, we use data developed in DATE by John Kendrick, who constructed estimates of GDP consistent with the prevailing definitions in the National Income and Product Accounts going back to DATE (which had as their basis estimates made by Simon Kuznets in DATE).NUM These estimates are often cited as the best available measure of U.S output and productivity growth for that period. Although subsequent researchers - notably Balke and Gordon (DATE) and Romer (DATE) - have refined these estimates in different ways, the additional refinements focus primarily on the cyclical properties of output and do not significantly alter the qualitative statements about long-run growth made here. A number of economic historians - most notably Robert Gallman - have estimated U.S. GDP for the period before the Civil War.NUM However, given that their estimates are surely less reliable than those for the later, more industrialized period, we have elected to limit the focus of this lecture to the post-Civil War period. These caveats aside, average growth rates of productivity over various periods are presented in the table. We will focus on labor productivity (the first column) because that measure is the best indicator of improvement in the nation's standard of living. For the entire period from DATE, labor productivity has risen at an average rate of around NUM percent per year. However, productivity growth has not proceeded in a steady fashion. We have chosen time periods for our analysis that smooth through the business cycle, which is a significant source of shorter-term changes in rates of productivity growth. More important for this discussion is the variation in labor productivity growth that has occurred over longer stretches of time, with periods of robust growth interspersed with periods of more modest productivity gains. Using the Kendrick data as a guide and recognizing that the choice of any particular period is somewhat subjective, we take as the first episode of strong productivity growth - or productivity boom, if you will - roughly the period from DATE. During this period, labor productivity rose more than NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year, a rate thought to be considerably higher than the average growth experienced over DATE of the United States.NUM An important element of the analysis of this and other periods is the decomposition of output per hour into its underlying sources, including the contributions of multifactor productivity, capital deepening, and labor quality. In this regard, Kendrick's decomposition suggests that labor productivity growth in DATE was fueled importantly by capital investment.NUM During DATE, from DATE, the growth rate of labor productivity slowed to an average pace of only NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year, with modest rates of growth both in the capital stock and in multifactor productivity. The United States then enjoyed a relatively brief spurt in productivity until DATE, with labor productivity rising about NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year and multifactor productivity up around NUM NUM/NUM percent per year. This productivity boom was led by the expansion of the automobile industry and robust productivity gains in manufacturing more generally. Productivity growth was markedly slower through the Great Depression and World War II, largely reflecting a lack of capital deepening. Multifactor productivity rose at a relatively solid pace - albeit not as fast as earlier in the century - despite the weak economy during much of that period. Productivity growth since World War II is more familiar to us and is based on more reliable data - those constructed as part of the multifactor productivity program at the BLS. According to these data, labor productivity rose at an DATE rate of close to NUM percent from DATE to DATE - a period sometimes referred to as the golden age of productivity growth. During this period, productivity accelerated across a broad range of industries, and both capital deepening and gains in multifactor productivity contributed to the strong pace of growth. The productivity slowdown of DATE and DATE is also well known to us, and its possible causes have been the subject of much research. Labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of NUM percent per year over this period, while multifactor productivity growth fell to a pace of NUM percent, the slowest pace of any of the periods shown on the table. Finally, labor productivity growth has averaged about NUM percent at an DATE rate since DATE, with higher rates of both capital deepening and multifactor productivity growth contributing to the pickup. Sources of past productivity booms: technological change Although the productivity booms of DATE obviously differed in many respects, each episode can readily be associated with the introduction of one or more new technologies. The boom after the Civil War, for instance, appears to have had its genesis in technological improvements that increased the flexibility of production and reduced transportation costs, which allowed firms to take advantage of economies of scale in production and distribution. In particular, the widespread introduction of steam engines and machinery driven by new sources of energy enabled firms to move away from sources of waterpower and closer to areas where inputs - including labor and raw materials - were more readily available. The Midwest - where sources of waterpower were less abundant but coal was more abundant - benefited greatly from this development, and indeed within DATE became known as the \"industrial heartland\" of the United States. This regional shift in economic activity is illustrated by a sharp rise in the share of personal income generated in the Midwest DATE (from NUM percent to NUM percent), and the commensurate decline in the share of income generated in the Northeast (from NUM percent to NUM percent).NUM The increase in the importance of railroad transportation also helped raise productivity growth in DATE century.NUM Improved methods of steel production - notably, the Bessemer process, and later, Siemens's open hearth method - enabled railroads to lay longer-lasting steel track rather than iron track. And the growth of telegraphy enabled railroads to better coordinate the movement of trains over a wider area. As a result, railroads expanded their geographic coverage significantly after the Civil War: From DATE, the number of main track miles operated by railroad companies more than quintupled, from NUM,NUM miles to NUM,NUM miles, while the number of freight cars in operation jumped from NUM,NUM to more than NUM million.NUM The expansion of the railroads drove transportation costs sharply lower and allowed a significant increase in market size. Whereas, in DATE, the transportation of goods from New York to Chicago had required DATE even during DATE, by DATE, it could be accomplished in DATE any time of the year.NUM In addition, the construction of new rail lines in western states opened those markets to a wide range of East Coast and Midwest manufacturers. Moreover, some of the benefits of the productivity improvements in the railroad industry were passed on to producers in the form of lower costs of transporting goods. Freight rates fell from NUM-NUM/NUM cents per ton-mile in DATE to less than NUM cent per ton-mile by DATE. As a result, the quantity of goods transported by rail increased sharply, from about NUM billion ton-miles in DATE to NUM billion ton-miles in DATE.NUM Another major technological advance in DATE was the telegraph. Besides aiding the expansion of railroads by improving the coordination of rail traffic, the telegraph sharply reduced the costs of communicating in many other industries. And judging from the rapid growth in its use - the number of messages handled rose from about NUM million in DATE to nearly NUM million in DATE - the telegraph undoubtedly contributed to better decisionmaking and higher productivity throughout the economy.NUM Agriculture also was increasingly mechanized in DATE immediately after the Civil War, though the change was not as impressive as in the industrial sector. The abundance of land in western states limited the interest among farmers in raising land productivity. However, labor services were more difficult to obtain, so farmers were quite willing to invest in labor-saving machinery. As a result, the better plows, seed drills, reapers, and threshers developed by manufacturers were in high demand by farmers, and the amount of labor required to farm an acre of land fell sharply for many crops.NUM In the productivity boom of DATE, the chief technological innovation was most likely the spread of electrification to the factory floor. As Paul David and others have extensively documented, the use of electric motors in the production process increased substantially in DATE of the century.NUM In particular, the amount of mechanical energy derived from electric motors rose from NUM,NUM horsepower in DATE to nearly NUM million horsepower in DATE, and the fraction of overall factory horsepower produced with electricity rose from less than NUM percent to more than NUM percent over that period.NUM A major benefit of electric motors was that they enabled each machine in a factory to be powered by its own motor. This allowed manufacturing plants to be organized in a way that maximized the efficient movement of materials rather than the efficient transmission of power, and it facilitated the spread of continuous processing techniques and the assembly lines made popular by Henry Ford. Indeed, as electric power became less costly - aided by a steep reduction in regulated electricity rates after World War I - its use increased sharply, and factory productivity rose significantly. By one estimate, productivity growth in the manufacturing sector as a whole rose about NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year DATE and DATE.NUM Of course, other technological innovations also contributed to productivity growth during this period. Notable among them were the telephone - which by DATE had largely replaced the telegraph; the internal combustion engine, the use of which in motorized vehicles led to sizable productivity gains in the transportation and agriculture sectors; and a variety of technological advances in machine tools. In addition, DATE were characterized by the first wave of office automation equipment, including the portable typewriter and adding and duplicating machines. These machines improved the efficiency of a wide range of management and accounting tasks, and the demand for such equipment rose quite sharply DATE. Indeed, in real terms, business investment in office equipment increased from about $NUM million (in DATE dollars) in DATE to nearly $NUM million in DATE, with a particularly large jump evident in DATE.NUM The productivity gains of DATE, in part, had their roots in the technological innovations arising out of research sponsored by the military during World War II.NUM For example, although research advances in synthetic polymerization chemistry (most notably, the introduction of catalytic cracking in the processing of crude oil) were made in DATE and DATE, the synthetic rubber program launched during the war led to mass production of the first synthetic polymer from petroleumbased feedstocks. Similarly, production of polyethylene, a petrochemical-based plastic discovered in the DATE, jumped sharply in DATE because of its widespread use in military equipment. And, the military's need for large stocks of penicillin led to a production process for it that turned out to have applicability to a wide range of pharmaceuticals. The commercialization of these wartime innovations sharply increased the number of products made wholly or partly from newly developed plastic polymers and other synthetic materials. The use of polyethylene, for example, grew sharply after the war, while additional technological advances isolated new forms of synthetics and further reduced production costs for chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Overall, production in the rubber and plastic products industry rose nearly NUM percent per year DATE, while the output of the chemical products industry rose more than NUM percent DATEly over the same period.NUM Two other notable technological advances during this period were the invention of the transistor in DATE and the use of the jet engine in commercial aircraft. Commercial applications of the transistor, initially in solid state consumer electronic products, were stimulated by improvements in the fabrication process (in DATE) and by the introduction of the integrated circuit (in DATE). With the rise in demand, semiconductor production jumped markedly, rising nearly NUM percent per year during DATE, the introduction of the Boeing NUM in DATE sharply reduced the time and cost of transporting passengers and freight. In particular, according to estimates by Gordon (DATE), productivity in the commercial airline industry rose NUM percent per year during DATE, well above the rate of labor productivity growth for the economy as a whole.NUM For purposes of comparison, the technological origins of the more recent computer revolution also bear a brief mention. Obviously, the invention of the transistor and the development of the mainframe computer were precursors of the technological advances that contributed to the current productivity boom. However, the real drivers of the productivity gains in DATE were the related high-tech innovations of DATE and DATE, including the personal computer, fiber optics, wireless communications, and the Internet. Many of the recent technological innovations have significantly altered how firms interact with their customers, in ways that have raised the productivity of the economy. In the retail sector, the Internet stores made popular by Amazon.com have been adopted by nearly all large retail chains; in banking, it is now routine for customers to pay bills online; and for airlines, Internet reservations and e-tickets are the norm. Moreover, throughout the goods economy, from manufacturing to retailing, innovations in inventory management practices made possible by new technologies have substantially reduced costs. An important point about technological change is that, in most cases, the invention of the technologies that stimulated the productivity growth in these boom periods took place well before the productivity gains were realized. For example, the steam engine was invented in DATE, well before it had any measurable effect on the production process in the United States. Similarly, railroads were being built in DATE, and the first electric power plant was built in DATE. And as we all know, the absence of a significant contribution to productivity growth from computers, which were first introduced in DATE, was a puzzle to many economists as late as DATE. What then facilitated the translation of these innovations into gains in productivity? At one level, the delay reflected the challenges of developing commercial applications for the new technologies. The lag from a new invention to a new product or process was sometimes quite long because of the additional scientific research required to demonstrate its practicality. In addition, in many cases, new technologies diffused into the capital stock relatively slowly. Replacing older machines with equipment that embodied the new technologies was often not immediately profitable, and thus firms frequently took some time before making the capital investments required to take full advantage of technological progress. Sources of past productivity booms: organizational change A careful examination of past productivity booms also points to substantial changes in business practices and in the organization of firms as a key factor enabling businesses to achieve the potential productivity gains associated with new technologies.NUM In many cases, these organizational changes went hand in hand with the technological advances - the changes both being made possible by the new technologies and being necessary to achieve the additional productivity associated with the use of these technologies. For example, before the Civil War, most businesses were either sole proprietorships or partnerships serving local markets and consisted of small shops employing skilled workers involved in each aspect of the production process. At the same time that the spread of railroads lowered transportation costs and increased the size and number of potential markets, the greater availability of steam power enabled manufacturers to set up factories to take advantage of economies of scale in production. As a result, the optimal firm size rose substantially in many industries. In the cotton industry, for example, the median firm size (measured as the DATE value of gross production in DATE dollars) rose from $NUM,NUM in DATE to nearly $NUM,NUM in DATE; similarly, in the iron industry, median firm size rose from $NUM,NUM in DATE to more than $NUM,NUM in DATE.NUM In addition, large wholesalers (and later, retailers) emerged to take advantage of increased distributional efficiencies to sharply reduce the costs of moving commodities and manufactured goods from the farm or factory to retailers' shelves. These larger enterprises typically had to confront communications challenges not faced by smaller businesses. In particular, effective internal information flows were often crucial to the success of firms producing or distributing large volumes of inputs and outputs. The telegraph and the railroad-based postal service made prompt communication over great distances possible. But firms also had to set up hierarchical management systems to control the production process and to coordinate the flow of goods across the distribution system in order to take advantage of the economies of scale presented by technological change. Advances in production processes in DATE led to new challenges and opportunities for business organization. As noted above, the diffusion of the electric motor throughout the factory increased the use of continuous-process methods and the assembly line and thus accelerated the trend toward mass production. In addition, as early as DATE, manufacturers had begun to integrate forward into distribution; one noteworthy example was the meatpacking industry, in which firms purchased refrigerated rail cars that allowed shipment of beef from centralized slaughterhouses to branch houses that served local markets. The advances in mass production techniques and the increasing complexity of many manufactured products led firms in other industries to integrate forward not only into distribution but also into retailing; this vertical integration reduced transactions costs even more and further increased the optimal size of firms. Indeed, many of the large corporations that arose at this time - Ford, General Motors, and General Electric, for example - are still with us DATE. The vertical integration of these large corporations, in turn, led to a greater emphasis on nonproduction activities.NUM To compete in retail markets, firms needed to understand what products consumers wanted and to enable consumers to associate specific products with a particular firm; in addition, firms needed to establish accounting systems to keep track of a wider range of activities. As a result, marketing and advertising departments arose within large corporations, as did accounting departments. Also, with large corporations now more sensitive to their market share and their cost advantage over their competitors, they began to develop applied research departments to foster innovations in their industries. After World War II, changes in the organization of the firm took two forms. The first was an increasing tendency by corporate managers to split the firms' operations into separate divisions, each with its own manufacturing and marketing departments. This multidivisional approach was well suited to the technological changes of DATE and DATEs, as many innovations during that period led to the manufacturing of diverse product lines by a single company, DuPont and Monsanto being key examples.NUM This multidivisional structure also turned out to be an effective method of handling corporate operations in different geographic areas; and indeed, the second major organizational innovation during this period was the rise of the multinational corporation. After World War II, new trade agreements and efforts to revitalize Europe and Japan allowed American firms to make significant inroads into foreign markets. To handle these long-distance operations more easily, corporations often set up foreign subsidiaries that could adapt quickly to changing circumstances in the host country's marketplace. By one estimate, such multinational corporations accounted for nearly NUM percent of total U.S. corporate assets by DATE.NUM Organizational structure during the productivity boom of DATE has, in some respects, shifted away from the large corporations that dominated the U.S. economy during much of DATE. To be sure, the marketplace in many industries is still dominated by large, well-established firms. And in some industries - the financial services sector comes to mind - recent technological innovations have, if anything, increased the scale of business. But in other industries, intense global competition has motivated many corporations to narrow their focus to core production-related activities and to outsource other functions. Increasingly, these supporting firms are providing their services from overseas, taking advantage both of lower labor costs there and of the revolution in communications. At the same time, much of the rapid technological innovation in this period has occurred outside the large corporate sector, and the success of that innovation has boosted the pace at which new ventures are being created. For example, more than NUM,NUM new businesses were incorporated DATE, on average, in DATE, about double the pace of DATE.NUM Of course, as we know from the dot-com experience, many of these firms failed. However, many others either grew or were bought by larger firms better able to market and distribute the most promising innovations. Sources of past productivity booms: financial market change A third major ingredient in promoting the productivity gains associated with technological innovation has been a complementary set of innovations in the financial sector that have changed the financial landscape in ways that were especially appropriate to the predominate form of business organization in each period.NUM For example, before the Civil War, most nonfinancial business investment was financed internally with retained earnings, with capital provided by family or friends, or through partnerships formed with other proprietors. The chief exceptions were the canals and railroads, which were actively issuing stocks and bonds in the DATEs.NUM With the need for greater capital investments and the sharp increases in the scale of operations of many firms after the Civil War, however, businesses in other industries also began to look more toward external sources of financing. The main sources of funding in DATE after the Civil War were debt and preferred stock.NUM Debt often took the form of secured loans, in large part because investors were concerned about the informational asymmetries they faced in evaluating the bankruptcy risk of particular firms. In addition, the owners of many firms often preferred financing with debt rather than common stock because they did not want to see their equity diluted or their control of the enterprise diminished. Similarly, preferred stock, which reduced bankruptcy risk but did not dilute the equity of the owners of the firm, was often used when assets were insufficient to secure the loan. Thus, despite the prevalence of information problems, financial intermediaries were able to provide firms with external sources of funds, making possible the rapid buildup in the capital stock that took place in DATE. For example, the total value of bank loans rose from less than $NUM billion in DATE to more than $NUM billion in the early DATEs, a notable increase in nominal value during a time when, if anything, the aggregate price level was falling.NUM In contrast, DATE after World War I were characterized by an increase in the importance of equity markets. At the New York Stock Exchange alone, the volume of stock sales rose from NUM million shares in DATE to more than NUM billion shares in DATE.NUM And, by one estimate, the number of individuals holding stock increased from NUM,NUM in DATE to NUM million by DATE.NUM The rise in the public's interest in common stock occurred for several reasons. First, and probably most importantly, the profitability of large corporations during DATE was accompanied by an expanding middle and upper class that wanted to take part in the economic gains associated with the introduction of new technologies such as the internal combustion engine and the electric motor. As the main way to share in these capital gains was to purchase some ownership in those corporations, these individuals increasingly looked to invest their savings in the stock market. At about the same time, the informational problems that had constrained interest in common stock through DATE were being reduced. Rising demand from investors in DATE for information about railroad companies had led to the proliferation of newsletters watching developments in that industry, and similar publications soon sprang up to provide information on other traded securities. These newsletters eventually evolved into ratings agencies covering a wide range of individual corporations, with Moody's issuing the first bond ratings in DATE. Although these agencies' ratings focused on corporate bond issues, many also provided economic forecasting services and more detailed information about the relative risk of specific companies. In addition, with a greater recognition of the need to address investors' concerns about risk, more public companies regularly issued audited financial statements.NUM Interest in common stock was also boosted by the tendency to imbue them with characteristics similar to those associated with debt, with which investors were more familiar. For example, businesses frequently attempted to establish steady dividend streams in order to boost investors' confidence about the future profitability of the firm and encourage holdings of their securities. Finally, the marketing of securities to the household sector became more aggressive in DATE, led by investment trusts - which offered investors a means of diversifying individual portfolios - and retail brokerage firms. Given the relative prosperity of the post-World War II period, nonfinancial corporations were able to generate significant increases in internal funds. Even so, the growth of investment spending over this period noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the capital markets to fill the widening gap. In response, both bond and equity issuance rose rapidly in absolute terms, and the ratio of external financing to overall capital spending increased from an average of around NUM percent in DATE to more than NUM percent in DATE There were two specific developments in financial markets during this period that bear mentioning. First, DATE and DATE saw the rise of the Eurodollar",

                  "Edward M Gramlich: The politics of inflation targeting Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Euromoney Inflation Conference, Paris, DATE.    While many policymaking innovations have spread around the world from large nations to small, inflation targeting took a reverse course. It was first adopted in New Zealand in DATE, appeared to be successful, and has now spread to more than twenty nations. The regime is now being urged on the laggard countries that have not yet joined the bandwagon, notably the United States. The question of whether a country should adopt inflation targeting raises several issues. At the theoretical level, inflation targeting is alleged to promote central bank transparency, clarify communication, and establish a central bank commitment to price stability. These advantages are offset by the fact that inflation targeting could lead to rigid or formulaic policies that limit flexibility. Given the impossibility of rewriting history - trying to determine either what an inflation-targeting central bank would have done in response to some economic shock had it been a nontargeter or what a nontargeting central bank would have done had it been a targeter - the theoretical debate has never proved conclusive in deciding for or against inflation targeting. Nor is the empirical evidence conclusive. Econometric studies find that, in countries that have adopted inflation targeting, inflation rates have fallen, spreads between nominal and real interest rates have fallen, other measures of expectations of inflation have fallen, and macroeconomic growth numbers have not worsened and have often improved. From this point of view, inflation targeting looks to have been successful. But inflation rates have also fallen, nominal-real spreads have fallen, inflation expectations have fallen, and macroeconomic growth numbers have improved in at least one significant country that has not adopted inflation targeting, the United States. The general verdict of the many comparison studies seems to be in favor of inflation targeting, but something else, most likely the sheer commitment to price stability, has also appeared to have worked just as well in the United States. For countries that have not yet adopted inflation targeting, a key issue then becomes politics. The countries that have adopted inflation targeting report that the regime has helped to clarify the relationship between the central bank and the government, generally giving the government say over the ultimate objectives of monetary policy but the central bank freedom in how it pursues these objectives. But these are usually parliamentary countries where the governmental authorities have strongly endorsed inflation targeting. There is a large question about what a central bank should do in a congressional system, when its government has not endorsed inflation targeting. That is the issue I will discuss DATE. After reviewing present-day inflation-targeting relationships around the world, I turn my attention to political considerations for the United States. Present inflation-targeting arrangements The first country to adopt inflation targeting, New Zealand, did so with strong support and fairly specific instructions from its legislature. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act of DATE established the basic framework. This act gave the central bank the objective \"of achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices,\" with \"regard for the efficiency and soundness of the financial system.\" The act provided that the government and Reserve Bank jointly determine the specific inflation target and other policy objectives through Policy Target Agreements. The first of these target agreements defined price stability as a range of NUM percent to NUM percent in New Zealand's Consumers Price Index (CPI), set a goal of achieving price stability DATE hence, and gave conditions that could justify going outside the price stability band. Subsequent agreements have modified the target CPI, widened the tolerance band, and introduced other objectives, such as the stability of output growth. These modifications have generally made New Zealand's inflation-targeting regime much more flexible. Governmental involvement was still very important, though somewhat less explicit, for the next three inflation targeters. Chile's adoption of inflation targeting in DATE was preceded by new central bank legislation. Canada, which adopted inflation targeting in DATE, used the vehicle of a joint announcement by the Ministry of Finance and the governor of the Bank of Canada. This announcement, and subsequent joint announcements, established a target range for price stability but left the details, and the responsibility for policy, in the hands of the Bank. In Britain, which adopted inflation targeting in DATE, the chancellor of the Exchequer first announced the inflation goal. The Bank of England did not even have operational independence at the time. Though the Bank later gained independence, the chancellor still sets policy goals for the Bank through periodic remits. In the next wave of inflation targeters, there was less-explicit governmental involvement. In Sweden, which adopted inflation targeting in DATE, the government had previously announced that controlling inflation was an overriding goal for the Riksbank. In Australia, the Reserve Bank governor announced its inflation-targeting regime in a speech, using broad, previously delegated authority. In Norway, the Norges Bank operates under a governmental mandate declaring that the long-term objective of monetary policy is to maintain the domestic and international value of its currency. The European Central Bank (ECB) operates its regime under authority delegated by the Treaty Establishing the European Community, with the primary goal of price stability established by the treaty. Lessons are more diffuse from the last wave of countries to adopt inflation targeting. Brazil's adoption of inflation targeting in DATE was preceded by a presidential decree. Hungary and Poland adopted inflation targeting following parliamentary acts stipulating that price stability was the main objective for the central bank. But in two cases, Mexico and the Czech Republic, the central bank moved to inflation targeting on its own. In the Czech Republic, subsequent legislation enshrined price stability as the main objective of the central bank, but not in Mexico. Although these regimes differ from one another, there is at least some governmental involvement in all but the Mexican case. The level of involvement ranges from New Zealand's explicit governmental guidance to other, much more flexible arrangements that give the central bank fairly wide latitude in establishing target ranges, choosing indexes, and choosing time periods over which to meet the price stability objectives. There may also be a correlation between governmental involvement and the strictness of the inflation-targeting regime. Involvement has been the greatest in the strictest regime, New Zealand, and is noticeably less in the more flexible regimes. The United States The main country that has not adopted inflation targeting is the United States. Although academic economists and many others have for DATE been urging the Federal Reserve to adopt inflation targeting, legislators have shown very little interest in the issue. Congressman Jim Saxton of New Jersey, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has introduced an inflation-targeting bill several times, but the bill currently has no cosponsors and has not been reviewed recently in committee hearings. Previous inflation-targeting bills have fared no better. This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions. Given the absence of firmer congressional guidance, the Federal Reserve has continued to operate under the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of DATE. This act directs the Fed to \"promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" Should these goals be in conflict, it is up to the Fed to resolve the problem. To say the least, the U.S. approach is a rather stark contrast with the approach in New Zealand with its policy agreements and in Canada with its joint announcements. Academics and others urge the Federal Reserve to adopt inflation targeting, but should the Fed do so on its own? If the Fed does something on its own, how strict an inflation-targeting regime should it be? The politics of inflation targeting have never been fully explored. We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries. These targeting countries typically operate under a parliamentary form of government, under which the Treasury secretary or chancellor of the Exchequer is speaking for the whole government, both the executive and the legislative branches. There would be many more complications in the United States - the Federal Reserve would have to coordinate with the Treasury secretary, representing the executive branch, and members of the Congress. When the Congressional Budget Office deals with the Congress, it coordinates between both parties and both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Fed might not have to coordinate with both houses of the Congress, but it would certainly have to coordinate with both parties. This problem is not necessarily insuperable; all political actors might recognize the value of price stability and might appreciate inflation targeting, at least in its softer form. But at a minimum, political issues are much more complicated in congressional systems than in parliamentary systems. On a more technical level, there are at least two places to look for guidance. A first place is the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act itself. As amended, this act requires the Fed to make a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, accompanied by testimony from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. These reports and testimony have been occasions for the Fed to report on concepts and developments, though never one as significant as inflation targeting. It is hard to imagine the Fed's using these hearings to announce a full-blown inflation-targeting regime, though it is conceivable that the Fed could use them to propose soft target bands for price stability, or at least to get more specific about the Fed's commitment to price stability. But in the end, using the Monetary Policy Reports from the Fed as a means of getting the Congress to endorse inflation targeting would be stretching things. A second place to look for legal guidance is the fact that the Fed also has rule-writing responsibility for several statutes in the consumer area, such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act. In each of these cases, the statute was passed some DATE ago, and the Fed has responsibility for writing rules to keep the statute up-to-date. Periodically the Fed issues advance notices of proposed rulemaking, solicits comments, revises the rules, puts these revisions out for comment, and then adopts final rules. One could imagine a similar process for inflation targeting. For the Fed to write rules for a strict inflation-targeting regime on its own would presumably be impossible, though one might interpret \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" as an invitation for the Fed to write rules to institute a soft form of inflation targeting. On the whole, this precedential guidance is not very helpful. When it has had opportunities, the Congress has never moved ahead on inflation targeting, possibly because of outright opposition, possibly because of a desire for neutral non-involvement. Nor have various recent Administrations expressed much interest, preferring to leave such matters in the hands of the Fed. A Fed announcement about inflation targeting would be much more significant than the other more-technical and more-data-oriented announcements or pronouncements the Fed normally gives in its Monetary Policy Reports. And for the Fed to interpret the broad language of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act as an invitation to write rules instituting a strict form of inflation targeting would be an extreme stretch, though perhaps not for a soft form of inflation targeting. Normative considerations Granted that there is not much legal precedent for going ahead with inflation targeting on its own, would there be any value in having the Fed start a conversation with the Congress? Left to its own devices, the Congress probably will not move ahead on the Saxton bill or anything like it. But what if the Fed were actually to propose a soft form of inflation targeting? Such a proposal might change the dynamics and raise the possibility that the Congress could at least tacitly endorse inflation targeting. The advantages of soliciting congressional support for inflation targeting would be essentially those normally ascribed to inflation targeting in the first place. The Fed's announcements could become clearer and more transparent, its commitment to price stability could become more universally understood, and market participants could have a better idea of what specifically the Fed means by price stability. The present \"bias\" statement in the Fed's announcement of changes in the federal funds rate target could be supplanted with a statement on whether inflation is tending to the upper or lower bound of the Fed's price stability range. I see no particular need to clarify the relationship between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the United States - already there is agreement that the Treasury should be the only agency that comments on currency values, and that the Fed should be the only agency that comments on monetary policy - but added demarcations can never hurt. Another advantage would be that inflation targeting could assist in clarifying roles. When the Chairman testifies on the Monetary Policy Report, most of the questions involve an incredibly broad range of topics - fiscal policy, tax policy, entitlement spending issues, trade issues, and wage distribution questions. Many of these have little to do with the Fed's direct areas of responsibility. I can see a democratic effectiveness argument for rerouting these questions back to the area of direct Federal Reserve responsibility, and discussion of how to implement inflation targeting might well do that. These discussions might also make it clear that price stability - not all these other matters - is the primary economic outcome for which the Fed is responsible. As for the disadvantages, the most significant seems to be explaining why the Fed is specifically delineating only one of its three goals. A DATE macroeconomist would have no trouble in understanding why the Fed would put a target band on inflation but not on unemployment and not on long-term interest rates. In DATE macroeconomics, inflation is a policy choice variable - there is essentially no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and it is up to monetary policy to choose the long-run rate of inflation. Zero inflation, or close to zero depending on measurement error and other technical details, is as good as any other choice in promoting ultimate macroeconomic goals such as full employment and long-term economic growth. Keeping inflation close to zero has the further advantage of limiting the microeconomic costs and tax distortions caused by inflation. Hence a target zone for price stability fits perfectly into the standard macro model. But that's not true for the other parts of the Fed's mandate. Were the Fed, or the Congress, to set a target bound on the unemployment rate, that bound might not be consistent with the so-called natural, or non-inflationary, rate of unemployment. Were the target band, say, below the natural rate, the Fed would be forced to follow policies likely to lead to accelerating inflation. Similarly, a target band for long-term interest rates below the equilibrium long-term rate could also again force the Fed to pump money out to a highly inflationary degree. The difference is all in the way the macroeconomy works. The straightforward way to resolve this impasse is to try to explain it to politicians who remain skeptical. As evidence, one could use DATE and DATE as dramatic indications of what happens when macro policy violates the natural unemployment rate rule and the equilibrium interest rate rule, with rather dire subsequent inflationary consequences. Or the DATEs could be used as an illustration of how monetary policy could lower inflation, with concomitant gains in terms of full employment and long-term economic growth. Similar conversations might have occurred in all those countries where the government seems to have eagerly adopted inflation targeting. But these attempts to explain inflation targeting still might not work, and the Congress might still delineate specific unemployment and interest rate goals along with inflation goals. Were such to be the case, particularly if the specific goals for unemployment or interest rates were set inappropriately, as was done in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of the late DATE, I believe that even die-hard advocates of inflation targeting would consider the costs greater than the benefits. Given the already good inflation performance in the United States, the benefits of adopting inflation targeting are likely to be modest. But in an inappropriately constrained system, the costs could be enormous. Another potential political cost of inflation targeting involves loss of flexibility. As inflation targeting has evolved in other countries, and in the thinking of academic economists, a flexible approach to inflation targeting has proved quite popular. Specific goals for inflation are important, yes, but not under any and all circumstances. Real-world economies are subject to unanticipated shocks and unanticipated financial crises. Sometimes monetary authorities, even under inflation targeting, must respond to these shocks by going outside the price stability band for a short period. For example, the ECB has held its short-term interest rate at a low level for a significant period even though inflation has been slightly above its target ceiling most of that time. Many outside observers believe that economic sluggishness is the real problem in Europe and are quite sympathetic with the ECB strategy, even though it may violate a strict interpretation of inflation targeting. Most experts and others interested in inflation targeting understand this need for flexibility and are quite comfortable with flexible inflation-targeting schemes. In all likelihood, any scheme designed for the United States would feature such flexibility. So far there is no problem, but there could be at least a political awkwardness to such a situation. The Federal Reserve is responsible for many controversial policies - sometimes its approval or disapproval of bank mergers is controversial, sometimes its safety and soundness supervision is controversial, and sometimes its consumer protection regulations are controversial. At any point, some observers and some politicians are likely to be upset at the Fed for one reason or another. Were the inflation rate temporarily outside the target band, even for good economic reasons, the mere existence of inflation targets could be another excuse for tension between the Fed and the Congress. There is almost always at least potential tension between the Fed and the Congress, and both sides have learned how to handle it. But at least some danger lies in introducing new possibilities for tension. None of these supposed political costs of inflation targeting are certain, all could be readily handled, and it is at least possible that only vague congressional support for inflation targeting would ultimately be necessary. But we should recognize that same clarity of inflation targeting that has generally proved advantageous in other countries contains at least the seeds for potential disagreements in the United States. Conclusion All debates about whether the United States should adopt inflation targeting are fairly amorphous, balancing speculative theoretical considerations and imaging hypothetical situations. Given the good inflationary performance of the American economy in DATE, the question of whether to adopt inflation targeting has never been an all-out do-or-die issue. The most that pro-targeters have been able to claim is some possible benefits; and anti-targeters, some possible costs. In this amorphous debate, the political questions are perhaps the most amorphous of all. But surely it is relevant that, in other countries that have adopted inflation targeting, the parliamentary governments have generally been strong supporters, whereas in the United States Administration and congressional support has ranged from weak to non-existent. This lack of support could well change as the Administration and the Congress became more familiar with inflation targeting and, in particular, the possible flexibility of the regime. But if it does not change, or if it takes the form of inappropriate targets for other macroeconomic objectives, it becomes a definite impediment to the adoption of inflation targeting by the United States.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: The great moderation Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the Eastern Economic Association, Washington DC, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website. One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over DATE or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility. In a recent article, Olivier Blanchard and John Simon (DATE) documented that the variability of DATE growth in real output (as measured by its standard deviation) has declined by half since DATE, while the variability of DATE inflation has declined by about two thirds.NUM Several writers on the topic have dubbed this remarkable decline in the variability of both output and inflation \"the Great Moderation\". Similar declines in the volatility of output and inflation occurred at about the same time in other major industrial countries, with the recent exception of Japan, a country that has faced a distinctive set of economic problems in DATE. Reduced macroeconomic volatility has numerous benefits. Lower volatility of inflation improves market functioning, makes economic planning easier, and reduces the resources devoted to hedging inflation risks. Lower volatility of output tends to imply more stable employment and a reduction in the extent of economic uncertainty confronting households and firms. The reduction in the volatility of output is also closely associated with the fact that recessions have become less frequent and less severe.NUM Why has macroeconomic volatility declined? Three types of explanations have been suggested for this dramatic change; for brevity, I will refer to these classes of explanations as structural change, improved macroeconomic policies, and good luck. Explanations focusing on structural change suggest that changes in economic institutions, technology, business practices, or other structural features of the economy have improved the ability of the economy to absorb shocks. Some economists have argued, for example, that improved management of business inventories, made possible by advances in computation and communication, has reduced the amplitude of fluctuations in inventory stocks, which in DATE played an important role in cyclical fluctuations.NUM The increased depth and sophistication of financial markets, deregulation in many industries, the shift away from manufacturing toward services, and increased openness to trade and international capital flows are other examples of structural changes that may have increased macroeconomic flexibility and stability. The second class of explanations focuses on the arguably improved performance of macroeconomic policies, particularly monetary policy. The historical pattern of changes in the volatilities of output growth and inflation gives some credence to the idea that better monetary policy may have been a major contributor to increased economic stability. As Blanchard and Simon (DATE) show, output volatility and inflation volatility have had a strong tendency to move together, both in the United States and other industrial countries. In particular, output volatility in the United States, at a high level in DATE, declined significantly DATE, a period in which inflation volatility was low. Both output volatility and inflation volatility rose significantly in DATE and DATE and, as I have noted, both fell sharply after DATE. Economists generally agree that DATE, the period of highest volatility in both output and inflation, was also a period in which monetary policy performed quite poorly, relative to both earlier and later periods (Romer and Romer, DATE).NUM Few disagree that monetary policy has played a large part in stabilizing inflation, and so the fact that output volatility has declined in parallel with inflation volatility, both in the United States and abroad, suggests that monetary policy may have helped moderate the variability of output as well. The third class of explanations suggests that the Great Moderation did not result primarily from changes in the structure of the economy or improvements in policymaking but occurred because the shocks hitting the economy became smaller and more infrequent. In other words, the reduction in good macroeconomic volatility we have lately enjoyed is largely the result of luck, not an intrinsically more stable economy or better policies. Several prominent studies using distinct empirical approaches have provided support for the good-luck hypothesis (Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson, DATE; Stock and Watson, DATE). Explanations of complicated phenomena are rarely clear cut and simple, and each of the three classes of explanations I have described probably contains elements of truth. Nevertheless, sorting out the relative importance of these explanations is of more than purely historical interest. Notably, if the Great Moderation was largely the result of good luck rather than a more stable economy or better policies, then we have no particular reason to expect the relatively benign economic environment of DATE to continue. Indeed, if the good-luck hypothesis is true, it is entirely possible that the variability of output growth and inflation in the United States may, at some point, return to the levels of DATE. If instead the Great Moderation was the result of structural change or improved policymaking, then the increase in stability should be more likely to persist, assuming of course that policymakers do not forget the lessons of history. My view is that improvements in monetary policy, though certainly not the only factor, have probably been an important source of the Great Moderation. In particular, I am not convinced that the decline in primarily macroeconomic volatility of DATE was the result of good luck, as some have argued, though I am sure good luck had its part to play as well. In the remainder of my remarks, I will provide some support for the \"improved-monetary-policy\" explanation for the Great Moderation. I will not spend much time on the other two classes of explanations, not because they are uninteresting or unimportant, but because my time is limited and the structural change and good-luck hypotheses have been extensively discussed elsewhere.NUM Before proceeding, I should note that my views are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. The Taylor curve and the variability tradeoff Let us begin by asking what economic theory has to say about the relationship of output volatility and inflation volatility. To keep matters simple, I will make the strong (but only temporary!) assumption that monetary policymakers have an accurate understanding of the economy and that they choose policies to promote the best economic performance possible, given their economic objectives. I also assume for the moment that the structure of the economy and the distribution of economic shocks are stable and unchanging. Under these baseline assumptions, macroeconomists have obtained an interesting and important result. Specifically, standard economic models imply that, in the long run, monetary only policymakers can reduce the volatility of inflation by allowing greater volatility in output growth, and vice versa. In other words, if monetary policies are chosen optimally and the economic structure is held constant, there exists a long-run tradeoff between volatility in output and volatility in inflation. The ultimate source of this long-run tradeoff is the existence of shocks to aggregate supply. Consider the canonical example of an aggregate supply shock, a sharp rise in oil prices caused by disruptions to foreign sources of supply. According to conventional analysis, an increase in the price of oil raises the overall price level (a temporary burst in inflation) while depressing output and employment. Monetary policymakers are therefore faced with a difficult choice. If they choose to tighten policy (raise the short-term interest rate) in order to offset the effects of the oil price shock on the general price level, they may well succeed - but only at the cost of making the decline in output more severe. Likewise, if monetary policymakers choose to ease in order to mitigate the effects of the oil price shock on output, their action will exacerbate the inflationary impact. Hence, in the standard framework, the periodic occurrence of shocks to aggregate supply (such as oil price shocks) forces policymakers to choose between stabilizing output and stabilizing inflation.NUM Note that shocks to aggregate demand do not create the same tradeoff, as offsetting an aggregate demand shock stabilizes both output and inflation. This apparent tradeoff between output variability and inflation variability faced by policymakers gives rise to what has been dubbed the Taylor curve, reflecting early work by the Stanford economist and current Undersecretary of the Treasury John B. Taylor.NUM (Taylor also originated the eponymous Taylor rule, to which I will refer later.) Graphically, the Taylor curve depicts the menu of possible combinations of output volatility and inflation volatility from which monetary policymakers can choose in the long run. Figure NUM shows two examples of Taylor curves, marked TC1 and TC2. In Figure NUM, volatility in output is measured on the vertical axis and volatility in inflation is measured on the horizontal axis. As shown in the figure, Taylor curves slope downward, reflecting the theoretical conclusion that an optimizing policymaker can choose less of one type of volatility in the long run only by accepting more of the other.NUM A direct implication of the Taylor curve framework is that a change in the preferences or objectives of the central bank alone - a decision to be tougher on inflation, for example - cannot explain the Great Moderation. Indeed, in this framework, a conscious attempt by policymakers to try to moderate the variability of inflation should lead to higher, not lower, variability of output. How, then, can the Great Moderation be explained? Figure NUM suggests two possibilities. First, suppose it were the case, contrary to what we assumed in deriving the Taylor curve, that monetary policies during the period of high macroeconomic volatility were not optimal, perhaps because policymakers did not have an accurate understanding of the structure of the economy or of the impact of their policy actions. If monetary policies during DATE and DATE were sufficiently far from optimal, the result could be a combination of output volatility and inflation volatility lying well above the efficient frontier defined by the Taylor curve. Graphically, suppose that the true Taylor curve is the solid curve shown in Figure NUM, labeled TC2. Then, in principle, sufficiently well executed policies could achieve a combination of output volatility and inflation volatility such as that represented by point B, which lies on that curve. However, less effective policies could lead to the economic outcome represented by A point in Figure NUM, at which both output volatility and inflation volatility are higher than at point B. We can see now how improvements in monetary policy might account for the Great Moderation, even in the absence of any change in the structure of the economy or in the underlying shocks. Improvements in the policy framework, in policy implementation, or in the policymakers' understanding of the economy could allow the economy to move from the inefficient point A to the efficient point B, where the volatility of both inflation and output are more moderate. Figure NUM can also be used to depict a second possible explanation for the Great Moderation, which is that, rather than monetary policy having improved, the underlying economic environment may have become more stable. Changes in the structure of the economy that increased its resilience to shocks or reductions in the variance of the shocks themselves would improve the volatility tradeoff faced by policymakers. In Figure NUM, we can imagine now that the true Taylor curve in DATE is given by the dashed curve, TC1, and the actual economic outcome chosen by policymakers is point A, which lies on TC1. Improved economic stability in DATE DATE, whether arising from structural change or good luck, can be represented by a shift of the Taylor curve from TC1 to TC2, and the new TC2 economic outcome as determined by policy is point B. Relative to TC1, the Taylor curve represents economic outcomes with lower volatility in output for any given volatility of inflation, and vice versa. According to the \"shifting Taylor curve\" explanation, the Great Moderation resulted not from improved practice of monetary policy (which has always been as effective as possible, given the environment) but rather by favorable structural change or reduced variability of economic shocks. Of and course, more complicated scenarios in which policy becomes more effective the underlying economic environment becomes more stable are possible and indeed likely. With this bit of theory as background, I will focus on two key points. First, without claiming that monetary policy during DATE or in the period since DATE has been ideal by any means, I will try to support my view that the policies of DATE and DATE were particularly inefficient, for reasons that I think we now understand. Thus, as in the first scenario just discussed (represented in Figure NUM A as a movement from point to point B), improvements in the execution of monetary policy can plausibly account for a significant part of the Great Moderation. Second, more subtly, I will argue that some of the benefits of improved monetary policy may easily be confused with changes in the underlying environment (that is, improvements in policy may be incorrectly identified as shifts in the Taylor curve), increasing the risk that standard statistical methods of analyzing this question could understate the contribution of monetary policy to the Great Moderation. Reaching the Taylor curve: improvements in the effectiveness of monetary policy Monetary policymakers face difficult challenges in their efforts to stabilize the economy. We are uncertain about many aspects of the workings of the economy, including the channels by which the effects of monetary policy are transmitted. We are even uncertain about the current economic situation as economic data are received with a lag, are typically subject to multiple revisions, and in any case can only roughly and partially depict the underlying economic reality. Thus, in practice, monetary policy will never achieve as much reduction in macroeconomic volatility as would be possible if our understanding were more complete. Nevertheless, a number of economists have argued that monetary policy during DATE and DATE was unusually prone to creating volatility, relative to both earlier and later periods (DeLong, DATE; Mayer, DATE; Romer and Romer, DATE). Economic historians have suggested that the relative inefficiency of policy during this period arose because monetary policymakers labored under some important misconceptions about policy and the economy. First, during this period, central bankers seemed to have been excessively optimistic about the ability of activist monetary policies to offset shocks to output and to deliver permanently low levels of unemployment. Second, monetary policymakers appeared to underestimate their own contributions to the inflationary problems of the time, believing instead that inflation was in large part the result of nonmonetary forces. One might say that, in terms of their ability to deliver good macroeconomic outcomes, policymakers suffered from excessive \"output optimism\" and \"inflation pessimism.\" The output optimism of DATE and DATE had several aspects. First, at least during the early part of that period, many economists and policymakers held the view that policy could exploit a permanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, as described by a simple Phillips curve relationship. The idea of a permanent tradeoff opened up the beguiling possibility that, in return for accepting just a bit more inflation, policymakers could deliver a permanently low rate of unemployment. This view is now discredited, of course, on both theoretical and empirical grounds.NUM Second, estimates of the rate of unemployment that could be sustained without igniting inflation were typically unrealistically low, with a long-term unemployment rate of NUM percent or less often being characterized as a modest and easily attainable objective.NUM Third, economists of the time may have been unduly optimistic about the ability of fiscal and monetary policymakers to eliminate short-term fluctuations in output and employment, that is, to \"fine-tune\" the economy. What I have called inflation pessimism was the increasing conviction of policymakers in DATE and DATE, as inflation rose and remained stubbornly high, that monetary policy was an ineffective tool for controlling inflation. As emphasized in recent work on the United States and the United Kingdom by Edward Nelson (DATE), during this period policymakers became more and more inclined to blame inflation on so-called cost-push shocks rather than on monetary forces. Cost-push shocks, in the paradigm of the time, included diverse factors such as union wage pressures, price increases by oligopolistic firms, and increases in the prices of commodities such as oil and beef brought about by adverse changes in supply conditions. For the purpose of understanding the upward trend in inflation, however, the most salient attribute of cost-push shocks was that they were putatively out of the control of the monetary policymakers. The combination of output optimism and inflation pessimism during the latter part of DATE and DATE was a recipe for high volatility in output and inflation - that is, a set of outcomes well away from the efficient frontier represented by the economy's Taylor curve. Notably, the belief in a long-run tradeoff between output and inflation, together with an unrealistically low assessment of the sustainable rate of unemployment, resulted in high inflation but did not deliver the expected payoff in terms of higher output and employment. Moreover, the Fed's periodic attempts to rein in surging inflation led to a pattern of \"go-stop\" policies, in which swings in policy from ease to tightness contributed to a highly volatile real economy as well as a highly variable inflation rate. Wage-price controls, invoked in the belief that monetary policy was ineffective against cost-push forces, also ultimately proved destabilizing. Monetary policymakers bemoaned the high rate of inflation in DATE but did not fully appreciate their own role in its creation. Ironically, their errors in estimating the natural rate and in ascribing inflation to nonmonetary forces were mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, because unemployment remained well above their over-optimistic estimates of the sustainable rate, they were inclined to attribute inflation to outside forces (such as the actions of firms and unions) rather than to an overheated economy (Romer and Romer, DATE; Nelson, DATE). On the other hand, the view of policymakers that exogenous forces largely drove inflation made it more difficult for them to recognize that their estimate of the sustainable rate of unemployment was too low. DATE passed before policymakers were finally persuaded by the evidence that sustained anti-inflationary monetary policies would actually work (Primiceri, DATE). As you know, these policies were implemented successfully after DATE, beginning under Fed Chairman Volcker. Better known than even the Taylor curve is John Taylor's famous Taylor rule, a simple equation that has proved remarkably useful as a rule-of-thumb description of monetary policy (Taylor, DATE). In its basic form, the Taylor rule relates the Federal Reserve's policy instrument, the overnight federal funds interest rate, to the deviations of inflation and output from the central bank's desired levels for those variables. Estimates of the Taylor rule for DATE and DATE reflect the output optimism and inflation pessimism of the period, in that researchers tend to find a weaker response of the policy rate to inflation and (in some studies) a relatively stronger response to the output gap than in more recent periods.NUM As I will shortly discuss further, an insufficiently strong response to inflation let inflation and inflation expectations get out of control and thus added volatility to the economy. At the same time, strong responses to what we understand in retrospect to have been over-optimistic estimates of the output gap created additional instability. As output optimism and inflation pessimism both waned under the force of the data, policy responses became more appropriate and the economy more stable. In this sense, improvements in policymakers' understanding of the economy and the role of monetary policy A allowed the economy to move closer to the Taylor curve (or, in terms of Figure NUM, to move from point to point B). Improved monetary policy or a shifting Taylor curve? Improvements in monetary policy that moved the economy closer to the efficient frontier described by the Taylor curve can account for part of the Great Moderation. However, several empirical studies have questioned the quantitative importance of this effect and emphasized instead shifts in the Taylor curve, brought about by structural change or good luck. For example, in a paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole conference, James Stock and Mark Watson (DATE) use several alternative macroeconomic models to simulate how the economy would have performed after DATE if monetary policy had followed its pre-DATE pattern. Although inflation performance after DATE would clearly have been worse if pre-DATE monetary policies had been used, Stock and Watson find that output volatility would have been little different. They conclude that improved monetary policy does not account for much of the reduction in output volatility since DATE. Instead, noting that the variance of the economic shocks implied by their models for DATE was much higher than the variance of shocks in the more recent period, they embrace the good-luck explanation of the Great Moderation. Interesting research by Timothy Cogley and Thomas Sargent (DATE) and by Shaghil Ahmed, Andrew Levin, and Beth Anne Wilson (DATE) likewise find a substantial reduction in the size and frequency of shocks in the more recent period, supporting the good-luck hypothesis. Both the structural change and good-luck explanations of the Great Moderation are intriguing and (to reiterate) both are no doubt part of the story. However, an unsatisfying aspect of both explanations is the difficulty of identifying changes in the economic environment large enough and persistent enough to explain the Great Moderation, both in the United States and abroad. In particular, it is not obvious that economic shocks have become significantly smaller or more infrequent, as required by the goodluck hypothesis. Tensions in the Middle East, often blamed for the oil price shocks of DATE, have hardly declined in DATE, and important developments in technology and productivity have continued to buffet the economy (albeit in a more positive direction than in DATE). Nor has the international economic environment become obviously more placid, as a series of financial crises struck various regions of the world during the DATE and the powerful forces of globalization have proceeded apace. In contrast, following the adverse experience of DATE, changes in the practice of monetary policy occurred around the world in similar ways and during DATE. Certainly, stability-enhancing changes in the economic environment have occurred in DATE. However, an intriguing possibility is that some of these changes, rather than being truly exogenous, may have been induced by improved monetary policies. That is, better monetary policies may have resulted in what appear to be (but only appear to be) favorable shifts in the economy's Taylor curve. Here are some examples of what I have in mind. First, monetary policies that brought down and stabilized inflation may have led to stabilizing changes in the structure of the economy as well, in line with the prediction of the famous Lucas (DATE) critique that economic structure depends on the policy regime. High and unstable inflation increases the variability of relative prices and real interest rates, for example, distorting decisions regarding consumption, capital investment, and inventory investment, among others. Likewise, the high level, variability, and unpredictability of inflation profoundly affected decisions regarding financial investments and money holdings. Theories of \"rational inattention\" (Sims, DATE), according to which people vary the frequency with which they re-examine economic decisions according to the underlying economic environment, imply that the dynamic behavior of the economy would change - probably in the direction of greater stability and persistence - in a more stable pricing environment, in which people reconsider their economic decisions less frequently. Second, changes in monetary policy could conceivably affect the size and frequency of shocks hitting the economy, at least as an econometrician would measure those shocks. This assertion seems odd at first, as we are used to thinking of shocks as exogenous events, arising from \"outside the model,\" so to speak. However, econometricians typically do not measure shocks directly but instead infer them from movements in macroeconomic variables that they cannot otherwise explain. Shocks in this sense may certainly reflect the monetary regime. For example, consider the cost-push shocks that played such an important role in DATE' thinking about inflation. Seemingly unexplained or autonomous movements in wages and prices during this period, which analysts would have interpreted as shocks to wage and price equations, may in fact have been the result of earlier monetary policy actions, or (more subtly) of monetary policy actions expected by wage- and price-setters to take place in the future. In an influential paper, Robert Barsky and Lutz Kilian (DATE) analyze the oil price shocks of DATE in this spirit. Barsky and Kilian provide evidence that the extraordinary increases in nominal oil prices during DATE were made feasible primarily by earlier expansionary monetary policies rather than by truly exogenous political or economic events. Third, monetary policy can also affect the distribution of measured shocks by changing the sensitivity of pricing and other economic decisions to exogenous outside events. For example, significant movements in the price of oil and other commodities continued to occur after DATE. However, in a low-inflation environment, with stable inflation expectations and a general perception that firms do not have pricing power, commodity price shocks are not passed into final goods prices to nearly the same degree as in a looser monetary environment. As a result, a change in commodity prices of a given size shows up as a smaller shock to output and consumer prices DATE than it would have in the earlier period. Likewise, there is evidence that fluctuations in exchange rates have smaller effects on domestic prices and economic activity when inflation is less volatile and inflation expectations are stabilized (Gagnon and Ihrig, DATE; Devereux, Engel, and Storgaard, DATE). Fourth, changes in inflation expectations, which are ultimately the product of the monetary policy regime, can also be confused with truly exogenous shocks in conventional econometric analyses. Marvin Goodfriend (DATE) has suggested, for example, that insufficiently anchored inflation expectations have led to periodic \"inflation scares\", in which inflation expectations have risen in an apparently autonomous manner. Increases in inflation expectations have the flavor of adverse aggregate supply shocks in that they tend to increase the volatility of both inflation and output, in a combination that depends on how strongly the monetary policymakers act to offset these changes in expectations. Theoretical and empirical support for the idea that inflation expectations may become an independent source of instability has grown in DATE.NUM As I mentioned earlier, a number of researchers have found that the reaction of monetary policymakers to inflation has strengthened, in that the estimated coefficient on inflation in the Taylor rule has risen from something less than NUM before DATE to a value significantly greater than NUM in the more recent period. If the policy interest rate responds to increases in inflation by less than one-for-one (so that the real policy rate does not rise in the face of higher inflation), economic theory tells us that inflation expectations and the economy in general can become unstable. The problem arises from the fact that, if policymakers do not react sufficiently aggressively to increases in inflation, spontaneously arising expectations of increased inflation can ultimately be selfconfirming and even self-reinforcing. Incidentally, the stability requirement that the policy rate respond to inflation by more than one-for-one is called the Taylor principle (Taylor, DATE, DATE) - the third concept named after John Taylor that has played a role in this talk. The finding that monetary policymakers violated the Taylor principle during DATE but satisfied the principle in DATE would be consistent with a reduced incidence of destabilizing expectational shocks.NUM Support for the view that inflation expectations can be an independent source of economic volatility has also emerged from the extensive recent literature on learning and macroeconomics (Evans and Honkopohja, DATE). For example, Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (DATEa, DATEb) have studied models in which the public must learn the central bank's underlying preferences regarding inflation by observing the actual inflation process.NUM With learning, inflation expectations take on a more adaptive character; in particular, high and unstable inflation will beget similar characteristics in the pattern of inflation expectations. As Orphanides and Williams show, when inflation expectations are poorly anchored, so that the public is highly uncertain about the long-run rate of inflation that the central bank hopes to achieve, they can become an additional source of volatility in the economy. An analysis that did not properly control for the expectational effects of changes in monetary policy might incorrectly conclude that the Taylor curve had shifted in an adverse direction. Conclusion The Great Moderation, the substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility over DATE, is a striking economic development. Whether the dominant cause of the Great Moderation is structural change, improved monetary policy, or simply good luck is an important question about which no consensus has yet formed. I have argued DATE that improved monetary policy has likely made an important contribution not only to the reduced volatility of inflation (which is not particularly controversial) but to the reduced volatility of output as well. Moreover, because a change in the monetary policy regime has pervasive effects, I have suggested that some of the effects of improved monetary policies may have been misidentified as exogenous changes in economic structure or in the distribution of economic shocks. This conclusion on my part makes me optimistic for the future, because I am confident that monetary policymakers will not forget the lessons of DATE. I have put my case for better monetary policy rather forcefully DATE, because I think it likely that the policy explanation for the Great Moderation deserves more credit than it has received in the literature. However, let me close by emphasizing that the debate remains very much open. Although I have focused on its strengths, the monetary policy hypothesis has potential deficiencies as well. For example, although I pointed out the difficulty that the structural change and good-luck explanations have in accounting for the rather sharp decline in volatility after DATE, one might also question whether the change in monetary",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: What policymakers can learn from asset prices Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before The Investment Analysts Society of Chicago, Chicago, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    Central bankers naturally pay close attention to interest rates and asset prices, in large part because these variables are the principal conduits through which monetary policy affects real activity and inflation. But policymakers watch financial markets carefully for another reason, which is that asset prices and yields are potentially valuable sources of timely information about economic and financial conditions. Because the future returns on most financial assets depend sensitively on economic conditions, asset prices - if determined in sufficiently liquid markets - should embody a great deal of investors' collective information and beliefs about the future course of the economy. I thought you might find it interesting to hear a bit about how the staff of the Federal Reserve uses financial-market information to try to improve forecasts and help guide policy decisions. As you will see, asset prices provide information, particularly about market expectations, that is difficult to obtain elsewhere. However, a recurring theme of my remarks will be that extracting accurate information from asset prices and yields is more difficult and requires greater sophistication than is commonly supposed. Ongoing research in financial economics thus has great potential to provide practical assistance to monetary policy makers. As usual, the views I will express DATE are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.NUM Market expectations of inflation: the information in inflation-indexed securities I will begin by discussing what financial markets can tell us about inflation expectations. The inflation expectations of financial-market participants are of particular interest to central bankers, for several reasons. First, as price stability is a key objective of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve puts substantial resources into forecasting inflation. To the extent that financial markets serve to aggregate private-sector information about the likely future course of inflation, data on asset prices and yields might be used to validate and perhaps improve the Fed's forecasts. Second, inflation expectations are of interest to policymakers independent of inflation itself. A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or \"anchor,\" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, DATE; Evans and Honkapohja, DATE). Finally, knowledge of the expectations of inflation in financial markets permits the calculation of real interest rates, which are important indicators of both the condition of the economy and the stance of monetary policy. Although clues about inflation expectations abound in financial markets, inflation-indexed securities would appear to be the most direct source of information about inflation expectations and real interest rates.NUM Government securities whose realized yields depend on inflation, known on the Street as \"linkers,\" have become increasingly common in industrial countries, Japan being the latest nation to introduce an inflation-indexed government bond. The U.S. Treasury began issuing TIIS (for Treasury inflation-indexed securities), more popularly known as TIPS (for Treasury inflation-protected securities), in DATE. TIPS promise a yield-to-maturity that is guaranteed in real terms. To provide the promised real yield, TIPS coupon and principal payments are escalated based on increases in the consumer price index from the time at which the security was issued. The difference between the real yield guaranteed by an inflation-linked security and the nominal yield provided by a conventional security of the same maturity is known as the breakeven inflation rate or, alternatively, as inflation compensation. The top panel of Figure NUM shows the yield on nominal DATE Treasury bonds (top line) and the real yield on DATE TIPS since DATE (bottom line). The vertical distance between the two lines is known as breakeven inflation at the DATE horizon. The bottom panel uses overlapping issues of nominal securities and TIPS to disaggregate breakeven inflation into the rate that applies to bonds maturing DATE and the implied forward breakeven rate from DATE out. The breakeven rate of inflation is often treated as a direct reading of investors' expectations of inflation. Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of Figure NUM is an estimate of market inflation expectations over DATE, and the upper line represents DATE forward expectations of inflation, that is, DATE's expectation of what average inflation will be DATE. Unfortunately, as a measure of market participants' expected inflation, breakeven inflation has a number of problems (Sack, DATE; Shen and Corning, DATE). First, and probably the most important, breakeven inflation includes a return to investors for bearing inflation risk, implying that the breakeven rate likely overstates the market's expected rate of inflation. Estimates of the inflation risk premium for bonds maturing during the next DATE are surprisingly large, generally in a range between NUM and NUM basis points, depending on the time period studied (Ang and Bekaert, DATE; Goto and Torous, DATE; Buraschi and Jiltsov, DATE). If the inflation risk premium averages NUM basis points, for example, then breakeven inflation will overstate the market's true expectation of inflation by half a percentage point, a substantial amount. A further complication is that inflation risk premiums are not constant but instead appear to vary over time as economic circumstances change. Second, although the issuance of inflation-protected securities has risen significantly, the outstanding quantities of these securities remain much smaller than those of conventional Treasury securities. Moreover, TIPS are attractive to buy-and-hold investors, in contrast to nominal Treasury securities, which are extensively used for trading and hedging (Sack and Elsasser, DATE). For both reasons, the market for TIPS remains significantly less liquid than those for most Treasury securities. All else equal, the likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an underestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk premium.NUM Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further complicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation. A third issue is that the real values of the coupon payments on an indexed security are fixed by construction, while the real coupons of a nominal bond usually decline over its life. Hence, an indexed security typically has a longer duration with respect to real interest rate changes than does the nominal security, a difference that affects the relative riskiness of real and nominal securities.NUM More generally, because TIPS returns are imperfectly correlated with the yields on both nominal Treasuries and stocks, some investors demand TIPS for general diversification purposes - a demand that appears to have increased significantly as investors have become more familiar with this new type of asset. As the supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may push down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation.NUM A separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS returns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers are more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices. In fact, TIPS returns appear sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. NUM As a partial fix of this problem, the breakeven inflation rates shown in Figure NUM are calculated by comparing the yields of TIPS and so-called off-the-run securities. Within a given class of securities, say Treasury bonds with DATE until maturity, off-the-run securities are securities other than those most recently issued. Because off-the-run securities are less liquid than newly issued (on-the-run) securities, they provide a more appropriate benchmark against which to compare the yields of relatively illiquid inflation-indexed bonds. NUM As Sack (DATE) has pointed out, this difference in duration implies that the breakeven inflation rate may be sensitive to the expected profile of future short real rates or be affected by differences in risk premiums arising from different exposure to interest-rate risk. Sack addressed the issue of differing durations of nominal securities and TIPS by comparing yields on TIPS to yields on artificial securities constructed to provide the same pattern of real payments as a TIPS security, thereby eliminating the differences in duration noted in the text. He found, however, that the duration mismatch is less important quantitatively than differences in liquidity between on-the-run nominal securities and TIPS. NUM A number of technical issues, such as the lags in the inflation adjustment procedure, affect the relationship of breakeven inflation and expected inflation. One such potential complication arises if the tax rates applicable to the marginal TIPS investor and to the marginal holder of nominal government securities are not the same, in which case the equilibrium breakeven inflation level will be affected. Roll (DATE) discusses the effects of taxation on the breakeven inflation rate. BIS Review NUM/DATE As you can see in Figure NUM, breakeven inflation rates have proven surprisingly volatile over their short history. For example, when nominal Treasury yields swung sharply during DATE summer of DATE, DATE breakeven inflation moved sharply as well, declining about NUM basis points as the bond market rallied, then rising about NUM basis points when nominal yields came back up (top panel). This effect was seen also in inflation compensation at the five-to-DATE horizon (bottom panel), a rather counterintuitive result. What should we make of the volatility of breakeven inflation over DATE? One interpretation is that inflation expectations are not as well anchored as policymakers would like (see Bernanke, DATE, for additional evidence on this point). The fact that inflation compensation tends to react strongly both to releases of macroeconomic data and to unexpected changes in monetary policy (Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, DATE) supports this interpretation. Still, at this point I think we need to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions about the short-run behavior of expected inflation from the data on breakeven inflation. The fact that the volatility of breakeven inflation is so much greater than that of standard survey measures of inflation expectations (such as those collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for professional forecasters or by the University of Michigan for consumers) should give us pause. The responsiveness of breakeven inflation to what might be construed primarily as liquidity disturbances, such as the Russian debt crisis and recent bouts of mortgage hedging activity that roiled Treasury markets, suggests that variable liquidity premiums, together with varying inflation risk premiums, contaminate breakeven inflation as a measure of expected inflation.NUM I have emphasized some reasons to be cautious in interpreting breakeven inflation as expected inflation. Nevertheless, I expect that the usefulness of inflation-indexed securities as a tool for measuring expected inflation will increase over time. The liquidity of TIPS should continue to improve as the share of government debt issued in inflation-linked form continues to rise, particularly if the Treasury decides to expand the range of maturities of indexed bonds that it offers. Moreover, as I will discuss briefly later in the talk, our ability to model risk and liquidity premiums is improving, which will help us control for an important source of volatility in breakeven inflation. Finally, the universe of inflation-linked financial assets seems to be increasing, which will allow for fruitful comparisons and cross-checking. For example, futures on the CPI were recently introduced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Although these contracts are not yet widely traded, they may at some point provide useful measures of breakeven inflation out to the maturity of the shortest-term TIPS, thereby filling in an important portion of the term structure of breakeven inflation. Interest rates and spreads as leading indicators An alternative approach to extracting information from financial markets is to examine a range of asset prices and yields to determine whether they are useful as leading indicators of economic developments. Financial prices meet several key criteria for being useful leading indicators. As I already noted, asset prices and yields are inherently forward looking and thus may contain information about future economic conditions not evident in other series. Moreover, asset prices, unlike many data series, are available on a timely and continuous basis and are not revised. At least since DATE, when Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns (DATE) published their pioneering work, economists have noted the usefulness of asset prices in forecasting economic activity - though perhaps we should keep in mind Paul Samuelson's wry observation that \"the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions.\" Although many financial quantities have been used in forecasting (an index of stock prices is included in the official index of leading indicators), interest rates on various financial instruments have perhaps been most often cited for their value as leading indicators.NUM For example, in a DATE paper, Alan Blinder and I found evidence that the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate used by the Federal Reserve as its policy instrument, has significant predictive power for a variety of measures of economic activity. Various yield spreads have also been found to be informative about the future course of the economy. In DATE, James Stock and Mark Watson proposed a new index of leading indicators based on seven variables with exceptionally good forecasting track records up to that date. Among these variables were the spread between the DATE and DATE Treasury yields (the term spread), the yield differential between commercial paper and Treasury bills (the public-private spread), the change in the DATE Treasury yields, and the nominal exchange rate.NUM Thus, Stock and Watson found that two of the best seven macroeconomic forecasting variables were interest rate spreads, and four of the best seven forecasters were financial in nature. Of these variables, the term spread (also known as the slope of the yield curve) had been recognized for some time as a useful indicator of cyclical conditions. Figure NUM shows the historical behavior of the term spread (top panel, here measured as the DATE rate less the DATE rate), as well as that of the federal funds rate and the spread between commercial paper and DATE T-bill yields for comparison. The shaded areas indicate periods of recession as designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It is interesting that the slope of the Treasury yield curve has turned negative (top panel), at least briefly, at DATE before every U.S. recession since DATE (Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei, DATE). It has given only one false signal, in DATE, when an economic slowdown - but not an official recession - followed the inversion of the yield curve. The slope of the yield curve is potentially informative for several reasons. To some extent, it captures the stance of monetary policy. For example, when the yield curve is sharply upward sloping, as is the case DATE, one can usually conclude that monetary policy is in an expansionary mode (because the short-term policy rate lies below the average of expected future short-term rates). Either an expected pickup in economic growth or higher expected future inflation would also tend to raise long-term rates relative to short rates, steepening the yield curve. Evidence for the predictive power of the slope of the yield curve has been found for other industrialized countries as well as for the United States.NUM Although the evident information content of the term spread and other yields and spreads is intriguing, these variables - like breakeven inflation - hardly provide a foolproof forecasting tool. For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the DATE recession very weakly and rather late. The yield curve was inverted from June DATE through March DATE, which presaged the DATE recession, but other financial indicators (such as the public-private spread) missed the downturn entirely (Stock and Watson, DATEa), as you can see in Figure NUM. More generally, Stock and Watson (DATEb) have recently documented that simple forecasting relationships are typically quite unstable, presumably because both the nation's economic structure, the conduct of policy, and the mix of shocks that buffet the economy change over time. Although the use of financial data as leading indicators is not without risks, I suspect that economists will continue to try to find better ways to extract the information in these data. I see two general approaches as being especially promising. First, forecasting relationships that simultaneously use information from a large number of data series may be more robust than prediction equations based on only a few variables (Stock and Watson, DATEb). One effective way to summarize the information in large data sets is through the estimation of statistical models that extract the common information conveyed by many variables.NUM Currently, the U.S. Treasury uses a model of this type in preparing its forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP), and the Chicago Fed's national activity index, which draws on earlier work by Stock and Watson, is also based on these methods. The Board staff is currently investigating the potential of this approach for forecasting the economy. The other promising approach is to combine financial and macroeconomic information in a more structured way. For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (DATE) have used modern financial theory to construct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key interest rates. In particular, their framework incorporates the possibility of two-way causality, allowing for both interest-rate effects on the economy and the impact of economic developments on interest rates. These authors show that combining financial and macroeconomic elements in a single model permits better forecasts of both GDP and of interest rates than can be achieved through less formal methods.NUM Other work, for example by Ang and Bekaert (DATE), shows how modeling the links between interest rates and the economy may help us obtain more efficient forecasts of inflation. These methods are also being studied at the Federal Reserve Board. One important advantage of this theory-based modeling approach is that it permits the estimation of risk premiums. For example, presumably the predictive power of the term spread would be enhanced if we could separate changes in the spread resulting from changes in rate expectations from those arising from changes in risk premiums. Similarly, better estimates of inflation risk premiums would prove useful for adjusting breakeven inflation rates from TIPS to get more reliable measures of expected inflation. Market expectations of monetary policy What do markets expect about the future course of monetary policy? The question is important to policymakers, not because we are concerned necessarily that we should meet the market's expectations - such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors - but as a check on the efficacy of our communication. If the policy expectations of the market differ significantly from the policy expectations of central bankers, then the two leading possibilities are, first, that the policy committee has not accurately communicated its outlook and objectives or, second, that the market hears the policy committee's message but is skeptical of it. A number of financial instruments provide readings on the market's policy expectations. Two of the most useful are federal funds futures contracts and eurodollar futures contracts. These contracts are traded in highly liquid markets.NUM Moreover, by their nature they are closely tied to expectations of monetary policy changes, as both reflect rates paid in the interbank market, the market that is targeted by the Federal Reserve's open-market operations.NUM Implied forward values of short-term interest rates at various horizons can be extracted from federal funds and eurodollar futures contract prices in a straightforward way. Figure NUM provides an illustration. The lower, dashed line shows the path of the expected federal funds rate through DATE as implied by federal funds and eurodollar futures at the close of the market on April NUM, DATE, with an adjustment for the average level of term premiums. The upper, solid line shows the path of expected funds rates as of the market close on DATE, DATE. As you probably know, the payroll employment numbers announced on DATE significantly exceeded market expectations. Figure NUM shows that the payroll data seems to have caused the market to price in an expectation of a higher federal funds rate target over the entire policy horizon. Of course, that change in policy expectations is consistent with the significant rise in Treasury yields that occurred after the employment report. Observing market expectations of policy provides useful feedback to the policymakers. Yet again, however, caution is needed in interpreting these data. As with inflation-indexed securities, forward interest rates implied by futures contracts do not necessarily correspond to market expectations of the short-term rate, because of the presence of premiums for interest-rate risk.NUM Indeed, research suggests that risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures contracts are not trivial and may vary over time. For example, a study by Piazzesi and Swanson (DATE) has found that risk premiums on federal funds futures are both strongly countercyclical and predictable at longer horizons. The implication is that, although futures prices provide good estimates of market expectations of policy at short horizons of DATE, at longer horizons they can be misleading. In particular, Piazzesi and Swanson (DATE) find that if analysts ignore risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures, they will estimate longer-horizon policy expectations that \"lag behind\" actual market expectations, remaining too high when the Fed is easing and too low when the Fed is tightening.NUM Fortunately, this research also shows how to correct the futures data to account for the time variation in risk premiums. Once again, we see that some subtlety is required to extract the information available in asset prices. A great advantage of market-based measures of policy expectations, relative to periodic surveys that ask market participants about their expectations, is that market measures are available essentially continuously.NUM These measures thus lend themselves to \"event studies\" of two types, both of which are employed at the Board of Governors. The first type analyzes how various events, such as Federal Reserve statements; the release of TIME, testimony, or speeches by members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC); and macroeconomic news affect market expectations of monetary policy. One simply compares the implied policy expectations before and after the event being studied. We have already considered an example, the effects of the most recent payroll report, in Figure NUM. Analyses of this type provide insights for policymakers into the question of what economic factors the \"market,\" viewed collectively, is focusing on at a given time. The second type of event study uses market-based measures of policy expectations to analyze the effects of policy changes on the economy. In particular, when the FOMC chooses to set the target for the federal funds rate at a value different from that expected by the market, asset prices tend to react strongly. For example, in a recent paper, Kenneth Kuttner and I (DATE) studied the effects on stock prices of unanticipated changes in monetary policy, as measured by settings of the federal funds rate target that differ from those implied by federal funds futures market. We found that a surprise increase of NUM basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about NUM percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect on stock prices.NUM Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission. Policymakers are concerned not only about market expectations of output, inflation, interest rates, and other key variables, but also about the extent of market uncertainty about those and other variables. Financial data provide insight about market uncertainty that is obtainable nowhere else. For example, the Board's staff regularly analyzes the prices of options on eurodollar futures to estimate the degree of uncertainty that market participants have about monetary policy at different horizons. Indeed, by examining options with different strike prices, and under some reasonable additional assumptions, one can produce a full probability distribution of market expectations for the level of the federal funds rate at various dates in the future. Likewise, analysis of various types of options can generate distributions of expectations for economic and financial variables ranging from oil prices to the exchange value of the dollar to future stock prices.NUM Conclusion Financial markets aggregate enormous amounts of information and thus provide a rich hunting ground for central bankers trying to learn about the economy. Today I have tried to provide a small taste of the many types of financial data that are analyzed by the staff at the Federal Reserve as well as to give you some sense of the techniques that they bring to bear. A message that I also hope to leave with you is that some of the potentially most valuable information in financial markets often requires considerable theoretical and empirical sophistication to extract. For this reason, and as I mentioned at the beginning, financial research of the type being conducted at the Board, in academia, and in the investment community will prove invaluable to the Federal Reserve in our efforts to support a stronger and more stable economy.

Vice President Papademos, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to the fourth conference of the International Research Forum for Monetary Policy. The forum is one outgrowth of the increased interaction between central banks and academic institutions that, in my opinion, benefits both groups. It is a true joint effort involving the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve Board, the BMW Institute for German and European Studies at Georgetown University, and the Centre for Financial Studies at Goethe University in Frankfurt. You have a very full agenda for DATE. The topics represent a good mix of theoretical work as well as empirical work based on both calibration and econometric estimation. You are beginning with two papers that emphasize the importance of inflation expectations. Other papers examine such topics as the application of search theory, the functioning of mortgage markets, the theoretical analysis of optimal monetary policy, and empirical research on price-setting. There is a lot of intellectual food on the table. Bon appetit!",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Panel discussion: what have we learned since DATE? Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the Conference on Reflections on Monetary Policy DATE after DATE, Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, St Louis, Missouri, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    The question asked of this panel is, \"What have we learned since DATE?\" The evidence suggests that we have learned quite a bit. Most notably, monetary policy-makers, political leaders, and the public have been persuaded by DATE of experience that low and stable inflation has very substantial economic benefits. This consensus marks a considerable change from the views held by many economists at the time that Paul Volcker became Fed Chairman. In DATE, most economists would have agreed that, in principle, low inflation promotes economic growth and efficiency in the long run. However, many also believed that, in the range of inflation rates typically experienced by industrial countries, the benefits of low inflation are probably small - particularly when set against the short-run costs of a major disinflation, as the United States faced at that time. Indeed, some economists would have held that low-inflation policies would likely prove counterproductive even in the long run, if an increased focus on inflation inhibited monetary policy-makers from responding adequately to fluctuations in economic activity and employment. As it turned out, the low-inflation era of the past DATE has seen not only significant improvements in economic growth and productivity but also a marked reduction in economic volatility, both in the United States and abroad, a phenomenon that has been dubbed \"the Great Moderation.\" Recessions have become less frequent and milder, and DATE volatility in output and employment has declined significantly as well. The sources of the Great Moderation remain somewhat controversial, but as I have argued elsewhere, there is evidence for the view that improved control of inflation has contributed in important measure to this welcome change in the economy (Bernanke, DATE). Paul Volcker and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee deserve enormous credit both for recognizing the crucial importance of achieving low and stable inflation and for the courage and perseverance with which they tackled America's critical inflation problem. I could say much more about Volcker's achievement and its lasting benefits, but I am sure that many other speakers will cover that ground. Instead, in my remaining time, I will focus on some lessons that economists have drawn from the Volcker regime regarding the importance of credibility in central banking and how that credibility can be obtained. As usual, the views I will express are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. Volcker could not have accomplished what he did, of course, had he not been appointed to the chairmanship by President Jimmy Carter. In retrospect, however, Carter's appointment decision seems at least a bit incongruous. Why would the President appoint as head of the central bank an individual whose economic views and policy goals (not to mention personal style) seemed, at least on the surface, quite different from his own? However, not long into Volcker's term, a staff economist at the Board of Governors produced a paper that explained why Carter's decision may in fact have been quite sensible from the President's, and indeed the society's, point of view. Although the question seems a narrow one, the insights of the paper had far broader application; indeed, this research has substantially advanced our understanding of the links among central bank credibility, central bank structure, and the effectiveness of monetary policy. Insiders will have already guessed that the Board economist to whom I refer is Kenneth Rogoff, currently a professor of economics at Harvard, and that the paper in question is Ken's DATE article, \"The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an Intermediate Monetary Target\" (Rogoff, DATE).NUM The insights of the Rogoff paper are well worth recalling DATE. Rather than considering the paper in isolation, however, I will place it in the context of two other classic papers on credibility and central bank design, an earlier work by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott and a later piece by Carl Walsh. As I proceed, I will note what I see to be the important lessons and the practical implications of this line of research.NUM Central bankers have long recognized at some level that the credibility of their pronouncements matters. I think it is fair to say, however, that in DATE and DATE, as the U.S. inflation crisis was building, economists and policymakers did not fully understand or appreciate the determinants of credibility and its link to policy outcomes. In DATE, however, Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott published a classic paper, entitled \"Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans\" (Kydland and Prescott, DATE), that provided the first modern analysis of these issues.NUM Specifically, Kydland and Prescott demonstrated why, in many situations, economic outcomes will be better if policymakers are able to make credible commitments, or promises, about certain aspects of the policies they will follow in the future. \"Credible\" in this context means that the public believes that the policymakers will keep their promises, even if they face incentives to renege. In particular, as one of Kydland and Prescott's examples illustrates, monetary policy-makers will generally find it advantageous to commit publicly to following policies that will produce low inflation. If the policymakers' statements are believed (that is, if they are credible), then the public will expect inflation to be low, and demands for wage and price increases should accordingly be moderate. In a virtuous circle, this cooperative behavior by the public makes the central bank's commitment to low inflation easier to fulfill. In contrast, if the public is skeptical of the central bank's commitment to low inflation (for example, if it believes that the central bank may give in to the temptation to overstimulate the economy for the sake of short-term employment gains), then the public's inflation expectations will be higher than they otherwise would be. Expectations of high inflation lead to more-aggressive wage and price demands, which make achieving and maintaining low inflation more difficult and costly (in terms of lost output and employment) for the central bank. Providing a clear explanation of why credibility is important for effective policymaking, as Kydland and Prescott did, was an important step. However, these authors largely left open the critical issue of how a central bank is supposed to obtain credibility in the first place. Here is where Rogoff's seminal article took up the thread.NUM Motivated by the example of Carter and Volcker, Rogoff's paper showed analytically why even a president who is not particularly averse to inflation, or at least no more so than the average member of the general public, might find it in his interest to appoint a well-known \"inflation hawk\" to head the central bank. The benefit of appointing a hawkish central banker is the increased inflation-fighting credibility that such an appointment brings. The public is certainly more likely to believe an inflation hawk when he promises to contain inflation because they understand that, as someone who is intrinsically averse to inflation, he is unlikely to renege on his commitment. As increased credibility allows the central bank to achieve low inflation at a smaller cost than a non-credible central bank can, the president may well find, somewhat paradoxically, that he prefers the economic outcomes achieved under the hawkish central banker to those that could have been obtained under a central banker with views closer to his own and those of the public. NUM In focusing on three landmark papers I necessarily ignore what has become an enormous literature on credibility and monetary policy. Walsh (DATE, chap. NUM) provides an excellent overview. Rogoff (DATE) was an important early survey of the \"first generation\" of models of credibility in the context of central banking. NUM In another noteworthy paper, Calvo (DATE) made a number of points similar to those developed by Kydland and Prescott. The extension of the Kydland-Prescott \"inflation bias\" by Barro and Gordon (1983a) has proved highly influential. NUM Rogoff was my graduate school classmate at M.I.T., and I recently asked him for his recollections about the origins of the conservative central banker. Here (from a personal e-mail) is part of his response: [T]he paper was mainly written at the Board in DATE . . . It came out as an IMF working paper in DATE (I was visiting there), and then the same version came out as an International Finance Discussion paper [at the Board of Governors] in DATE . . . The original version of the paper . . . featured inflation targeting. Much like the published paper, I suggested that having an independent central bank can be a solution to the time consistency [that is, credibility] problem if we give the bank an intermediate target and some (unspecified) incentive to hit the target . . . I had the conservative central banker idea in there as well, as one practical way to ensure the central bank placed a high weight on inflation. Larry Summers, my editor at the [Quarterly Journal of Economics], urged me to move that idea up to the front section and place inflation targeting second. This, of course, is how the paper ended up. [Regarding the Fed], Dale Henderson and Matt Canzoneri liked the paper very much . . . many other researchers gave me feedback on my paper (including Peter Tinsley, Ed Offenbacher, Bob Flood, Jo Anna Gray, and many others) . . . Last but perhaps most important, there is absolutely no doubt that the paper was inspired by my experience watching the Volcker Fed at close range. I never would have written it had I not . . . ended up as an economist at the Board. BIS Review NUM/DATE Appointing an inflation hawk to head the central bank may not be enough to ensure credibility for monetary policy, however. As Rogoff noted in his article, for this strategy to confer significant credibility benefits, the central bank must be perceived by the public as being sufficiently independent from the rest of the government to be immune to short-term political pressures. Thus Rogoff's proposed strategy was really two-pronged: The appointment of inflation-averse central bankers must be combined with measures to ensure central bank independence. These ideas, supported by a great deal of empirical work, have proven highly influential.NUM Indeed, the credibility benefits of central bank autonomy have been widely recognized in DATE, not only in the academic literature but, far more consequentially, in the real-world design of central banking institutions. For example, in the United Kingdom, the euro area, Japan, and numerous other places, recent legislation or other government action has palpably strengthened the independence of the central banks.NUM Rogoff's proposed solution to the credibility problems of central banks does have some limitations, however, as Ken recognized both in his paper and in subsequent work. First, although an inflation-averse central banker enhances credibility and delivers lower inflation on average, he may not respond to shocks to the economy in the socially desirable way. For example, faced with an aggregate supply shock (such as a sharp rise in oil prices), an inflation-averse central banker will tend to react too aggressively (from society's point of view) to contain the inflationary impact of the shock, with insufficient attention to the consequences of his policy for output and employment.NUM Second, contrary to an assumption of Rogoff's paper, in practice the policy preferences of a newly appointed central banker will not be precisely known by the public but must be inferred from policy actions. (Certainly the public's perceptions of Chairman Volcker's views and objectives evolved over time.) Knowing that the public must make such inferences might tempt a central banker to misrepresent the state of the economy (Canzoneri, DATE) or even to take suboptimal policy decisions; for example, the central banker may feel compelled to tighten policy more aggressively than is warranted in order to convince the public of his determination to fight inflation. The public's need to infer the central banker's policy preferences may even generate increased economic instability, as has been shown in a lively recent literature on the macroeconomic consequences of learning.NUM The third pathbreaking paper I will mention DATE, a DATE article by Carl Walsh entitled \"Optimal Contracts for Central Bankers,\" was an attempt to address both of these issues.NUM To do so, Walsh conducted a thought experiment. He asked his readers to imagine that the government or society could offer the head of the central bank a performance contract, one that includes explicit monetary rewards or penalties that depend on the economic outcomes that occur under his watch. Remarkably, Walsh showed that, in principle, a relatively simple contract between the government and the central bank would lead to the implementation of monetary policies that would be both credible and fully optimal. Under this contract, the government provides the central banker with a base level of compensation but then applies a penalty that depends on the realized rate of inflation - the higher the observed inflation rate, the greater the penalty. If the public understands the nature of the contract, and if the penalty assessed for permitting inflation is large enough to affect central bank behavior, the existence of the contract would give credence to NUM Walsh (DATE, section NUM) reviews empirical research on the correlations of central bank independence and economic outcomes. A consistent finding is that more-independent central banks produce lower inflation without any increase in output volatility. NUM The benefits of central bank independence should not lead us to ignore its downside, which is that the very distance from the political process that increases the central bank's policy credibility by necessity also risks isolating the central bank and making it less democratically accountable. For this reason, central bankers should make communication with the public and their elected representatives a high priority. Moreover, central bank independence does not imply that central banks should never coordinate with other parts of the government, under the appropriate circumstances. NUM Lohmann (DATE) shows that this problem can be ameliorated if the government limits the central bank's independence, stepping in to override the central bank's decisions when the supply shock becomes too large. However, to preserve the central bank's independence in normal situations, this approach would involve stating clearly in advance the conditions under which the government would intercede, which may not be practicable. NUM Evans and Honkopohja (DATE) is the standard reference on learning in macroeconomics. Recent papers that apply models of learning to the analysis of U.S. monetary policy include Erceg and Levin (DATE) and Orphanides and Williams (forthcoming). NUM Persson and Tabellini (DATE) provided an influential analysis of the contracting approach that extended and developed many of the points made by Walsh (DATE). BIS Review NUM/DATE central bank promises to keep the inflation rate low (that is, the contract would provide credibility).NUM Walsh's contract has in common with Rogoff's approach the idea that, in a world of imperfect credibility, giving the central banker an objective function that differs from the true objectives of society may be useful. However, Walsh also shows that the contracting approach ameliorates the two problems associated with Rogoff's approach. First, under the Walsh contract, the central banker has incentives not only to achieve the target rate of inflation but also to respond in the socially optimal manner to supply shocks.NUM Second, as the inflation objective and the central banker's incentive scheme are made explicit by the contract, the public's problem of inferring the central banker's policy preferences is significantly reduced. There have been a few attempts in the real world to implement an incentive contract for central bankers - most famously a plan proposed to the New Zealand legislature, though never adopted, which provided for firing the governor of the central bank if the inflation rate deviated too far from the government's inflation objective.NUM But Walsh's contracts are best treated as a metaphor rather than as a literal proposal for central bank reform. Although the pay of central bankers is unlikely ever to depend directly on the realized rate of inflation, central bankers, like most people, care about many other aspects of their jobs, including their professional reputations, the prestige of the institutions in which they serve, and the probability that they will be reappointed. Walsh's analysis and many subsequent refinements by other authors suggest that central bank performance might be improved if the government set explicit performance standards for the central bank (perhaps as part of the institution's charter or enabling legislation) and regularly compared objectives and outcomes. Alternatively, because central banks may possess the greater expertise in determining what economic outcomes are both feasible and most desirable, macroeconomic goals might be set through a joint exercise of the government and the central bank. Many countries have established targets for inflation, for example, and central bankers in those countries evidently make strong efforts to attain those targets. The Federal Reserve Act does not set quantitative goals for the U.S. central bank, but it does specify the objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment and requires the central bank to present semi-annual reports to the Congress on monetary policy and the state of the economy. Accountability to the public as well as to the legislature is also important; for this reason, the central bank should explain regularly what it is trying to achieve and why. In sum, Walsh's paper can be read as providing theoretical support for an explicit, well-designed, and transparent framework for monetary policy, one which sets forth the objectives of policy and holds central bankers accountable for reaching those objectives (or, at least, for providing a detailed and plausible explanation of why the objectives were missed). In the simple model that Walsh analyzes, the optimal contract provides all the incentives needed to induce the best possible monetary policy, so that appointing a hawkish central banker is no longer beneficial. However, in practice - because Walsh's optimal contracts can be roughly approximated at best, because both the incentives and the policy decisions faced by central bankers are far more complex than can be captured by simple models, and because the appointment of an inflation-averse central banker may provide additional assurance to the public that the government and the central bank will keep their promises - the Walsh approach and the Rogoff approach are almost certainly complementary.NUM That is, a clear, well-articulated monetary policy framework; inflation-averse central bankers; and autonomy for central banks in the execution of policy are all likely to contribute to increased central bank credibility and hence better policy outcomes. Of course, other factors that I could not cover in this short review, such as the central bank's reputation for veracity as established over time, may also strengthen its credibility (Barro and Gordon, DATE; Backus and Driffill, DATE).NUM Let me end where I began, with reference to Paul Volcker and his contributions. I have discussed DATE how Volcker's personality and performance inspired one seminal piece of research about the determinants of central bank credibility. In focusing on a few pieces of academic research, however, I have greatly understated the impact of the Volcker era on views about central banking. The Volcker disinflation (and analogous episodes in the United Kingdom, Canada, and elsewhere) was undoubtedly a major catalyst for an explosion of fresh thinking by economists and policymakers about central bank credibility, how it is obtained, and its benefits for monetary policy-making. Over the past DATE, this new thinking has contributed to a wave of changes in central banking, particularly with respect to the institutional design of central banks and the establishment of new frameworks for the making of monetary policy. Ironically, the applicability of the ideas stimulated by the Volcker chairmanship to the experience of the U.S. economy under his stewardship remains unclear. Though the appointment of Volcker undoubtedly increased the credibility of the Federal Reserve, the Volcker disinflation was far from a costless affair, being associated with a minor recession in DATE and a deep recession in DATE-NUM Evidently, Volcker's personal credibility notwithstanding, Americans' memories of the inflationary DATE were too fresh for their inflation expectations to change quickly. It is difficult to know whether alternative tactics would have helped; for example, the announcement of explicit inflation objectives (which would certainly have been a radical idea at the time) might have helped guide inflation expectations downward more quickly, but they might also have created a political backlash that would have doomed the entire effort. Perhaps no policy approach or set of institutional arrangements could have eliminated the DATE inflation at a lower cost than was actually incurred. If so, then the significance of Paul Volcker's appointment was not its immediate effect on expectations or credibility but rather the fact that he was one of the rare individuals tough enough and with sufficient foresight to do what had to be done. By doing what was necessary to achieve price stability, the Volcker Fed laid the groundwork for DATE, so far, of strong economic performance.",

                  "William C Dudley: The case for TIPS - an examination of the costs and benefits Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Inflation-Indexed Securities and Inflation Risk Management Conference, New York, DATE.    Welcome to the New York Fed and to this timely conference on inflation-indexed securities and inflation risk management. Before discussing \"The Case for TIPS\", I would like to thank conference organizers, participants, panelists and supporting Bank staff for planning and putting together DATE's event. In particular, I wanted to thank John Campbell for his contribution to making DATE's conference a reality and I expect that his involvement will heighten attention to this subject and stimulate additional research from the academic community on the topics we discuss here. Over DATE, Treasury has been evaluating the costs and benefits of the TIPS program. Some research studies on this topic have concluded that the incremental financing costs associated with the TIPS program have been substantial; leading some to conclude that the costs may outweigh the benefits. DATE's program, which includes a panel discussion on the welfare benefits of inflation-protected securities, should help to broaden our knowledge on this topic. As the title of my speech suggests, DATE I am going to lay out the reasons why I, along with my colleagues Jennifer Roush and Michelle Steinberg Ezer, believe that the benefits of the TIPS program exceed the costs of the program. Before saying anything more, let me emphasize that the views I express DATE are my own and those of my co-authors and, therefore, may not represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Also, let me note that Jennifer and Michelle are the main authors of this paper. I have ridden along on their coattails. My main contribution was to slow down completion as I had to fit in my very modest contributions around the unfolding financial crisis! Finally, you may be wondering why this is my first speech since I have become president - an odd subject to choose, perhaps, given the ongoing financial crisis? The answer is a simple one, our paper and this conference have been in train for a long time. It is just a coincidence that the conference and my becoming president of the New York Fed have happened to arrive at about the same time. The logic of issuing inflation-protected securities is straightforward. Wouldn't some investors pay a premium - that is, accept a lower expected return - in exchange for guaranteed, full compensation for inflation? Because the United States and a number of other countries decided that the answer was likely to be \"yes,\" they developed an inflation-indexed government debt market. Has the program been a good development from the perspective of the U.S. Treasury? What about from the public's perspective? A good starting point for answering these questions is to account for the costs and benefits of the program relative to an appropriate counterfactual. For example, we might start by comparing the difference in funding costs to the Treasury of TIPS versus a program of comparable duration nominal Treasuries. But we should also be careful not to ignore other potential benefits of the TIPS program. As we see it, these potential benefits include:  the provision of a virtually risk-free investment that provides value to risk-averse investors,  access to a market-determined measure of inflation expectations that can help inform the conduct of monetary policy,  greater diversification of the Treasury's funding sources, which presumably has favorable implications for the Treasury's overall funding costs, and  the potential for TIPS issuance to reduce the variability of the U.S. government's net financial position and provide an explicit incentive for the fiscal authorities to conduct policy with an eye toward the consequences of inflation. Although it is difficult to quantify these benefits, we argue that they are meaningful and should not be ignored in evaluating the benefits of the TIPS program. Turning first to the issue of measuring the impact of TIPS issuance on the government's funding costs, this could be done simply by comparing the ex-post costs of a program of TIPS issuance to the costs of a comparable program of nominal Treasury issuance. Studies1 of this sort have typically shown that TIPS issuance has resulted in a higher net cost to the Treasury. Unfortunately, although this methodology is attractive in its simplicity, it has some flaws that undercut its usefulness in reaching conclusions about the attractiveness of the TIPS program. The problem with an ex-post analysis is that it depends critically upon the performance of inflation over the period in question. If inflation turns out to have been meaningfully different than what was expected at the time of TIPS issuance, then this difference - the so-called \"inflation surprise\" - can be important in affecting the relative costs of TIPS versus nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out to be higher than expected, then TIPS issuance will likely look to have been more expensive than nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out lower, an ex-post analysis will likely show a savings from the TIPS program. very Over the long run - and I mean the long run - there should be roughly as many downward surprises in inflation performance as upward surprises. But within any relatively short period, such as DATE, this certainly does not need to be the case. In other ex-post words, over such a short period, the outcome of an analysis can be heavily influenced by which of the two sides - the Treasury or investors - was the lucky recipient of the net inflation surprise that occurred over the period in question. For example, in countries such as the United Kingdom, where inflation declined following the inception of an inflationlinked debt program, ex-post studies generally suggest that these programs have reduced financing costs for these countries. The fact that the Treasury saved or lost money ex-post is thus not a very reliable guide as to whether the strategic decision to implement a TIPS program has been a good idea. The relevant question is whether the Treasury obtained the financing it needed at a lower ex-ante cost. If the experiment were to be run thousands of times drawing from the underlying distribution of possible inflation outcomes, would Treasury's costs have been lower, on average, with TIPS or with nominal Treasuries? To conclude on the basis of one coin flip or roll of the dice as ex-post analysis essentially does surely is not the best way to evaluate the respective costs of TIPS issuance versus nominal Treasuries. ex-ante Thus, we need to focus on the underlying factors that determine the difference in costs. There are two primary factors2 underlying the relative cost differences: NUM) the compensation investors require to hold a security that is less liquid than its nominal counterpart, termed the illiquidity premium, and NUM) the insurance value they attach to obtaining protection against inflation risk, known as the inflation risk premium. With regard to the first factor, when investors are worried about their ability to resell TIPS in a liquid secondary market, they require compensation for holding the securities compared with more liquid alternatives. This illiquidity premium tends to drive up TIPS yields and increase the Treasury's borrowing costs. The second factor works in the opposite direction. To the extent that investors are willing to pay for inflation protection, they would purchase TIPS at a price above that implied by their expected payment stream. As such, inflation risk premiums result in lower expected borrowing costs for the government and savings for the TIPS program compared with nominal issuance. To determine which factor has been historically dominant, we conduct an ex-ante cost analysis: We compare the amount that the Treasury received for inflation compensation at auction with an observable measure of the inflation expectations of TIPS investors that is not contaminated by premiums for inflation risk or liquidity differentials. Unfortunately, we don't have a perfect measure of expected inflation. Nevertheless, we may be able to get close. We do have estimates of expected inflation from other sources - such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. If such measures do indeed reflect the inflation expectations of investors, then we can conduct a reasonably accurate ex-ante analysis. TIPS analysts often talk about a concept they call the breakeven inflation rate. Essentially, this is the realized inflation rate that would cause investors to come out the same in terms of total compensation regardless of whether they had bought TIPS or nominal Treasuries. The difference between the auction breakeven inflation rate and the SPF forecast yields a measure of the net savings or loss incurred by the Treasury that is independent of forecast errors. It is also equal to the net value of the illiquidity and inflation risk premiums associated with each TIPS. Our analysis, which covers TIPS auctions through DATE, found that prior to DATE, the breakeven inflation rate was below the SPF. This indicates that the illiquidity premiums exceeded the inflation risk premium over this period. However, since DATE, we find that breakeven inflation rates were approximately equal to expected inflation, indicating that investors were roughly indifferent between the benefit of being protected against inflation risk versus the cost in terms of the greater illiquidity of TIPS relative to onthe-run nominal Treasuries. Thus, on an ex-ante basis, it appeared that the cost of issuing TIPS was about equal to the cost of issuing nominal Treasuries. To determine the impact of the illiquidity premium and inflation risk premium on these results, we decomposed our ex-ante analysis, comparing the breakeven rate of inflation excluding the illiquidity premium in TIPS yields3 to the SPF forecast. This comparison yields an estimate of the premium investors were willing to pay for inflation protection at previous TIPS auctions. We found an average risk premium estimate of NUM basis points over our sample period. This suggests that the TIPS program does satisfy a real demand that is not met by nominal Treasuries. It also suggests that if the Treasury were to take steps to shrink the illiquidity premium by, for example, improving secondary market trading in TIPS, this would shift the cost-benefit analysis more firmly in TIPS direction. A change in the TIPS illiquidity premium can have a notable impact on ex-ante cost analysis. For example, at the time this speech was written, the DATE TIPS breakeven rate was approximately NUM percent, compared to the SPF forecast of NUM percent. This is in contrast to the end of our sample period, which showed them to be about equal. This means that DATE TIPS issuance is not very compelling. But it is important to emphasize that this shift has occurred at a time when the preference for liquidity is especially strong, benefitting nominal Treasuries versus TIPS. When the market turmoil subsides and this illiquidity premium shrinks, one might expect TIPS to again move ahead on an ex-ante basis. So, at this point, the TIPS versus nominal issuance debate is inconclusive. But that's before we have included some of the other considerable - although more difficult to quantify - benefits associated with TIPS issuance. Let me now discuss some of these other benefits. Inflation hedge for households First, TIPS offer a benefit to investors because they have less risk than any other asset class. With virtually no credit risk or inflation risk, TIPS are one of the safest of investments.NUM For investors that want such safety, TIPS offer significant benefits. Furthermore, the ability for investors to choose the amount of inflation risk they hold may result in a more optimal allocation of risk among investors with different tolerances.NUM How much is this worth? Is the value of this completely captured in the relative interest costs of TIPS? Probably not, because the relative interest costs between TIPS and nominal Treasuries are set at the margin. We think there is some value in having a high-quality hedge to inflation risk, especially one that is available to less sophisticated investors. Improved monetary policy The second noteworthy benefit from the TIPS program is that it helps improve the conduct of monetary policy. Foremost, the program provides up-to-date information about the evolution of inflation expectations and real interest rates. Because keeping inflation expectations wellanchored is so important in keeping inflation itself in check, real-time measures of inflation expectations may lead to better monetary policymaking. This, in turn, should improve macroeconomic performance. Although this is very difficult to quantify in terms of value, I think it is safe to say that in a $NUM trillion economy, even a modest improvement in performance generates large dollar benefits. U.S. policymakers focus on a variety of inflation expectation measures, including private surveys of inflation expectations and market based measures, such as TIPS breakeven inflation rates. But in practice, the value of the survey-based measures is limited by the lack of timeliness - new data become available only DATE, DATE or DATE. Also, real money isn't riding on the accuracy of the survey responses. In contrast, the comparison between nominal Treasury and TIPS yields represents the consensus of market participants. For these reasons, policymakers rely importantly on the long-term inflation expectations proxied by the difference between nominal Treasury note and TIPS yields. So, how much is this tool worth? Of course, it is very difficult to say. Perhaps, we would flatter ourselves and think that we could do just as well without such a market-based, realtime measure of inflation expectations. But I doubt it. After all, inflation expectations, when untethered, are very difficult to re-anchor. TIPS help make it easier to keep inflation expectations in check. Improved fiscal policy The third less quantifiable benefit of TIPS is that the program may create incentives that can improve the conduct of fiscal policy. TIPS provide an explicit incentive for the fiscal authorities to conduct policy with an eye toward the consequences for inflation. The public's recognition of this incentive may help hold down inflation expectations and cause inflation expectations to be more firmly anchored. In addition, TIPS may give the Treasury access to a broader investor base, which also may reduce the Treasury's overall borrowing costs. The comparison between the prevailing interest rates on TIPS versus nominal Treasuries provides insight into the relative costs associated with issuing a marginal dollar of debt. But just as important is whether TIPS issuance, by displacing nominal Treasury issuance, reduces the level of interest rates that the Treasury pays on its nominal issuances. This would occur if TIPS were not perfect substitutes for nominal Treasury securities and if the demand for nominal Treasuries were downward sloping - that is, not completely elastic. The first condition almost certainly holds given the different attributes of TIPS versus nominal Treasuries. If they were perfect substitutes, then there would not be a liquidity premium for nominal Treasuries relative to TIPS. The second condition seems likely to hold since numerous studies have found that an increase in the net amount of Treasury borrowing leads to higher expected borrowing costs for the Treasury. How big might this effect be? That's difficult to estimate. A few studies6 have found that an increase in supply in a particular segment of the Treasury yield curve has contributed to a rise in yields. As a result, by issuing securities in a segmented TIPS market, the Treasury may keep realized yields on bill and nominal coupon securities lower than they otherwise would have been. The last noteworthy fiscal benefit from TIPS issuance is the fact that it reduces risk to the U.S. government in terms of the variability of its net financial position. The rate of inflation influences both the cost of TIPS and the government's tax receipts. Thus, some level of TIPS issuance may reduce the variability of the government's net financial position. This, in turn, should lead to a more regular and predictable pattern of issuance, which should help minimize interest costs. In summary, our analysis of the ex-ante costs of the TIPS program and the more difficult-tomeasure benefits suggests that TIPS issuance provides at least a modest net benefit to the Treasury. So, now I want to turn to a related question: Are there ways to increase the benefits? I would be willing to make two modest suggestions here. First, it may make sense to emphasize longer-dated TIPS issuance rather than shorter-dated issuance. Analytically, the logic goes as follows. Inflation uncertainty is likely to increase at longer time horizons. Thus, investors are likely to pay a greater premium for inflation protection at longer-time horizons. This implies that the cost savings associated with TIPS are likely to be greater for longer maturities rather than shorter maturities. This prediction is supported by empirical studies that have examined the premium that investors pay for inflation protection both in the United States and elsewhere. For example, a study by Brian Sack of Macroeconomic Advisors finds that forward breakeven inflation rates increase as maturity lengthens. In contrast, the level of survey-based measures of inflation expectations is quite constant beyond a time horizon of DATE. This means that the difference between forward breakeven inflation and inflation expectations climbs as the time horizon extends. This strongly suggests that the premium investors pay for inflation protection increases as maturities lengthen. Second, it may make sense to structure the TIPS program in a way that would help reduce the illiquidity premium associated with TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasuries. Some of the current illiquidity premium is likely to shrink as financial markets stabilize. However, further improvements may require a change in either the structure of the TIPS program or the secondary market trading environment. On that note, I leave you with two outstanding questions: NUM) What are the best ways for the U.S. Treasury and the trading community to improve secondary market liquidity in TIPS? NUM) Given that TIPS appear attractive for the U.S. Treasury, what is the optimal allocation of the Treasury's liability portfolio between TIPS and nominal securities? Thank you for your attention.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: John Taylor's contribution to monetary theory and policy Opening remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the Conference on John Taylor's Contribution to Monetary Theory and Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas (via videoconference), DATE.    It is a privilege for me to open this conference dedicated to our colleague and friend, John Taylor. John's influence on monetary theory and policy has been profound indeed. That influence has been manifest in undergraduate lecture halls and graduate seminar rooms, in the best research journals, and in the highest ranks of government. His ability to crystallize important analytical insights and apply them to policy issues is unsurpassed. Indeed, in a speech DATE, I noted three concepts named after John that are central to understanding our macroeconomic experience of DATE--the Taylor curve, the Taylor rule, and the Taylor principle (Bernanke, DATE). I'd like to take TIME to review John's career and impressive body of work. After receiving his Ph.D. from Stanford DATE, John began his career as an assistant professor at Columbia University. Even in DATE, John revealed his interest in applying the analytical tools of economics to practical policy issues. He took a leave of absence from academia in DATE to serve on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers. I suspect that the circumstances of DATE intensified John's motivation to help improve economic performance through sound policymaking. During DATE and DATE, John published a number of highly influential papers, including: \"Conditions for Unique Solutions in Stochastic Macroeconomic Models with Rational Expectations,\" \"Estimation and Control of a Macroeconomic Model with Rational Expectations,\" \"Aggregate Dynamics and Staggered Contracts,\" and \"Solution and Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Dynamic Nonlinear Rational Expectations Models.\" (As you can tell, John has always had a penchant for catchy titles.) Beyond its important technical contributions, this work showed that the insights and methods of the rational expectations revolution could be applied to models with sticky wages and prices. That observation has proved enormously influential in subsequent policy research. The rational expectations revolution helped to kill the idea of a long-run tradeoff between the levels of inflation and unemployment. However, John's analysis showed that, in the presence of aggregate supply shocks, attempts by monetary policymakers to reduce the volatility of inflation over time could be associated with higher volatility in unemployment, and vice versa. John's visual depiction of this policy tradeoff has come to be known as the Taylor curve. Interestingly, John's work anticipated the possibility that improvements in the conduct of monetary policy or changes in the structure of the economy could result in a shift of the Taylor curve--that is, a change in the ability of policy to smooth both inflation and employment. And indeed, what economists have dubbed the Great Moderation--a simultaneous reduction in the volatility of inflation and the volatility of real economic activity-has occurred in the United States and in many other economies over DATE. Over the course of DATE, John continued his work on rational expectations issues and monetary policy and macroeconomics more generally. He also began to broaden his focus to matters of international economics. He developed a multi-country rational expectations econometric model--a truly ambitious undertaking, especially in light of the limited computing capabilities of the era. By this point in his career, John had firmly established his reputation as a leader in the profession. In DATE, John became a member of the first President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. During DATE, he played a key role in shaping the Administration's positions on macroeconomic, fiscal, international finance, and trade issues. The U.S. economy was entering a difficult period at that point. Among other problems, significant pressures on bank balance sheets were beginning to emerge that would damp economic growth for DATE. While dealing with the serious economic issues of the time, John and the other members of the Council simultaneously produced an impressive manifesto for policymaking. They developed a rules-based approach to the conduct of monetary and fiscal Economic Report of the policy and published it in DATE in the President. That essay laid the foundation for what is perhaps John's most well-known contribution to economics--the simple description of the determinants of monetary policy that eventually became known as the Taylor rule.NUM John's analysis triggered an avalanche of studies examining the stabilization properties of Taylor rules in the context of macroeconomic models. Other work investigated the ability of variants of the Taylor rule to describe empirically the actual course of monetary policy in the United States and in other economies. The Taylor rule also embeds a basic principle of sound monetary policy that has subsequently been referred to as the Taylor principle.NUM According to this principle, when a shock causes a shift in the inflation rate, the central bank must adjust the nominal interest rate by more than one-for-one. This ensures that the real interest rate moves in the right direction to restore price stability. The Taylor principle provides essential guidance for central banks on how to anchor long-run inflation expectations and foster stable growth and low inflation. Ever since its inception, John has emphasized that the Taylor rule should not be applied mechanistically. The world is far too complicated for that. But he has argued that such rules can serve as useful benchmarks for the practical conduct of monetary policy. In fact, policymakers at the Federal Reserve and many other central banks do routinely consult various policy rules as they make judgments on the appropriate stance of monetary policy. After DATE at Stanford, John was called again to Washington by President Bush-this time the current President Bush. He served as Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Treasury from DATE through DATE. Our economy faced severe challenges during that period--the terrorist attacks of DATE, a recession and the threat of deflation, corporate governance scandals, and economic issues posed by the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Suffice it to say, John earned his stripes as the leader of the \"Global Financial Warriors.\" As detailed in his book of the same title, John worked extensively on the financial reconstruction of Iraq and on the development of financial tools for fighting terrorism. The Treasury Department recognized his efforts in DATE with its Distinguished Service Award and in DATE with the Alexander Hamilton Award for leadership in international finance. After his stint at Treasury, John returned once again to the less tumultuous life of a professor, ensconced in his offices at Stanford University and the Hoover Institution. I'm sure that, in between teaching and guiding the work of graduate students, he will continue to offer insightful commentary on monetary policy and other economic issues. And doubtless he will also continue to do pathbreaking research. Indeed, with our appetites whetted by the Taylor rule, principle, and curve, we now look forward to the Taylor dictum, the Taylor hyperbola, and maybe even the Taylor conundrum. Before closing my remarks, I would like to express my appreciation to President Fisher and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for hosting this conference. It is a terrific opportunity for celebrating John's contributions to monetary theory and policy. The papers on the program testify to the breadth and depth of John's work. I wish I could be there with you DATE to listen to the presentations and participate in the discussions. However, I know that you will have a productive and collegial gathering over DATE. And I wish all of you--but especially my friend and colleague John Taylor--all the best in your endeavors. References Bernanke, Ben S.

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Inflation expectations and inflation forecasting Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Monetary Economics Workshop of the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website. I would like to thank Christina Romer and David Romer for giving me the chance to address participants in the Summer Institute, sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). As an academic, I regularly attended the Summer Institute and presented or commented on research here. I also served for a time as the director of the Monetary Economics group, the position now shared by David and Christina. The informal nature of the institute, the large number of talented people in attendance, and the opportunity to hear about the very latest work in the field - often while in early draft form - made DATE each summer one of the most stimulating times of DATE for me. In my current position, I am keenly aware of the long history of fruitful interaction between economists inside and outside of central banks, and I am eager to see this interaction continue. This ongoing intellectual exchange, by improving our understanding of the economy and the workings of monetary policy, has had and will continue to have sizable benefits. DATE I will offer a few remarks on the relationships among monetary policy, inflation, and the public's expectations of inflation, focusing - as seems appropriate for this audience - on some important open questions. I will also give a short overview of the way the Federal Reserve Board staff forecasts inflation, including some discussion of how the staff incorporates information about expected inflation into its forecasting process. As you know, the control of inflation is central to good monetary policy. Price stability, which is one leg of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from the Congress, is a good thing in itself, for reasons that economists understand much better DATE than they did DATE. Inflation injects noise into the price system, makes long-term financial planning more complex, and interacts in perverse ways with imperfectly indexed tax and accounting rules. In the short-to-medium term, the maintenance of price stability helps avoid the pattern of stop-go monetary policies that were the source of much instability in output and employment in the past. More fundamentally, experience suggests that high and persistent inflation undermines public confidence in the economy and in the management of economic policy generally, with potentially adverse effects on risk-taking, investment, and other productive activities that are sensitive to the public's assessments of the prospects for future economic stability. In the long term, low inflation promotes growth, efficiency, and stability - which, all else being equal, support maximum sustainable employment, the other leg of the mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress. Admittedly, measuring the long-term relationship between growth or productivity and inflation is difficult. For example, it may be that low inflation has accompanied good economic performance in part because countries that maintain low inflation tend to pursue other sound economic policies as well. Still, I think we can agree that, at a minimum, the opposite proposition - that inflationary policies promote employment growth in the long run - has been entirely discredited and, indeed, that policies based on this proposition have led to very bad outcomes whenever they have been applied. Inflations expectations - conceptual frameworks Undoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation and thus the central bank's ability to achieve price stability. But what do we mean, precisely, by \"the state of inflation expectations\"? How should we measure inflation expectations, and how should we use that information for forecasting and controlling inflation? I certainly do not have complete answers to those questions, but I believe that they are of great practical importance. I hope my remarks here will stimulate some of you to work on these issues. What is the right conceptual framework for thinking about inflation expectations in the current context? The traditional rational-expectations model of inflation and inflation expectations has been a useful workhorse for thinking about issues of credibility and institutional design, but, to my mind, it is less helpful for thinking about economies in which (NUM) the structure of the economy is constantly evolving in ways that are imperfectly understood by both the public and policymakers and (NUM) the policymakers' objective function is not fully known by private agents. In particular, together with the assumption that the central bank's objective function is fixed and known to the public, the traditional rational-expectations approach implies that the public has firm knowledge of the long-run equilibrium inflation rate; consequently, their longrun inflation expectations do not vary over time in response to new information. But in fact, as I will discuss in more detail later, long-run inflation expectations do vary over time. That is, they are not perfectly anchored in real economies; moreover, the extent to which they are anchored can change, depending on economic developments and (most important) the current and past conduct of monetary policy. In this context, I use the term \"anchored\" to mean relatively insensitive to incoming data. So, for example, if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their long-run expectation, but their long-run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, then inflation expectations are well anchored. If, on the other hand, the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably, then expectations are poorly anchored. Although variations in the extent to which inflation expectations are anchored are not easily handled in a traditional rational-expectations framework, they seem to fit quite naturally into the burgeoning literature on learning in macroeconomics. The premise of this literature is that people do not have full information about the economy or about the objectives of the central bank, but they instead must make statistical inferences about the unknown parameters governing the evolution of the economy. In a learning context, the concept of anchored expectations is easily formalized in a variety of ways; in general, if the public is modeled as being confident in its current estimate of the long-run inflation rate, so that new information has relatively little effect on that estimate, then the essential idea of well-anchored expectations has been captured. Allowing for learning has important implications for how we think about the economy and policy. For example, some work has shown that the process of learning can affect the dynamics and even the potential stability of the economy (see, of many possible examples, Bullard and Mitra, DATE). Considerations of how the public learns about the economy affect the form of optimal monetary policy (Gaspar, Smets, and Vestin, DATE). Notably, in a world with rational expectations and in which private agents are assumed already to understand all aspects of the economic environment, talking about the effects of central bank communication would not be sensible, whereas models with learning accommodate the analysis of communication-related issues quite well (Orphanides and Williams, DATE; Bernanke, DATE). Macroeconomic models with learning also give content to the idea of an economy moving gradually from one regime to another, particularly if the central bank as well as the public is assumed to be updating its beliefs. For example, if the central bank and the public learn from experience that high inflation imposes greater costs and fewer benefits than previously thought, then the equilibrium will adjust toward one with lower inflation and lower inflation expectations. This line of explanation of how economies move between monetary regimes, which has been explored by Sargent and others, strikes me as quite plausible as a historical description (Sargent, DATE). In sum, many of the most interesting issues in contemporary monetary theory require an analytical framework that involves learning by private agents and possibly the central bank as well. Implications of anchored inflation expectations Why do we care about the variability of inflation expectations? As my colleague Rick Mishkin recently discussed, the extent to which inflation expectations are anchored has first-order implications for the performance of inflation and of the economy more generally (Mishkin, DATE). Mishkin illustrated this point by considering the implications of the fact that inflation expectations have become much better anchored over DATE for the estimated coefficients of the conventional Phillips curve, which I define here to encompass specifications that use lagged values of inflation to proxy for expectations or other sources of inflation inertia. As he noted, many studies of the conventional Phillips curve find that the sensitivity of inflation to activity indicators is lower DATE than in the past (that is, the Phillips curve appears to have become flatter);NUM and that the long-run effect on inflation of \"supply shocks,\" such as changes in the price of oil, also appears to be lower than in the past (Hooker, DATE). These findings are of much more than academic interest. To the extent that the Phillips curve may have flattened, inflation will now tend to be more stable than in the past in the face of variations in aggregate demand. (Of course, this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on whether inflation expectations are anchored in the vicinity of price stability.) Likewise, a lower sensitivity of long-run inflation to supply shocks would imply that such shocks are much less likely to generate economic instability DATE than they would have been DATE. Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over DATE have not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast (for example) to the U.S. experience of DATE. Various factors might account for these changes in the Phillips curve, but, as Mishkin pointed out, better-anchored inflation expectations - themselves, of course, the product of monetary policies that brought inflation down and have kept it relatively stable - certainly play some role. If people set prices and wages with reference to the rate of inflation they expect in the long run and if inflation expectations respond less than previously to variations in economic activity, then inflation itself will become relatively more insensitive to the level of activity - that is, the conventional Phillips curve will be flatter. Similar logic explains the finding that inflation is less responsive than it used to be to changes in oil prices and other supply shocks. Certainly, increases in energy prices affect overall inflation in the short run because energy products such as gasoline are part of the consumer's basket and because energy costs loom large in the production of some goods and services. However, a one-off change in energy prices can translate into persistent inflation only if it leads to higher expected inflation and a consequent \"wage-price spiral.\" With inflation expectations well anchored, a one-time increase in energy prices should not lead to a permanent increase in inflation but only to a change in relative prices. A related implication is that, if inflation expectations are well anchored, changes in energy (and food) prices should have relatively little influence on \"core\" inflation, that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy. Although inflation expectations seem much better anchored DATE than they were DATE, they appear to remain imperfectly anchored. A number of studies confirm that observation. For example, Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (DATE) found that long-run inflation expectations, as measured by the difference in yields between nominal and inflationindexed bonds, move in response to news about the economy, rather than remaining unaffected. Levin, Natalucci, and Piger (DATE) have shown that some survey measures of inflation expectations in the United States respond to recent changes in the actual rate of inflation, which would not be the case if expectations were perfectly anchored. Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, DATE; Rudebusch and Wu, DATE; Cogley, DATE). An indirect but elegant way to make the point that inflation expectations remain imperfectly anchored comes from a statistical analysis of inflation by Stock and Watson (DATE). Stock and Watson model inflation as having two components, which may be interpreted as the trend and the cycle. Changes in the trend component are highly persistent whereas shocks to the cyclical component are temporary.NUM The key finding of this research is that the variability of the trend component of inflation (and thus the share of the overall variability of inflation that it can explain) appears to have fallen significantly after DATE. That is, unexpected changes in inflation are DATE much more likely to be transitory than they were before DATE. Because it seems quite unlikely that changes in inflation could persist indefinitely unless long-run expectations of inflation also changed, I interpret the StockWatson finding as consistent with the view that inflation expectations have become much more anchored since DATE. At the same time, that the variability of the trend component of inflation, though modest, remains positive, implies that long-run expectations of inflation are not perfectly anchored DATE. The policy implications of the much-improved but still imperfect anchoring of inflation expectations are not at all straightforward. To evaluate these implications, we must understand better the historical variation in inflation expectations, the effect of this variation on actual inflation and economic activity, and the relationship between policy actions and the formation of inflation expectations. With the hope of promoting progress on these broad topics, I pose three questions to researchers, the answer to any of which would be quite useful for practical policymaking. First, how should the central bank best monitor the public's inflation expectations? Theoretical treatments tend to neglect the fact that in practice many measures of inflation expectations exist, including the forecasts of professional economists, results from surveys of consumers, information extracted from financial markets such as the market for inflationindexed debt, and limited information on firms' pricing plans. In a very interesting paper, Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers (DATE) compared the available measures, emphasizing in particular that median measures of inflation expectations often obscure substantial crosssectional dispersion of expectations.NUM On which measure or combination of measures should central bankers focus to assess inflation developments and the degree to which expectations are anchored? Do we need new measures of expectations or new surveys? Information on the price expectations of businesses - who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance - as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce. Second, how do changes in various measures of inflation expectations feed through to actual pricing behavior? Promising recent research has looked at price changes at very disaggregated levels for insight into the pricing decision (Bils and Klenow, DATE; Nakamura and Steinsson, DATE). But this research has not yet linked pricing decisions at the microeconomic level to inflation expectations; undertaking that next step would no doubt be difficult but also very valuable. Third, what factors affect the level of inflation expectations and the degree to which they are anchored? Answering this question essentially involves estimating the learning rule followed by the public or various components of the public, although one could consider alternative frameworks like Carroll's (DATE) epidemiological model of the propagation of information among private agents. A fuller understanding of the public's learning rules would improve the central bank's capacity to assess its own credibility, to evaluate the implications of its policy decisions and communications strategy, and perhaps to forecast inflation. Realistically calibrated models with learning would also inform our thinking about policy and the economy. Inflation forecasting at the Federal Reserve I would like to shift gears at this point to tell you a bit about how the Federal Reserve Board staff goes about forecasting inflation. Obviously, this activity provides critical inputs into the making of monetary policy, and as I will discuss, the staff's long-term track record in forecasting inflation is quite good by any reasonable benchmark. I hope that my brief description will stimulate your interest in the complex and challenging problems of real-time macroeconomic forecasting. But, as you will see, the discussion of practical inflation forecasting will bring us back to one theme of my remarks - that our ability to forecast inflation and predict how inflation will respond to policy actions depends very much on our capacity to measure and to understand what determines the public's expectations of inflation. The Board staff employs a variety of formal models, both structural and purely statistical, in its forecasting efforts. However, the forecasts of inflation (and of other key macroeconomic variables) that are provided to the Federal Open Market Committee are developed through an eclectic process that combines model-based projections, anecdotal and other \"extramodel\" information, and professional judgment. In short, for all the advances that have been made in modeling and statistical analysis, practical forecasting continues to involve art as well as science. The forecasting procedures used depend importantly on the forecast horizon. For near-term inflation forecasting - say, for DATE and the next - the staff relies most heavily on a disaggregated, bottom-up approach that focuses on estimating and forecasting price behavior for the various categories of goods and services that make up the aggregate price index in question. For example, we know from historical experience that the prices of some types of goods and services tend to be quite volatile, including not only (as is well known) the prices of energy and some types of food but also some \"core\" prices such as airfares, apparel prices, and hotel rates. The DATE autocorrelations of price changes in these categories tend to be low or even negative. In contrast, changes in inflation rates in some services categories, such as shelter costs, tend to be more persistent. In assessing what price changes in a particular category imply for future price changes in that category, the staff uses not only various forms of time-series analysis but also specialized knowledge about how the various indexes are constructed - for example, whether certain categories are sampled DATE in all localities and how DATE adjustments are performed. In making very near-term price forecasts, the staff also uses diverse information from a variety of sources, such as surveys of prices of gasoline and other important items, news reports about price-change announcements, and anecdotal information from our business contacts. Conceptually, one might think of this effort to distinguish transitory from persistent price changes as a more nuanced way of estimating the underlying inflation trend, analogous to the trend measures provided by more mechanical indicators such as trimmed-mean or weighted-median inflation rates. An accurate forecast of very near-term inflation is important not only for its own sake but also because it provides a better \"jumping-off point\" for the longer-term forecast. Because inflation continues to exhibit some inertia, improved near-term forecasts translate into more-accurate longer-term projections as well. For forecasting horizons beyond DATE two, detailed analyses of individual price components become less useful, and thus the staff's emphasis shifts to inflation's fundamental determinants. Food and energy inflation are forecasted separately from the core, using information from futures prices and other sources. However, forecasts of core inflation must take into account the extent to which food and energy costs are passed through to other prices. To project core inflation at longer-term horizons, the staff consults a range of econometric models. Most of the models used are based on versions of the new Keynesian Phillips curve, which links inflation to inflation expectations, the extent of economic slack, and indicators of supply shocks. Despite the common conceptual framework, the model specifications employed differ considerably in their details, including how lagged inflation enters the equation, how resource utilization is measured, and whether a survey-based measure of inflation expectations is included. In principle, formal econometric tests could determine how much weight should be put on the forecast of each model, but in practice the data do not permit sharp inferences; moreover, estimated forecasting equations may not reflect information about special factors affecting the outlook. Because of these considerations, as I have already noted, the staff's inflation forecasts inevitably reflect a substantial degree of expert judgment and the use of information not captured by the models. Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending. Achieving this consistency requires a thoughtful understanding of why sectoral forecasts may be at odds and how best to reconcile those differences. Again, in principle, consistency of sectoral forecasts could be ensured by estimating the inflation equation as part of a general equilibrium system. Indeed, considerable progress has been made in DATE, at the Board and elsewhere, in developing dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models detailed enough for policy application. These models have become increasingly useful for policy analysis and for the simulation of alternative scenarios. They are likely to play a more significant role in the forecasting process over time as well, though, like other formal methods, they are unlikely to displace expert judgment. A potential drawback of the simple Phillips curve model for analyzing and forecasting inflation is that it does not explicitly incorporate the possible influence of labor costs on the inflation process. The Board's large macroeconomic simulation model, known as FRB/US, projects inflation through a system approach that captures the interaction of wage and price determination. Interestingly, however, the system approach does not seem to forecast price inflation as well as single-equation Phillips curve models do. This weaker performance appears to reflect, at least in part, the shortcomings of the available data on labor compensation. The two principal DATE indicators of aggregate TIME compensation are the employment cost index (ECI) and nonfarm compensation per hour (CPH). Both are imperfect measures of the labor costs relevant to pricing decisions. For example, the ECI's fixed employment and occupation weights may not reflect changes in the labor market, and the ECI excludes stock options and similar forms of payment. CPH is volatile, perhaps in part because it measures stock options at exercise rather than when granted, and it is subject to substantial revisions. Moreover, these two TIME compensation measures often give contradictory signals. Despite these problems, labor market developments certainly influence how the staff and policymakers view the inflation process and inflation risks, illustrating yet another point in the forecasting process at which judgment must play an important role. In particular, in evaluating labor-market conditions and trends in labor costs, the staff takes note of a wide range of data, anecdotes, and other qualitative information as well as the official data on compensation. Overall, the Board staff's inflation forecasting has been remarkably good, at least compared with the available alternatives (Romer and Romer, DATE; Sims, DATE). To cite a recent study, Faust and Wright (DATE) show that real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons and that this advantage is not solely the result of the staff's expertise at estimating near-term inflation rates. To link this discussion of forecasting to the first portion of my remarks, I turn to the treatment of inflation expectations in staff forecasts. As I noted earlier, while inflation expectations doubtless are crucial determinants of observed inflation, measuring expectations and inferring just how they affect inflation are difficult tasks. A popular shortcut is to include lagged inflation terms in the Phillips curve equation; besides being a convenient means of capturing the inertial component in inflation, the estimated coefficients on lagged inflation almost certainly reflect to some degree the formation of inflation expectations and their influence on the inflation process. However, using lagged inflation as a proxy for inflation expectations has drawbacks, notably its susceptibility to the Lucas critique.NUM The staff consequently analyzes a number of survey measures of inflation expectations. One question in choosing among measures of expectations is whether to focus on measures of short-term inflation expectations (say, DATE) or of longer-term expectations (DATE). Generally, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the five-toten-year expected inflation measures from the Michigan/Reuters survey of households and from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, seem to be better gauges of the expectations that influence wage- and price-setting behavior. The staff also looks at measures derived from comparing yields on nominal and inflationindexed Treasury securities (the breakeven inflation rate). Measures of inflation compensation derived from the market for inflation-indexed securities are influenced by changes in inflation risk premiums and liquidity premiums, and analyses are constrained by the fact that these markets have been operating in the United States for only a relatively short period. Nevertheless, unlike survey measures, breakeven inflation rates are determined in a market in which investors back their views with real money. Moreover, breakeven measures of inflation expectations provide information on the expectations of a different group of agents - financial-market participants - which can be compared with the views of economists and consumers as represented by surveys. Measurement is only one aspect of understanding inflation expectations. We also need a better understanding of how inflation expectations affect actual inflation and of the factors that determine inflation expectations. I will say a few words about the latter issue in the context of the practical problems of forecasting and policy analysis faced by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board. Model-based simulations of the inflation process are useful tools for both forecasting and policy analysis. In conducting such simulations, the analyst must specify how inflation expectations are formed - in particular, how they react to actual changes in the economy and in policy. In most simulations of the FRB/US model, the public is assumed to update its inflation projections based on the historical relationship between inflation and other key economic variables. Essentially, this approach assumes that the public updates its inflation expectations in a sensible way based on economic developments but does not assume that the public has full knowledge of the underlying model of the economy, consistent with the structure of learning models (Brayton and others, DATE). Recent staff work at the Board has analyzed the implications of expanding the set of variables allowed to influence the public's long-term inflation expectations to include, among others, the federal funds rate.NUM If the public's long-term inflation expectations are influenced directly by Fed actions, as this specification suggests, a number of interesting implications follow. One is that the output costs of disinflation may be lower than those suggested by reduced-form-type Phillips curves. Intuitively, if the Fed attempts to disinflate by raising the federal funds rate, the disinflationary effect will be felt not only through the usual output gap channel but also through a direct restraint on long-term inflation expectations. This interpretation is consistent with some analyses of the Volcker disinflation; although the costs of that disinflation were high, they were perhaps less than economists would have predicted in advance, given conventional estimates of the sacrifice ratio (Erceg and Levin, DATE). To be sure, this and similar analyses remain speculative. A good deal more must be done before such work proves a reliable basis for policy choices. Nevertheless, I hope this example illustrates for you the theme of my remarks, that a deeper understanding of the determinants and effects of the public's expectations of inflation could have significant practical payoffs.

                  "Donald L Kohn: John Taylor rules Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Conference on John Taylor's Contributions to Monetary Theory and Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    The role of simple rules in monetary policymaking It is a pleasure and an honor to speak at this conference honoring John Taylor and his contributions to monetary theory and policy. As you have already heard from Chairman Bernanke and the other speakers DATE, John has made a number of seminal contributions to the field of macroeconomics. What has distinguished John's work, in my view, is that he takes policymaking in the real world seriously.NUM Taking policymaking seriously involves understanding the constraints imposed on our decisions by partial information and incomplete knowledge of economic relationships. It also implies the use of empirically valid models that acknowledge the efforts of households and businesses to anticipate the future and maximize their welfare over time. In DATE and DATE, macroeconomics was focused mainly on real business cycles and endogenous growth theory. During this period, John was one of a very small number of academic economists who continued to pursue research aimed at informing the conduct of monetary policy. John's Carnegie Rochester conference paper published in DATE is an excellent example of this research. Importantly, John's legacy to the Federal Reserve has not been confined to enhancing our understanding of monetary policy. In addition, he has turned out legions of students who have followed in his footsteps in their interest in policy. Many of them have spent time in the Federal Reserve, producing a rich array of contributions to policymaking and research. John and I have spent countless TIME discussing how the Federal Reserve arrives at decisions about monetary policy and how it should arrive at decisions. Those conversations began in earnest in DATE, when John was on the Council of Economic Advisers, and they have continued to DATE. They have occurred not only in offices and classrooms in Washington and Stanford and at numerous conferences around the globe, but also around dinner tables in Washington and Palo Alto and on hiking trails from Vermont to Wyoming. Those conversations made me a better policy adviser and then policymaker, and they have had the added and very special bonus of allowing Gail and me to count John and Allyn among our friends. I can't think of a better way to honor John's contributions than to continue that discussion around the dinner tables of Dallas by reflecting on the role of simple rules in informing policymaking. Three benefits of simple rules in monetary policymaking In his Carnegie Rochester conference paper, John considered a simple policy rule under which the nominal federal funds rate is adjusted in response to both the gap between real and trend gross domestic product (GDP) and the gap between the inflation rate and policymakers' target. Based on data for DATE, John calibrated the long-run target for inflation and the two parameters that determine the responsiveness of the federal funds rate to the two gaps. The equilibrium real interest rate was based on a longer history of actual real interest rates. In the handout, Figure 1A depicts the actual nominal funds rate and the Taylor rule prescriptions DATE, as presented in John's paper. Despite its simplicity, this policy rule fits the data remarkably well; it described a period of generally successful policymaking; and it adhered to the Taylor principle of adjusting the nominal rate more than one-for-one with changes in the inflation rate, so it provided a plausible template for future success. It is no wonder that John has been such a dedicated salesman and that his efforts have been so well received in academia and policy councils. Following John's seminal contribution, many other economists have engaged in research on similar policy rules and, together with John, have identified several benefits of such rules in conducting monetary policy. I will elaborate on three of them. The first benefit of looking at a simple rule like John's is that it can provide a useful benchmark for policymakers. It relates policy setting systematically to the state of the economy in a way that, over time, will produce reasonably good outcomes on average. Importantly, the emphasis is on levels and gaps, not growth rates, as inputs to the policy process. This emphasis can be a problem when a level, say of potential GDP, is in question, but in many respects it is also a virtue. For the United States, the two gaps relate directly to the legislative mandate of the Federal Reserve to achieve stable prices and maximum employment. Moreover, those two gaps fit directly into most modern macroeconomic theories, which tell us something about their relationship and how that relationship can be affected by the type of shock hitting the economy. Model uncertainties make the simplicity of the rule particularly important for the policymaker because research suggests that the prescriptions from simple rules can be more robust than optimal-control policies. Optimal-control policies can depend critically on the exact specification of the model, and clearly there is no consensus about which model best describes the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve policymakers are shown several versions of Taylor rules in the material we receive before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I always look at those charts and tables and ask myself whether I am comfortable with any significant deviation of my policy prescription from those of the rules. A second benefit of simple rules is that they help financial market participants form a baseline for expectations regarding the future course of monetary policy. Even if the actual policy process is far more sophisticated than any simple rule could completely describe, the rule often provides a reasonably good approximation of what policymakers decide and a framework for thinking about policy actions. Indeed, many financial market participants have used the Taylor rule to understand U.S. monetary policy over DATE. Investors and other market participants are going to form expectations about policy and act on those expectations. The more accurate and informed those expectations are, the more likely are their actions to reinforce the intended effects of policy. A third benefit is that simple rules can be helpful in the central bank's communication with the general public. Such an understanding is important for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Giving the public some sense of how the central bank sees the output and inflation gaps and how they are expected to evolve will help it understand the central bank's objectives and how policymakers are likely to respond to surprises in incoming data. Four limitations of simple rules Simple rules have limitations, of course, as benchmarks for monetary policy. To quote from John's Carnegie Rochester paper, \"a policy rule can be implemented and operated more informally by policymakers who recognize the general instrument responses that underlie the policy rule, but who also recognize that operating the rule requires judgment and cannot be done by computer\" (p. NUM). In that context, four limitations of simple rules are important. The first limitation is that the use of a Taylor rule requires that a single measure of inflation be used to obtain the rule prescriptions. The price index used by John in the Carnegie Rochester paper was the GDP price deflator. Other researchers have used the inflation measure based on the consumer price index (CPI). Over DATE, the Federal Reserve has emphasized the inflation rate as measured by changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). Many researchers have also explored the use of core price indexes, which exclude the volatile food and energy components, as better predictors of future inflation or as more robust indicators of the sticky prices that some theories say should be the targets of policy. To be sure, over long periods, most of these measures behave very similarly. But policy is made in the here and now, and the various indexes can diverge significantly for long stretches, potentially providing different signals for the appropriate course of monetary policy. Second, the implementation of the Taylor rule and other related rules requires determining the level of the equilibrium real interest rate and the level of potential output; neither of them are observable variables, and both must be inferred from other information. John used NUM percent as a rough guess as to the real federal funds rate that would be consistent with the economy producing at its potential. But the equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate probably varies over time because it depends on factors such as the growth rate of potential output, fiscal policy, and the willingness of savers to supply credit to households and businesses. Inaccurate estimates of this rate will mislead policymakers about the policy stance required to achieve full employment. In a similar vein, real-time estimates of potential output can be derived in a number of ways and - as shown by Orphanides (DATE) and others - they are subject to large and persistent errors. If policymakers inadvertently rely on flawed estimates, they will encounter persistent problems in achieving their inflation objective. The third limitation of using simple rules for monetary policymaking stems from the fact that, by their nature, simple rules involve only a small number of variables. However, the state of a complex economy like that of the United States cannot be fully captured by any small set of summary statistics. Moreover, policy is best made looking forward, that is, on the basis of projections of how inflation and economic activity may evolve. Lagged or current values of the small set of variables used in a given simple rule may not provide a sufficient guide to future economic developments, especially in periods of rapid or unusual change. For these reasons, central banks monitor a wide range of indicators in conducting monetary policy. In his Carnegie Rochester paper, John mentioned the stock market crash of DATE as an example of how other variables can and should influence the course of monetary policy in some situations. The final limitation I want to highlight is that simple policy rules may not capture riskmanagement considerations. In some circumstances, the risks to the outlook or the perceived costs of missing an objective on a particular side may be sufficiently skewed that policymakers will choose to respond by adjusting policy in a way that would not be justified solely by the current state of the economy or the modal outlook for output and inflation gaps. Policy rules around DATE Some of the ambiguities and potential pitfalls in the use of simple policy rules are highlighted by considering their prescriptions for DATE. Turning to Figure 1B, the solid line indicates the actual federal funds rate between the first quarter of DATE and DATE, and the dashed line shows the prescriptions of the Taylor rule using the same methodology that John used in his Jackson Hole remarks this year.NUM For the earlier part of the sample, the prescription from this simple rule tracks the actual funds rate relatively well. As John pointed out, a notable deviation happened beginning in DATE, and I would like to discuss that period to illustrate the limitations I noted earlier. Inflation measure The first limitation is related to the measure used for the inflation variable included in the rules. The rule prescriptions depicted by the dashed line in Figure 1B are based on the headline CPI. But as you know, the FOMC often looks at core inflation, stripping out the effects of energy and food prices, as a better indicator of future price behavior. The dotted line represents the rule prescriptions based on the chain-weighted core CPI, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has produced since DATE. Using this measure lowers the prescribed funds rate by about NUM percentage points during DATE, bringing the rule prescriptions much closer to the actual path of policy. The reason for the improvement is evident from Figure 2A, on the other side of the handout: Even though the headline and core CPI measures were broadly similar in the mid- to DATE, these measures diverged substantially between DATE and NUM. Potential output The second limitation relates to the challenge of judging the level of potential output in real time. To illustrate this point, Figure 2B plots three measures of the output gap. The solid line is the real-time estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that was used in the Taylor rule prescriptions in Figure 1B, while the dashed line depicts the CBO's ex post estimate of the output gap as of DATE. Back in DATE, the CBO estimated that output at that time was below potential by only NUM percent. With the benefit of DATE of data, the CBO currently estimates that the output gap for the first half of DATE was considerably wider - about NUM percent. In addition, the dotted line represents an alternative measure of resource utilization derived from the unemployment rate and an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) taken from the Board staff's FRB/US model. In fact, the unemployment rate was rising through the middle of DATE, so the FOMC had every reason to believe that the output gap was widening at that time. Using this unemploymentbased measure rather than the real-time CBO measure would reduce the prescriptions of simple policy rules by roughly NUM/NUM percentage point in early DATE. Other variables The third limitation in my list was that the small set of economic measures included in simple rules may not fully reflect the state of the economy. Around DATE, financial market conditions may not have been adequately summarized by the assumed NUM percent equilibrium federal funds rate. Accounting scandals caused economic agents to lose confidence in published financial statements and in bond ratings. The result was higher uncertainty about the financial health of firms, and credit spreads widened substantially. Figure 2C shows that risk spreads on corporate bonds were elevated in this period. Other things equal, such spreads would reduce the federal funds rate needed to achieve full employment, perhaps explaining a portion of the gap between the actual federal funds rate and the outcome from the policy rule during this period. Risk management The last item on my list of limitations was that simple rules do not take account of riskmanagement considerations. As shown in Figure 2A, the core CPI inflation rate for DATE was falling toward NUM percent. The real-time reading of the core PCE inflation rate (not shown) was on average even lower than the comparable CPI figure. Given these rates, the possibility of deflation could not be ruled out. We had carefully analyzed the Japanese experience of the DATE; our conclusion was that aggressively moving against the risk of deflation would pay dividends by reducing the odds on needing to deal with the zero bound on nominal interest rates should the economy be hit with another negative shock. This factor is not captured by simple policy rules. A final note I have offered this analysis in the spirit of so many of the discussions I have had with John. His framework has been enormously important to policymaking in the Federal Reserve, and it has yielded many benefits. Nevertheless, it's important to keep in mind that some significant practical limitations also are associated with the application of such rules in real time. In other words, it's not so simple to use simple rules! References Orphanides, Athanasios (DATE). \"The Quest for Prosperity without Inflation,\" Journal of Monetary Economics, vol.

                  "Frederic S Mishkin: Headline versus core inflation in the conduct of monetary policy Remarks by Mr Frederic S Mishkin, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Business Cycles, International Transmission and Macroeconomic Policies Conference, HEC Montreal, Montreal, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    In discussing and thinking about the conduct of monetary policy, many central bankers focus on core inflation - that is, a measure of inflation that excludes the rate of increase of prices for certain volatile components in price indexes.NUM The Federal Reserve, for example, pays particular attention to the rate of growth of the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator, which excludes food and energy prices. Indeed, in the presentation of its twice yearly Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, the Federal Reserve Board reports the projections of Federal Open Market Committee participants regarding core PCE inflation, not headline inflation, the latter of which includes all items in the price index. Here in Canada, unlike in the United States, the central bank maintains an explicit inflation target. The Bank of Canada states its target in terms of the headline consumer price index, and although this choice of inflation measure contrasts with the Federal Reserve's preferred index, the difference is not nearly as great as it appears on the surface. In fact, the Bank of Canada monitors a number of inflation measures and uses core inflation as an \"operational guide\" in coming to its monetary policy decisions and discussing these decisions with the public. Does it make sense for a central bank to concentrate on core inflation? After all, households DATE pay for energy and food items - which are excluded from the most prominent measures of core inflation - when they fill up their cars at gas stations or visit a grocery store. Households, particularly less-affluent households, spend a major portion of their budgets on food and energy. A focus on core inflation, which excludes these items, might be viewed as indicating that monetary policy makers are out of touch with what consumers really care about. Wouldn't it be better for monetary policy authorities to focus on headline inflation so that they include food and energy in their monitoring of consumer price inflation? As I will argue, this is not an either-or decision. It does indeed make sense for central banks to emphasize headline inflation when determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy over the medium run, but policymakers also are right to emphasize core inflation when deciding how to adjust policy from meeting to meeting. Why? Because what central bankers are truly concerned with - both for the purposes of internal deliberations and for communications with the public - is the underlying rate of inflation going forward, and core inflation can be a useful proxy for that rate. Thus, focusing on core inflation can help prevent a central bank from responding too strongly to transitory movements in inflation. Why monetary policy should focus on core inflation Because households care about the prices of all the items they buy, it clearly does not make sense to pretend that people do not eat or drive. Thus, I have no qualm in stating that controlling headline inflation, not core inflation, is - along with maintaining maximum sustainable employment - the ultimate aim of monetary policy. Nonetheless, I will argue that it is still useful for monetary policy makers to focus on core inflation when deciding how to respond to incoming economic news. Although monetary policy is capable of controlling overall inflation in the long run, it does not have the ability to control relative price movements such as those for food and energy. When a cold snap freezes the Florida orange crop or a tropical storm hits the gasoline refineries along the Gulf Coast, monetary policy cannot reverse the resulting spikes in prices for fresh orange juice or for gasoline at the pump. Temporary supply shocks such as these raise the prices of food and energy relative to other prices and can have substantial effects on inflation in the short run. By including all items - including particularly volatile items like food and energy - headline measures of inflation are inherently noisy and often do not reflect changes in the underlying rate of inflation, the rate at which headline inflation is likely to settle and that monetary policy can affect. Measures of core inflation attempt to strip out or smooth volatile changes in particular prices to distinguish the inflation signal from the transitory noise. Thus, relative to changes in headline inflation measures, changes in core measures are much less likely to be reversed, provide a clearer picture of the underlying inflation pressures, and so serve as a better guide to where headline inflation itself is heading. Of course, if a particular shock to noncore prices is not temporary but, rather, turns out to be more persistent, then the higher costs are likely to put some upward pressure on core prices. Central bankers must always be aware of this risk. However, research has shown that, over DATE or more, headline inflation in the United States has tended to revert more strongly toward core inflation than core inflation has moved toward headline inflation.NUM As that record suggests, core measures often are much better than headline indexes at providing a first approximation of the permanent changes to inflation. When headline inflation has an important transitory component, a focus on core measures can help avoid monetary policy mistakes. If the monetary authorities react to headline inflation numbers, they run the risk of responding to merely temporary fluctuations in inflation. We can think about this danger by considering a supply shock, that causes the relative price of energy to increase sharply, as in fact has happened over DATE. Let us suppose that we start out with both headline and core inflation at acceptably low levels. First, let's consider a supply shock that temporarily raises the price of energy by a large amount. In this case headline inflation will rise well above its underlying trend as the price of energy rises but will soon fall well below its underlying trend as the price of energy falls back to its initial level. On average, inflation will remain unchanged without any monetary policy NUM These tests allow for a nonzero constant differential between headline and core inflation. The differential often turns out to be nontrivial and statistically significant. Cogley (DATE) uses published CPI over the period from DATE:Q2 to DATE:Q4 and finds that it may take DATE before there is substantial reversion of headline inflation to core inflation. Clark (DATE), using DATE CPI inflation from DATE to DATE finds little reversion over DATE but about NUM percent reversion over DATE, though that level is still statistically insignificant. In contrast, he finds substantial and statistically significant reversion at both the NUM- and DATE horizons using data from DATE to DATE. Rich and Steindel (DATE) find significant reversion of headline CPI inflation to core CPI inflation over DATE using methodologically consistent CPI data from DATE. An earlier version of their work (Rich and Steindel, DATE) showed similar results using PCE price inflation in DATE and DATE periods. Internal work conducted at the Federal Reserve using DATE rolling-window regressions suggests that the reversion of headline PCE inflation to core PCE inflation has been much stronger in samples that start after DATE and also that the reversion of core inflation to headline inflation has been much weaker in that period. Results for other countries are more ambiguous. In DATE, Canada appears to have had a similar reversion of headline inflation to their version of core inflation, along with little reversion of core inflation to headline inflation (Laflèche and Armour, DATE; also, Armour, DATE; Hogan, Johnson, and Laflèche, DATE). However, the OECD (DATE) has found that many countries show little reversion of headline inflation to core inflation and that, in fact, core inflation often reverts to headline inflation. BIS Review NUM/DATE action. But a tightening of monetary policy in reaction to the rise in headline inflation would lead to a decline in employment and inflation; and because of the long lags between monetary policy actions and changes in economic activity, that decline would occur some time down the road, when inflation would more likely be at or below its underlying trend. The outcome of such a policy would be a more pronounced fall in inflation with a decline in employment. Such a policy would be bad indeed because it would increase volatility in inflation and employment, which is the opposite of what a central bank should be trying to achieve as it seeks to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment. But what if a supply shock leads to a permanent shift in the relative price of energy? Indeed, almost all commentators characterize the current oil price shock that way, in part because they see the rise of new economic powers like China as adding to the demand for energy in the foreseeable future. Although in that case the rise in relative energy prices is not reversed, the rate of change in energy prices does not persist: Headline inflation will rise with the increase in energy prices, but once energy prices reach their permanently high level, headline inflation will revert to its underlying trend rate. Thus, as long as the permanent change in relative energy prices does not lead to a change in the underlying trend rate of inflation - a crucial assumption - then headline inflation will come back down again. This is what we seem to have seen recently in the United States. From a low near $NUM per barrel in DATE, the price of oil rose to $NUM per barrel by the middle of DATE, and it has stayed high, with the current price more than $NUM. That move increased headline PCE inflation to the NUM percent level for a time, but it has since retreated to around NUM percent (figure NUM). Monetary policy clearly can do little about the first-round effects of a permanent rise in energy prices, which include both its direct impact on the energy component of overall consumer prices and the pass-through of higher energy costs into prices of non-energy goods and services. But policy does have a critical role to play in determining the secondround effects associated with changes in the underlying trend rate of inflation. Such secondround effects are likely to be quite limited as long as the rise in the relative price of energy does not lead to a rise in long-run inflation expectations, as has largely been the case in the recent period (figure NUM). However, the stability of expectations rests on the central bank's strong long-term commitment to providing a nominal anchor, which, as I have argued elsewhere (Mishkin, DATE), describes the situation in the United States. With such a commitment firmly established, monetary policy then does not need to respond as much to the temporary rise in headline inflation to stabilize inflation over the longer run. Under these circumstances, if monetary policy is tightened appreciably in the face of a surge in headline inflation, the policy would likely be excessively tight and lead to an unnecessary decline in employment. Because the point about headline inflation is so important, I would like to illustrate it further with simulations of FRB/US, the model of the U.S. economy created and maintained by the staff at the Federal Reserve Board. To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels. The economy is then assumed to experience a shock that raises the world price of oil about $NUM per barrel over DATE; the shock is assumed to slowly dissipate thereafter. In each of two scenarios, a Taylor rule is assumed to govern the response of the federal funds rate; the only difference between the two is that in one scenario the funds rate responds to core PCE inflation, while in the other it responds to headline PCE inflation.NUM Figure NUM illustrates the results of these two scenarios. The federal funds rate jumps higher and faster when the central bank responds to headline inflation rather than to core inflation, as would be expected (top-left panel). Likewise, responding to headline inflation pushes the unemployment rate markedly higher than otherwise in the early going (top-right panel), and produces an inflation rate that is slightly lower than otherwise, whether measured by core or headline indexes (bottom panels). More important, even for a shock as persistent as this one, the policy response under headline inflation has to be unwound in the sense that the federal funds rate must drop substantially below baseline once the first-round effects of the shock drop out of the inflation data. Responding to headline inflation is therefore inappropriate because it generates extensive variability in the unemployment rate - variability that is much more subdued when policy responds to core inflation.NUM Of course, the pitfalls associated with reacting to realized headline inflation, as illustrated by this simulation, are well understood. Accordingly, advocates of targeting headline inflation generally have in mind a strategy of responding to forecasts of headline inflation - forecasts that try to take account of inflation movements that are likely to be transitory. This is a further illustration of my basic point, namely, that it is important to distinguish between transitory and persistent inflation movements, and focusing on core inflation can help achieve that end.NUM The focus on core instead of headline inflation - and clear communication with the public about that focus - can have another benefit: It may help anchor inflation expectations when headline inflation increases temporarily but core inflation remains essentially unchanged. If the public understands that the central bank is using core inflation in formulating monetary policy and trusts that the central bank is right to do so, the public will realize that the central bank does not need to respond aggressively to a surge in headline inflation to keep inflation under control. And, with core inflation stable, the public will be less likely to think that the central bank has weakened its commitment to a strong nominal anchor when it does not tighten monetary policy to stabilize headline inflation. The result is that inflation expectations are likely to remain anchored, which may lead to better outcomes not only on inflation but on employment as well, because the central bank will not have had to tighten monetary policy as much in response to the energy price shock. As I noted earlier, figure NUM offers some support for this view: It shows that the rise in headline inflation in the DATE period, when core inflation remained quite stable, did not lead to an appreciable rise in long-run inflation expectations, even with a substantial decline in unemployment during this period. Is inflation excluding food and energy the best measure of underlying inflation? The most popular core inflation measures used and published in the United States are quite straightforward: They simply exclude changes in food and energy prices. However, such simple \"exclusion\" measures can likely be improved upon. For example, many of the food categories excluded in the standard measure of core inflation, such as food away from home (restaurants), are not highly volatile and so likely should remain in an optimal core inflation measure. On the other hand, some items that are not excluded from the U.S. core measures, such as airline fares, tobacco, and apparel, are extremely volatile and thus are unlikely to be included in an optimal core inflation measure. The Bank of Canada, for example, uses a more targeted approach to its core inflation indicator, the CPIX. Of fifty-four consumer product categories, it excludes eight, which account for about NUM percent of the consumption basket (Macklem, DATE). Most of the eight items are also excluded from the standard core measure in the United States. However, Canada's CPIX also excludes intercity transportation and tobacco, which are included in the U.S. core measures.NUM Another approach to estimating core inflation measures is statistical, in which certain prices are excluded at each point on the basis of statistical criteria. Among these statistical measures are trimmed indexes, such as the trimmed mean and the weighted median consumer price indexes produced by the Cleveland Fed and the trimmed mean PCE price index produced by the Dallas Fed. DATE, these measures throw out the components with the largest price changes, both positive and negative (though the Dallas measure is asymmetric).NUM Other approaches to estimating core inflation are theory-based measures employing common trends, unobserved components, or a particular model of the economy.NUM However, these theory-based approaches tend to be rather complex and require faith that the model they are based on is the right one. Each of these measures of core inflation can be evaluated according to a variety of criteria, including the ability to forecast headline inflation over some period and the degree of correlation with alternative definitions of trend inflation. According to some of these criteria, statistical and theory-based approaches are sometimes found to outperform simpler exclusion measures of core inflation, like the standard one excluding food and energy. As you can tell, this is an active area of research, but recent research done at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on U.S. data finds that no one particular core measure, including the standard one, dominates the others: The relative performance of different core measures varies depending on the choice of the price index, the sample period, and the criteria for evaluating their performance (Rich and Steindel, DATE). Research on Canadian and U.K. data comes to similar conclusions (Hogan, Johnson, and Laflèche, DATE; Mankikar and Paisley, DATE). Does the lack of empirical support for any one particular type of core measure suggest that our focus on the standard core measure should be abandoned? I think not. The simplicity and long history of the standard core measure that excludes food and energy gives it several major advantages. Its simplicity makes it straightforward to explain and thus more understandable to the public - assuming, of course, that we successfully communicate that we recognize the importance of food and energy items in people's consumption. Its simplicity also makes its estimation very transparent. That transparency and the fact that it has been around a long time - hence the characterization as \"standard\" - both prevent a central bank or a government authority from easily manipulating the measure to show good results. These features of the standard core measure therefore make it a credible device to keep inflation expectations anchored when supply shocks occur: If the standard measure remains stable, then a surge in headline inflation is less likely to unhinge inflation expectations, which as we have seen can lead to both better inflation and better employment performance. Why central banks should also focus on headline inflation Despite the advantages of core measures of inflation, their use in conducting monetary policy has been criticized.NUM Core measures of inflation attempt to remove the most volatile or transitory components of the inflation measure. But, because the nature of price shocks may change over time, items that have been highly volatile in the past may not be so in the future; hence, any core measure will itself likely be subject to transitory shocks. Unfortunately, as noted above, empirical research suggests that no one measure of core inflation will work in all situations. Therefore, central banks do not focus solely on core inflation; rather, they devote considerable resources to understanding inflation developments in an effort to distinguish signal from noise in the incoming data.NUM Another reason to keep watch over the broader inflation picture is that, if the rate of change in the price of an excluded item receives a permanent shock, then the headline inflation rate can deviate from the core measure for an extended period of time. The longer this period of high headline inflation persists, the greater is the risk of second-round effects as the public begins to build this higher inflation into its expectations. For example, from DATE to DATE, energy price shocks appear to have been temporary in that energy prices were mean reverting; as a result, in this period, the average difference between core and headline PCE inflation was quite small. Since DATE, however, the effect of energy price shocks have been more persistent, and headline inflation has averaged more than NUM/NUM percentage point above core inflation over this period. Over DATE, energy prices have about leveled off on balance - or at least that was the case until DATE - and the rate of headline inflation for most of DATE has come down close to that for core, one hopes alleviating the risk of second-round effects. But the increases in oil prices in DATE provide another reminder that shocks can persist longer than one might have at first expected. A prolonged divergence between core and headline measures of inflation could complicate central bank communications with the public because core inflation would require some adjustment before it would provide a clear gauge of underlying inflation. For example, the weighted median CPI inflation rate, one popular measure of core inflation, has tended to be a biased measure of headline inflation. The weighted median is exactly equal to owners' equivalent rent nearly half the time because that component has an extremely large share of the consumption basket and fairly low volatility (Bryan and Pike, DATE; Hogan and others, DATE; and Bryan and Meyer, DATE). However, the productivity growth rate in residential construction is not terribly high, and so this sector is likely to have below-average productivity growth and above-average price increases. Indeed, the weighted median CPI exceeded overall CPI inflation on average by NUM/NUM percentage point per year over DATE DATE, a period when energy prices were transitory. Of course, to the extent that such a bias in a core inflation measure is stable or predictable, the central bank could easily take this into account in setting monetary policy. But even in that case, differences in average rates of inflation between the core measure and overall inflation could complicate communication with the public. Conclusion I have argued that a measure of core inflation that is easily understood and provides some greater signal about persistent movements in inflation than does headline inflation itself is extremely valuable for the conduct of monetary policy, and that is why the Federal Reserve pays so much attention to such measures. However, I have also argued that core measures have their limitations. A single core inflation measure cannot account for all types of shocks and can at times be misleading about what is happening to the underlying rate of overall inflation. And if increases in headline inflation prove more persistent than initially expected, central bankers must be vigilant to ensure that they do not become embedded into expectations and thereby generate substantial second-round effects on inflation. Finally, because price stability ultimately involves control of overall, headline inflation, which after all is the inflation measure that households really care about, central bankers should and do pay attention to headline inflation as well as to core inflation measures. A core inflation measure should not be seen as a substitute for thorough and careful analysis of the forces that are driving our economy and the inflation process.

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Economic outlook and developments in mortgage markets Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Eller College of Management Distinguished Speaker Series, Tucson, Arizona, DATE.    To begin, I would like to thank Dean Portney and everyone at the Eller College of Management here at The University of Arizona for the invitation to speak TIME. I know that this audience includes both experienced business leaders as well as students preparing to apply the knowledge they have learned in the classroom to the real world. Accordingly, my remarks will first touch on the economic outlook. Then, I will offer some thoughts on the challenges facing consumers as they navigate DATE's changing mortgage loan market. Economic outlook Economic activity slowed in the middle part of DATE. After rising at an DATE rate of NUM-NUM/NUM percent over DATE, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an DATE rate of NUM percent in the second quarter of DATE. Real GDP growth in the second half of DATE slowed after accounting for some measurement difficulties in the automotive sector. Despite the recent slowing in output, however, resource utilization remains relatively high by historical standards and thus continues to be a potential source of upward pressure on inflation. In the aftermath of the DATE recession, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased monetary policy substantially. However, the degree of easing in place in DATE and DATE was clearly unsustainable. Since mid-DATE, the FOMC has gradually moved monetary policy from an accommodative stance to a more neutral position. As a consequence, the elements now appear to be in place for some easing of resource utilization rates over DATE and a reduction in inflationary pressures. However, substantial uncertainty surrounds the near-term outlook. In determining the future path of interest rates, the FOMC will be guided by the incoming data on both output and prices, so let's begin by reviewing recent developments. Economic activity The slowdown in the growth of real GDP since DATE largely reflects a cooling of the housing market: Sales of both new and existing homes dropped sharply after their peak in DATE, the inventory of unsold homes has soared, and the number of single-family and multifamily housing starts has fallen nearly NUM percent since the beginning of DATE. At the same time, homes are appreciating more slowly and in some markets prices are even declining. Nonetheless, a variety of factors should help limit any remaining contraction in housing demand. For example, despite the NUM-NUM/NUM percentage point increase in short-term interest rates over DATE, the interest rate on a DATE fixed-rate mortgage has increased only about NUM/NUM percentage point, and borrowing costs continue to be relatively low. The ongoing growth in employment and real incomes and the recent increase in the stock market wealth of households should also support the demand for housing. Indeed, the latest data on home sales and consumer homebuying attitudes suggest that the demand for housing may be stabilizing. While much of the downshift in the housing market appears to have occurred already, some further softening in housing starts may yet lie ahead as the inventory of unsold homes is reduced to appropriate levels. That said, it is encouraging that the recent weakness in residential construction does not appear to have spilled over to other sectors. For instance, employment has been growing nicely in nonresidential construction, even as it has shrunk in the residential sector. In addition, consumer confidence currently stands a good bit above its long-run average and consumption is still being fueled by past house-price gains, which raised household wealth. This contrasts with previous slowdowns in the housing market, which have typically coincided with widespread economic weakness. Although the slowdown in the housing market has so far done little to reduce consumer outlays, other factors do appear to have had a damping effect. In particular, consumption likely was restrained DATE by the rise in energy prices, which took a large bite out of household budgets. The rise in energy prices over DATE has also affected the auto sector, most notably by reducing the demand for gas-guzzling automobiles, such as sport-utility vehicles and trucks. As a result of this decreased demand and other factors, inventories of these types of vehicles rose in the second half of DATE. In response, domestic automakers cut production. However, the latest data on auto sales and scheduled new-vehicle production suggest that the drag from the inventory correction in this sector may be easing. Offsetting influences on consumption should support continued growth of consumer spending. The slowing in the appreciation of house prices will likely reduce the impetus to consumer spending from this source, while recent increases in stock market values, declines in energy prices and strong employment and wage growth should spur consumption. In the business sector, spending on nonresidential construction has been particularly robust. Expenditures on drilling and mining structures have increased rapidly in response to high prices for natural gas and crude oil. Investment in other types of structures, such as offices and commercial buildings, has also been strong. Data for DATE and DATE indicate that although the growth rate of nonresidential investment moderated substantially in the fourth quarter of DATE, it still remained healthy by historical standards. Spending on equipment and software grew quite rapidly from mid-DATE to mid-NUM, but appears to have advanced at a substantially slower pace in the second half of DATE. The recent stepdown in the growth of business sales likely had a damping influence on capital spending, and, in fact, business sentiment has moved down in DATE. However, some backlog of unfilled orders for capital goods such as industrial machinery and other types of heavy equipment remains, which should help support spending in the near term. Moreover, the demand for information technology equipment is likely to be well maintained, in part because of the recent introduction of a new generation of microprocessing chips and more-efficient large servers. Current financial conditions are also supportive of business spending. Corporate balance sheets are strong and flush with cash, profits are strong, and broad stock price indexes are up appreciably since the beginning of DATE. At the same time, yield spreads on corporate bonds across the ratings spectrum have been low, supported by the strong balance sheets and robust profits. Inflation What are the implications of current economic activity on inflation prospects? Consumer prices excluding food and energy accelerated through DATE - the core inflation rate was NUM percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of DATE, up from NUM percent for DATE before.NUM The more recent DATE readings have been more favorable - core prices rose NUM percent over the twelve months through last DATE, only a touch higher than the NUM percent rise over DATE, and this TIME's latest figures on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) suggest that this pattern continued into DATE. Nevertheless, the risk to inflation continues to be on the upside until we see further confirmation in this trend toward moderation. In thinking about the macroeconomic consequences of inflation, it makes sense to look at the core rate, which excludes the prices of energy and food, when the focus is on the short run. This is because temporary shocks to food and energy prices typically don't translate into changes in inflationary pressure. However, if these shocks persist, they may have an effect on core inflation and, more generally, on the economic behavior of households and businesses. Core inflation can be affected when the price changes are propagated along the production chain - say from oil prices to the prices of chemicals and ultimately to the prices of goods made with those chemicals. In addition, shocks to food and energy prices may affect inflation expectations. Thus, we also pay attention to broader measures of inflation. All things considered, the scene appears to be set for a deceleration in prices. One contributing factor is likely to be the slowing in economic activity I already discussed, which should ease the overall pressure on resources. Another important factor affecting the inflation outlook is household and business expectations for inflation. As best we can judge, inflation expectations appear to be well contained: Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, based on surveys and on a comparison of yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt, have remained within the ranges in which they have fluctuated in DATE. Finally, the recent decline in energy prices, if sustained, should reduce cost pressures along the production chain. But a decline in the inflation rate is not assured. Outside of the housing and automotive sectors, growth remains sound and labor markets remain tight, especially for skilled workers. The unemployment rate began to decline in the second half of DATE and by the fourth quarter of DATE stood at a relatively low NUM-NUM/NUM percent. With labor markets comparatively tight by historical standards, unit labor costs have accelerated over DATE, and firms may pass on some of these higher costs to consumers. However, strong business profit margins, which are currently well above their historical averages, could act as a shock absorber if cost strains were to intensify. All told, in my judgment, inflation appears poised to decelerate in DATE as energy prices stabilize and resource pressures ease. But the risks to that outlook seem tilted toward the upside. The Federal Reserve and consumer protection My remarks on the economic outlook discussed developments in housing markets, but now I would like to delve into a specific area of mortgage lending: consumer awareness and understanding of changes in mortgage markets. Given its role as the central bank, a banking supervisor, and a consumer protection regulator for financial services, the Federal Reserve takes a multifaceted approach to understanding the consumer financial services market. Thus, we recognize the importance of homeownership in building household wealth and we monitor the safety and soundness of mortgage underwriting practices. We also write regulations that help ensure consumers understand the characteristics of financial services and products and that they receive the protections available for these services and products. Since DATE, Congress has enacted several laws to ensure that consumers receive comprehensive information and fair treatment in a broad range of financial transactions. These laws protect consumers in transactions involving credit and debit card accounts; automated teller machine transactions and other electronic fund transfers; deposit account activities; automobile leases; mortgages and home equity loans; and lines of credit and other unsecured credit. Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve a considerable role in ensuring that consumers are protected under these laws. For example, the Federal Reserve writes rules to implement the Truth in Lending Act, which Congress enacted to ensure that consumers receive clear information about credit terms and costs. The Federal Reserve is also responsible for rules that implement fair lending laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in credit transactions. In addition, we work with other federal agencies to write joint rules, for example, to ensure that consumers' financial privacy is protected. The Federal Reserve also examines state member banks and foreign banking organizations and exercises its umbrella supervisory authority with respect to bank and financial holding companies to address compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve is committed to vigorous enforcement of those laws. Further, the Federal Reserve develops consumer education materials, recognizing that well-educated consumers are better able to protect themselves in financial transactions. Clearly, to choose wisely from the variety of products and providers available, consumers must have the financial knowledge to navigate DATE's increasingly complex financial services marketplace. For example, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision just revised the Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages (CHARM) to include additional information about nontraditional mortgage products. The CHARM booklet is an important means for delivering information about alternative adjustable rate mortgage products to consumers because creditors are required to provide a copy of the booklet to each consumer who receives an application for an ARM. Because the booklet is provided at this early stage in the process, it can be useful in encouraging consumers to ask brokers and lenders the right questions to decide if this type of loan is right for them. The booklet explains such features as payment shock and negative amortization. It also provides numerical examples that illustrate how consumers' payments can change and how their loan balances may increase over the term of the loan. The Federal Reserve also published a consumer education brochure titled: Interest-Only Mortgage Payments and Option-Payment ARMs --Are They for You? The brochure is designed to assist consumers who are shopping for a mortgage loan and is available in printed form and in electronic form on the Federal Reserve's website, along with other consumer mortgage information Finally, the Federal Reserve engages in numerous outreach activities and conducts research to help us better understand the financial services market and consumer behavior and the best approaches for assisting consumers. We sponsor consumer and industry surveys, hold public hearings, discuss issues with our Consumer Advisory Council, and conduct consumer focus groups and other types of consumer testing, in addition to considering the public comments on proposed rules. Recently, the Federal Reserve has engaged in outreach to a broad group of interested parties regarding nontraditional mortgages. Our Consumer Advisory Council, which includes consumer advocates and industry representatives, provided us with valuable information about nontraditional mortgage products during development of the interagency guidance. In addition, the Federal Reserve held a series of four public hearings on home-equity lending during DATE. One of the principal purposes of the hearings was to gather information to inform the Federal Reserve's review of its Truth in Lending rules. A significant portion of the hearings was devoted to discussing nontraditional mortgage products, and in particular, whether consumers receive adequate information about these products. The hearings explored research on consumer behavior in shopping for mortgage loans and included discussions about the challenges in designing disclosures to more effectively communicate loan terms and risks to consumers. We will consider this information in developing plans and recommendations for revising the Truth in Lending rules, which require all creditors to provide consumers with disclosures about loan terms. Many financial products are very sophisticated credit transactions, and the disclosures describing them are also complex and highly technical; which can be difficult for some consumers to understand. To address this issue, the Federal Reserve is focusing in a more rigorous way on determining the effectiveness of disclosures. We conduct extensive consumer testing to determine what information is most important to consumers, when it is most useful for consumers to receive it, what language and formats work best, and how disclosures can be simplified, and better organized, to reduce complexity and information overload. To that end, the Federal Reserve uses design consultants to assist in developing model disclosures that are most likely to be effective in communicating vital credit information to consumers. The Federal Reserve also uses consumer testing to assist in developing model disclosure forms, and we draw from research done by respected behavioral economists. For example, when considering some regulatory changes related to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Federal Reserve used consumer focus group testing to develop useful and timely disclosures for employees whose pay is received in the form of a payroll card (a card that works much like a traditional debit card). The Federal Reserve is also engaging in extensive consumer testing of credit card disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act, and has found those interactions with consumers instructive in revising disclosures to be more meaningful to consumers in DATE's complex and highly prolific credit card market. Mortgage lending I now want to discuss developments in mortgage loan products. DATE, the federal financial institution regulators issued supervisory guidance on nontraditional mortgages. These mortgages include interest-only loans that allow consumers to defer the payment of principal and make only interest payments for an initial period. They also include adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with a payment option, allowing consumers to make \"minimum payments\" of less than the accrued interest. The result of such a loan structure is that the amount owed can increase even as the borrower makes payments, a circumstance known as negative amortization. Over time, the payments for these loans must be adjusted upward to catch up with fully indexed interest rates and/or paydowns (amortization) of the balance owed, often significantly, which sometimes results in what some call \"payment shock.\" Sometimes borrowers can refinance out of these loans, but that may cost them a serious prepayment penalty and reduce the amount of equity that they have built up in their home. The complexity of these products contrasts with traditional DATE fixed-rate loans, in which consumers have equal DATE payments that are sufficient to cover the accrued interest and pay down the principal, and with which borrowers are generally familiar. To be clear, nontraditional mortgages certainly serve a useful purpose when used appropriately. These products have increased the range of financing options available to consumers and have grown in popularity over DATE. Some consumers may benefit from these products' more flexible payment options. For example, consumers with seasonal or irregular income or who expect their incomes to increase are more likely to be able to absorb the increase in payments in the near term of the loan. But nontraditional mortgage loan products can be complex and may not be appropriate for everyone. Concerns have been raised that consumers are not getting clear and balanced information about the risks and features of interest-only and payment option ARMs. These products have been advertised and promoted based on their initially low DATE payments when compared with traditional mortgage products. By focusing on initial DATE payments without appropriate understanding of how the payments can vary over time or that minimum payments may actually increase the amount owed, many consumers have become financially overextended. Mortgage lenders are no longer limited in the size of their mortgage lending activities by the amount of available funding on their balance sheets. Mortgages are now routinely sold to institutions who securitize mortgages by aggregating them with other loans into pools. These mortgage-backed securities are held by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and other investors both in the United States and internationally. This diversity of funding sources makes it possible for lenders to structure products that meet the various needs of borrowers, and still be able to mitigate the risks they may take on if the loan were held on their balance sheets. As a result, the mortgage lending industry continually adapts to consumer requirements and investor preferences for loan securitization structures. A mortgage is generally the largest financial obligation a consumer enters into. The initial costs, the cost over the life of the mortgage, and the costs to prepay and refinance can be significant. Having a wide variety of mortgage types assists consumers in finding a way to finance the purchase of a home that best meets their own financial and lifestyle requirements. But the growing complexity of products makes it a bigger challenge for borrowers to understand the characteristics of competing products. This is where shopping among a couple of lenders and a couple of different products can help the consumer understand the features of different loan types. When looking at different loan products, consumers should consider how long they plan to own their home, expectations of future income, their stage of life cycle, and broader financial obligations in choosing among mortgage alternatives. For example, if consumers want to pay off their mortgages before retirement, they must determine if the DATE payment will fully amortize the loan by the target date. If homeowners plan to move in DATE, then they should compare prepayment penalties, if any, and interest rates among their mortgage alternatives. But some consumers do not actively shop for a lender or a mortgage, and they do not compare loan terms in light of their personal circumstances. Instead they rely on one lender and accept the mortgage loan presented to them. Mortgages that are appropriate for one borrower, however, may create problems for another. For example, some mortgages have low initial interest rates and DATE payments. But increases come later as the \"teaser period\" ends and payments rise to begin pay down of principal. Borrowers whose budgets make the initial payment just manageable may have difficulty meeting these significant jumps in DATE payments and so are at risk of defaulting on their mortgages and losing their home. By shopping among lenders and products, consumers are also better able to determine whether a given loan feature is really an advantage. For example, some lenders have recently been more willing to waive proof of income when making a mortgage. But, they may charge a higher interest rate to cover the risk that the borrower may not be able to afford the mortgage. The customer however may save interest cost by making the effort to provide copies of tax returns and pay stubs. Another example is that some lenders do not require their borrowers to pay their property tax and hazard insurance premiums into an escrow account. Consumers need to ask lenders if their DATE payments will include funds for such an escrow account. If not, borrowers need to separately set aside savings to meet these obligations. Lenders, for their part, should make it possible for consumers to engage in shopping for a mortgage. As I noted, DATE the federal financial institution regulators issued interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage products, which included both a focus on safe and sound lending practices as well as on consumer awareness and consumer protection. The guidance focuses on the responsibility of lenders to provide consumers with clear and balanced information at crucial decision-making points about the benefits and risks of nontraditional mortgage products. Accordingly, the interagency guidance describes recommended practices for financial institutions in communicating with consumers while they are shopping, not just upon submission of an application or at loan consummation. Specifically, the guidance recommends that institutions' promotional materials and descriptions of these products include information about, among other things, potential increases in consumers' payment obligations and the potential consequences of increasing principal loan balances and decreasing home equity. The guidance also recommends that institutions alert consumers to the amount of any prepayment penalty that may be imposed if the consumer refinances the mortgage. Conclusion I hope that my remarks DATE provided a useful snapshot of the current economic outlook. Outside of housing and the automotive sector, the economy is strong and employment is growing. The surge in housing construction that occurred in DATE-NUM was not sustainable, and we are now well along in adjusting housing construction to more comfortable levels. Inflation continues to run at a pace above my comfort level. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to moderate inflation. Monetary policy works with long lags and so the economy is still reacting to our past actions. Given the strong growth in most sectors of the economy, the risks to inflation are still on the upside. In addition to giving some thoughts on the economy, I felt it was useful to offer a summary of the role that the Federal Reserve plays in consumer protection, using the current example of nontraditional mortgages. Clearly, the Federal Reserve believes in promoting consumer awareness and maintaining consumer protection so that users of financial products fully understand those products and their associated risks.",

                  "Donald L Kohn: Economic outlook Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Bankers and Business Leaders Luncheon, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Oklahoma City Branch, Oklahoma, DATE.    I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the business leaders of Oklahoma City. The Federal Reserve has deep roots in this community: The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has had a Branch here since DATE. Consistent with the experience of most other enterprises DATE, the Federal Reserve is having to change the way we do business in response to rapid changes in technology. We can see the effects of these changes on the payment system DATE and all around us as we make and receive payments that depend less and less on the use of checks. To hold down costs, we have been required to reduce the number of our offices delivering payments services to banks, including check and cash operations at Oklahoma City. But closing those operations by no means implies that we are reducing our commitment to the community. Indeed, Tom Hoenig and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City are taking steps to strengthen our roots here. Our most important ties to local communities have never been primarily through the services we deliver to their banks. Rather they are established through the exchange of information between those communities and the Federal Reserve, and the Oklahoma City Branch will remain our eyes and ears in this region. Tom will continue to bring to our policy deliberations the information he gathers from Tyree Minner and his colleagues on the board of directors of the Oklahoma City Branch, from Bob Funk and his colleagues on the head office board, and from many other contacts in the region. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Oklahoma City Branch are increasing their efforts to reach out to this community to make sure that we are listening as effectively as possible to your impressions of the current economic circumstances, to explain our policies, to help educate the public in the use of the increasingly complex financial instruments available to them, and to work with community leaders to identify strategies that will help sustain a vibrant economy. The Board of Governors in Washington strongly supports these efforts by Kansas City and other Reserve Banks to deepen their ties to their communities, and I am pleased to be here as tangible evidence of that support. I thought I would take advantage of this opportunity to discuss the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy. We are at an especially interesting juncture, so this is a good time to take stock of where we are and to peer ahead through the prognosticator's always murky lens. I must emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.NUM On balance, the economy has been performing quite well in DATE, with growth strong and underlying inflation stable despite the considerable rise in energy prices over DATE. I say \"on balance\" because a number of unusual factors have been influencing the pattern of economic activity lately, adding to the normal difficulty of discerning underlying trends from inherently volatile data and other information. These factors include not only DATE devastating hurricanes but also the unusually warm weather in the early part of DATE, which very likely provided a fillip to housing construction and consumer spending. Smoothing through these events, however, the economy has been expanding at a pretty good clip by historical standards--probably an DATE rate of about NUM-NUM/NUM percent since DATE. Several factors have propelled reasonably strong economic growth. A critical element has been supportive financial conditions. Despite the tightening of monetary policy that began in DATE, short-term interest rates were at fairly low levels until recently, and the effects of those low rates have continued to spur household and business spending. In addition, although longer-term yields have moved up notably in DATE, they too have been low by historical standards. Moreover, credit to businesses and households has remained readily available at narrow spreads in markets and on favorable terms and conditions at banks, reflecting, in part, robust earnings and strong balance sheets at businesses along with good performance on outstanding household and business loans. The pace of economic growth in the United States has also been supported by a firming of activity abroad and the associated increases in demand for our exports. Among industrial countries, expansion of output has become more firmly established in both Japan and the euro area, while growth continues at a solid pace in the United Kingdom and Canada. Furthermore, economic growth in most of the emerging economies of Asia has been robust. U.S. exports were disrupted by DATE hurricanes in the Gulf, but smoothing through this volatility, exports appear to have been contributing substantially to the growth of gross domestic product (GDP). Our economy has been able to register this good performance despite rising energy prices. This audience knows well that since DATE the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, for delivery at Cushing, has soared from about $NUM per barrel to nearly $NUM recently. Nonetheless, the rise in energy prices has apparently had only a limited negative effect on the national economy. Energy costs are not nearly as important DATE as they once were. Since DATE, the energy intensity of production in the United States has fallen dramatically; indeed, on an inflation-adjusted basis, it takes roughly half as many Btu of energy to produce a dollar of GDP DATE than it did at the time of the DATE oil crisis. This sharply reduced share of energy costs in total business expenses has likely limited the influence of these costs on profits, on overall consumer prices and real income, and on the economy more generally. A rough estimate puts the reduction in real GDP growth from the increases in energy prices since DATE at between NUM/NUM percent and NUM percent per year. Of course, reactions to higher energy prices are hard to predict, but the measured response of activity over DATE suggests that the most recent price increases will have, at most, only a small effect on economic growth during DATE. The good performance of the economy has led to a further narrowing in the margin of unutilized resources. For example, the Federal Reserve's measure of capacity utilization in manufacturing has moved up NUM percentage points during DATE, to around NUM-NUM/NUM percent, a touch above its longer-run average. Similarly, the unemployment rate has fallen almost NUM/NUM percentage point from DATE to around NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE. Nevertheless, the underlying rate of inflation has remained moderate. Headline inflation, of course, has been boosted by the jump in energy prices. However, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on prices for non-energy goods and services. The inflation rate for prices of consumer goods and services excluding food and energy, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been running a bit under NUM percent, only about NUM/NUM percentage point above its rate DATE before the spurt in energy prices began. Inflation has been restrained, in part, by the margin of slack in labor and product markets that has persisted through much of this period. Another reason for this favorable outcome is that longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. For example, the median expected inflation rate during DATE, as reported in the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, has barely edged up in DATE, even as short-term inflation has been boosted by rising energy prices. Meanwhile, inflation compensation for investors implied by the spreads between the rates on nominal and CPI-indexed Treasury notes at both five- and DATE maturities also has not shown any tendency to move higher on balance. In DATE, declining prices of imports and the threat of import competition have also probably held down costs and prices to a degree. Moreover, increases in compensation costs have generally been modest. To be sure, average TIME earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers have been accelerating in DATE. However, the broadest measures of compensation have not picked up, suggesting that competition in labor markets has been intense. Nonetheless, with labor markets tightening, some pickup in compensation increases for the broad measures would not be surprising. Nor would a pickup necessarily be inflationary, given the very good growth in labor productivity that we have experienced in DATE. Despite the relatively moderate increases in prices and costs that we have observed lately, the capacity utilization rate and the unemployment rate have recently reached zones that on occasion in the past have been associated with the beginnings of upward pressure on inflation. Of course, the past is not always a good guide to the future, in part because a great deal of uncertainty surrounds the relationship of resource utilization and inflation. For instance, we cannot directly observe full capacity of either labor or production resources; consequently, we can never be certain what level of activity represents the full utilization of capacity. In addition, measurement issues aside, the empirical evidence of DATE suggests that the relationship between utilization and inflation can shift over time. Unfortunately, we typically are only imperfectly aware of the changes and their magnitudes in real time. In DATE, that relationship was affected by, among other things, changing trends in the growth rate of productivity and innovations in the structure of labor markets, such as increased use of temporary help supply. These uncertainties mean that we, as policymakers, need to keep not only an open mind about estimates of the economy's potential but also a close eye on the various indicators of costs and prices so that we can recognize incipient price developments and react to them as early as possible. But we also must recognize that, by the time evidence of accelerating prices becomes definitive, containing inflation pressures could entail disruptive economic adjustments. So despite the uncertainties, we must evaluate all the evidence and make our best judgments about the oncoming risks to sustained good economic performance. In the current circumstances, as the Federal Open Market Committee has said, the economic climate appears to be one in which further increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The available evidence suggests that the pace of economic expansion may moderate a little from its average over DATE, keeping resource utilization in line with recent levels. Maintaining economic growth around this pace will likely reflect a balancing of opposing forces. The rise in interest rates we have experienced will tend to restrain demand, offsetting the effects of sustained economic expansion in our trading partners and the reduced drag on U.S. growth from oil prices, assuming that those prices roughly flatten out as participants in futures markets seem to expect. If the past is any guide, the effect of rising interest rates is likely to be felt most visibly in housing markets. The rate for a DATE, fixed-rate mortgage is up NUM basis points from its level in DATE, and DATE adjustable-rate mortgages have risen more than NUM basis points over DATE. In addition, house prices have increased considerably relative to rents, incomes, and returns on alternative assets. Already there have been signs that housing demand has begun to moderate. Sales of both new and existing homes are down substantially from their levels DATE, and information on mortgage applications and pending home sales point to further softening in DATE. With demand slowing, house prices also seem likely to decelerate. Indeed, we are beginning to see hints of moderation in some of the data on housing prices. As a consequence, spending for new housing construction, after contributing nearly NUM/NUM percentage point to overall GDP growth DATE, may not increase much DATE. Moreover, the slowdown in house price increases could well hold back growth in consumption spending on a wide variety of goods and services. The rapid run-up in prices over DATE and hence in household wealth, perhaps combined with the increasing ease of tapping that wealth, probably has been a major reason that households have been saving so little of their current flow of income. As house-price appreciation slows, the personal saving rate likely should begin a gradual ascent. To be candid, however, the behavior of the housing market and the response of spending are among the great uncertainties about the economic outlook. I have sketched a benign scenario of gradual adjustment that lines up very nicely with the Federal Reserve's assessment that overall growth should slow to a sustainable pace. But our ability to predict asset prices is very limited, especially when the trajectory of those prices is shifting, as that of house prices appears to be doing right now. Moreover, we have particular difficulty in assessing how consumers will respond to changes in their perceptions of future capital gains and actual home prices. The housing market and its effects on spending will be among the areas that Tom and I and our colleagues on the FOMC will be monitoring most closely as we try to discern the emerging pattern of economic activity and inflation. At this time, even with housing markets cooling, the fundamentals remain favorable for solid gains over DATE in both consumer spending and business investment. In part, that assessment reflects the sizable increases in employment that we have been seeing over DATE. DATE, the Labor Department reported that payroll employment rose NUM,NUM in DATE. If the growth of aggregate demand moderates as we expect, increases in employment should also slow but still be sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market. Moreover, the gains in wage and salary income associated with those employment increases should provide ongoing support to household spending. The purchasing power of those gains will go further than it has in DATE if, as anticipated in futures markets, energy prices level out. Meanwhile, in the business sector, order books for nondefense capital goods are full, sales prospects appear good, profits have been strong, balance sheets are in healthy shape, and companies are flush with cash. As the growth of consumption eases back a little, so too should the increase in capital spending as firms come to anticipate slower growth in sales. But judging from rising global commodity prices and equity valuations abroad, foreign demand looks to be increasing, and rising exports should offset some of the scaling back of domestic sales prospects. In addition, technological advances will continue to boost demand for capital equipment by reducing its costs and increasing its usefulness in improving efficiency. If, as I anticipate, economic growth moderates a touch and pressures on labor and product markets do not intensify substantially further, I believe that underlying inflation should remain roughly stable. That sanguine picture is reinforced if crude oil prices do, in fact, turn out to be relatively flat over the remainder of DATE. Such a flattening of oil prices would reduce headline inflation directly and would diminish the threat of higher energy prices becoming more deeply embedded in the inflation process by raising inflation expectations. And, to date, inflation expectations have been well anchored. As I have already mentioned, it would not be surprising to see some pickup in TIME compensation, but such an acceleration may not add to price pressures. In DATE's competitive environment, and with profits generally robust, some of the cost increases might well be absorbed in margins. Moreover, further productivity gains should act to damp the effects on overall unit costs. Like all forecasts, this expectation of stable inflation is only the middle of a wide range of possible outcomes. For example, a further spurt in energy and commodity prices could be passed through into core inflation to a greater extent than seems to have been occurring recently; the threat of that outcome probably is especially great when the economy is already operating at a high level. If the economy does not moderate somewhat, pressures on resources will increase, further raising the odds of higher inflation. And as I discussed earlier, historical patterns suggest that resource utilization is already in a zone that at times has been associated with the emergence of inflation pressures. But the risks are not all one-sided. Price and compensation inflation have, in fact, remained moderate at high levels of resource utilization, despite rapid increases in energy and commodity prices, suggesting that some forces not yet fully identified may be helping to keep them contained. Those forces might include robust underlying productivity growth here at home or competition from abroad. It is also possible that the economy could cool more than expected if housing markets weaken quite substantially, consumption is cut back significantly, and as a consequence businesses pare capital spending plans. My job as a policymaker is to work with my colleagues to identify the path of short-term interest rates that has the best chance of realizing that favorable central-tendency forecast of solid growth and continued low inflation. I do not know how much policy firming will be needed to accomplish this objective. My forecast is that the economy is in transition to a sustainable pace of growth, in which case policy likely will be in transition as well. At this juncture, given the apparent strength in demand and the narrowing margin of unused resources, I am focused on making sure that inflation and inflation expectations remain well anchored. A tendency for inflation to move higher would put economic stability and the long-term performance of the economy at risk. Accordingly, for me, the critical indicators in the time ahead will be the ones that signal whether growth is indeed likely to proceed at a sustainable pace and whether inflation remains on a favorable track. This is a judgment my colleagues and I will need to make meeting by meeting as the incoming information--both the data and, critically, the timely feel for developments that we get from the Reserve Banks' contacts in the community--help us assess the paths for the economy and price pressures.",

                  "Donald L Kohn: Business capital spending Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Forecasters Club of New York Luncheon, New York, DATE.    The members of any group calling itself the Forecasters Club don't need an elaborate justification for my focus DATE on business fixed investment. The outlook for business investment is always a key element in any economic forecast. It can be a highly volatile component of aggregate demand, with variations in investment often accounting for a good share of the fluctuations in economic activity. That lesson was demonstrated again in DATE when strength in business investment contributed to the vigorous expansion of DATE, and then a marked and prolonged weakening in capital spending contributed to recession and sluggish growth in DATE and DATE. Business investment also has important implications for the supply side of the economy through its influence on the rate of increase in labor productivity and thus the economy's sustainable level of potential output. DATE, Chairman Bernanke talked to you about investment, laying out a structure for forecasting and using it to comment on the economic outlook. I thought that now would be a propitious moment to revisit the subject. What I would characterize as the standard forecast for DATE and next has the economy slowing a bit to trend. That slowing arises in substantial part from the effects that a cooling in housing markets has on residential construction and on consumption. But, at the same time, the standard forecast sees growth as being supported by a continued robust expansion of business investment. However, the range of views on investment seems a little wider than usual; the variation in large part reflects whether forecasters foresee a resolution of some apparent anomalies in investment behavior observed over DATE. In particular, the weakening in investment in DATE and DATE was larger and lasted longer than many had anticipated, and although investment growth has picked up in DATE, the level of investment has not fully recovered from the earlier weakness. My remarks DATE examine what we have--and have not--learned about this shortfall and what we might expect for business fixed investment over DATE. I must emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.NUM Business fixed investment has risen at a robust DATE rate of nearly NUM percent on average over DATE, and the real level of investment at DATE, $NUM trillion, was nearly NUM percent higher than the peak reached DATE. However, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded nearly NUM percent over DATE. To be sure, the investment peak in DATE was unusually high; still, the nominal share of business fixed investment in GDP, at NUM-NUM/NUM percent at DATE, was well below its DATE average. Of course, comparisons of these simple ratios and growth rates do not account for other influences on investment in the macroeconomic environment, such as interest rates, the prices of capital goods, or the rate of increase in final spending. However, a more rigorous exercise using a standard model favored by many forecasters yields a similar conclusion. Using lagged net investment, changes in business output, and changes in the user cost of capital to predict the level of current net investment, we find that the model did not forecast the plunge in investment in DATE. And, despite its ability to predict recent growth rates reasonably well, a dynamic simulation of such a model starting in DATE indicates that the current level of investment is still considerably lower than expected. To be sure, we would not have expected investment to snap back right away, judging from experience. Still, investment over DATE is showing no signs of returning to the path that we would have expected from historical relationships through DATE. Business financial statements also reflect evidence of restrained business spending behavior. Normally, businesses are heavy net users of savings generated by the rest of the economy. The financing gap--the level of capital spending over the level of internal funds--is a measure of that reliance. But it was close to zero in DATE and DATE and remained unusually low DATE (after adjustment for tax-induced flows of repatriated foreign earnings), which suggests that businesses didn't see enough profitable investment projects to warrant tapping the markets for external financing, even at low long-term interest rates. To be sure, profit margins and cash flow have been high, but that would also seem to be an environment that should encourage expansion. In fact, businesses appear to be using some of their very large holdings of cash for other purposes. Corporations have increased their share repurchases, which hit a record level DATE. They have also increased share retirements through cash-financed mergers and acquisitions, which have been boosted by a surge in buyouts. Evidently, corporate managers view prospective returns from these uses of cash flow as comparing favorably with those from new capital spending projects. The low level of investment has not been unique to the United States. Gross investment in other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was sluggish in DATE of this recovery, and the nominal share of nonresidential fixed investment in GDP in these countries is still barely higher than its twenty-five-year trough in DATE. This pattern persists despite a low cost of capital and ample cash flows in many countries as well as business sentiment that improved markedly DATE. Although real investment in Japan has moved up fairly steadily for DATE, capital spending was weak for DATE as profits were channeled to clean up balance sheets rather than expand productive capacity. Euro-area investment has also languished, in part because of relatively slow growth prospects. In both Japan and the euro area, investment likely also is being curtailed to some extent because of a demographic shift toward a more elderly population: As the share of the population that is of working age declines, the rise in the capital stock needed to equip the labor force decreases. Investment in the East Asian countries is still lower than before the crises of DATE, although investment rates in the region are generally higher than those in advanced economies. Also, lower rates of investment in some of these countries may reflect some shifting of production to China (where investment rates have been quite high in DATE). Ratios and equations are at best only rough guides to the investment that we might expect on the basis of past behavior in similar circumstances. Still, looking across a variety of indicators and a variety of countries, it does appear that the level of investment is unusually low for this stage of the business cycle. A more difficult task is determining why. As we shall see, there are a number of possible explanations, but no single one seems to hold the entire answer. An explanation that has received a great deal of attention is that a capital overhang, usually thought of as concentrated in high-tech equipment, developed in DATE and subsequently has been dragging down investment spending. In DATE, firms invested in high-tech goods at a very rapid pace, spurred at first by plunging prices and robust business output growth and eventually by an apparently overly optimistic view about the returns on those investments. Subsequently, high-tech investment dropped at a double-digit rate in DATE and fell further in DATE. This sharp decline, combined with the high depreciation rates on these types of goods, severely curtailed growth of the capital stock, and any overhang seems likely to have been eliminated relatively quickly. However, desired or optimal capital stocks are notoriously difficult to specify and measure, and hence so are overhangs, even DATE after the episode. Consequently, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the excess capital built up during DATE is restraining investment to some extent DATE. Another possibility is that business investment has been held down in DATE because relative prices of capital goods are no longer falling at the same pace at which they declined in DATE. At least some of the deceleration may reflect a slowing pace of technological improvement--that is, less-rapid downward shifts in the supply curve of capital goods. However, to the extent that these price changes are well measured and our econometric models are well specified, the implications of slower price declines should already be captured by our models. In addition, the effects of less rapidly falling prices on the growth rate of the user cost of capital appears to have been substantially offset over much of this period by declines in real interest rates. Another explanation that received attention in DATE of this decade is that businesses were unusually cautious after the most recent recession in expanding their productive capacity. Both hiring and capital investment lagged the usual recovery pace. One possible source of this caution was said to be questions about the strength and sustainability of the recovery, accentuated by concerns about terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainties. Many periods of recovery have been accompanied by concerns about economic growth and political turmoil. But surveys suggest that managers did experience a prolonged sense of gloom, with measures of sentiment dropping to low levels and staying that way for DATE or two beyond the business cycle trough. However, the economy has been expanding at an above-trend pace for DATE now, and the durability of the recovery should no longer be an issue. Indeed, most surveys of business confidence and capital spending plans have reached, and in some cases exceeded, the levels of DATE. Still another possibility is that conditions created by corporate governance scandals and the regulatory response to those events led firms to hold back on capital spending. The scandals and the market's reaction were said to have contributed to a more conservative attitude toward risk taking. Moreover, complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of DATE may have affected capital spending as firms scrambled to meet the DATE and DATE deadlines. Clearly, compliance costs have been substantial, perhaps diverting funds and attention away from capital spending plans. However, capital spending to update information systems to address the enhanced auditing needs may be offsetting at least a portion of any damping effect the legislation may have had. In any event, the market effects of corporate governance scandals appear to have faded DATE. And, at larger companies, where systems have been adapted to the new requirements, compliance now should be more routine, freeing time and attention to concentrate on business strategy and expansion. If these types of influences have had any restraining effects, they should be receding. Changing replacement cycles are another potential downward influence on the pace of investment. Before DATE, many firms invested in new technologies to replace those not compatible with DATE date change. This effort tended to speed up replacement cycles (and thus depreciation), boosting gross investment at that time. The resulting bunching of purchases may have contributed to the drop-off in investment in DATE as firms with relatively new, efficient capital goods saw less reason to upgrade. Also, during DATE and DATE, anecdotal reports suggested that many firms saw no need to upgrade equipment because no compelling new technology or application had been released, which would have tended to lengthen the replacement cycle. If replacement cycles since then have remained longer than in DATE, firms would respond with a lower level of gross investment. And, anecdotes and surveys suggest that replacement cycles have in fact lengthened in DATE compared with DATE. But the implied drop in the rate of depreciation is much too small to explain the low-investment puzzle. Some have posited that low investment in the United States reflects firms' decisions to meet expanding demand by investing overseas rather than at home. Economic theory suggests that in countries where labor is cheap and abundant, all else equal, we would expect the marginal product of capital to be relatively high, making these economies attractive places in which to invest. Thus, countries such as China ought to be seeing an influx of direct investment. However, the dollar value of U.S. direct investment into China averaged about $NUM billion per year in DATE, much less than NUM percent of domestic investment spending and not enough to be a major influence on investment spending trends. Looking at flows to all developing economies, the share of outward direct investment going to these destinations has been about flat over DATE. Foreign direct investment, as a whole, has been rising relative to domestic investment, but gradually over DATE--a trend that was not picked up in DATE. Clearly, none of these explanations is the sole cause of the relatively restrained level of investment. Most likely, some combination of these factors along with others we have not identified accounted for the sharp decline in investment in DATE and DATE and has contributed to keeping investment spending rising along a lower track subsequently, both domestically and abroad. However, as I noted, several of those factors are of questionable quantitative import, and others no longer seem to provide a rationale for the failure of investment spending to rebound more vigorously. Yet, most indicators in hand do not point to a surge in business fixed investment that will restore the trend derived from earlier relationships. Instead, the latest reads on business spending and intentions point to continued solid growth in capital spending, supported by favorable fundamentals of steady increases in final demand and a relatively damped cost of capital. Over DATE, both orders and shipments of capital equipment (excluding the volatile aircraft category) have continued to move up at roughly the steady pace seen since DATE. Moreover, orders remained above shipments in the first quarter of DATE, leading to another increase in the backlog of orders. In addition, surveys indicate that businesses' capital spending plans and their outlook for sales remain, on balance, in the elevated range that they have occupied for DATE. A slowing in the growth of consumption and residential investment associated with a cooling in the housing market will exert some restraint on capital investment, but business sales should receive some support from improved markets for our exports. Moreover, business spending on structures finally seems to be picking up momentum. The construction data that we have in hand for DATE suggest a bounceback from the anemic growth in spending on nonresidential buildings that has prevailed over DATE. This pickup should persist, responding to the recent declines in office and industrial vacancy rates. And expenditures on drilling and mining structures are likely to remain strong, given the current market expectations for elevated energy prices. Spending on structures should also get a boost DATE from rebuilding in the areas hard hit by DATE's hurricanes. The outlook for solid increases in investment spending has both upside and downside risks associated with it. On the downside, the cooling off that we are currently observing in housing markets could become more severe, and both residential construction and consumer spending could take a larger hit than expected. A substantial slowing in these two categories of final demand would likely induce some businesses to curtail or delay investment projects. On the upside, we cannot say exactly why the level of investment has remained low for DATE, so we certainly cannot rule out a return to previous higher trends. In that regard, we do seem to be seeing a strengthening in global demand, which could signal a more pervasive change in attitudes and expectations. Because capital spending influences not only aggregate demand DATE but also influences aggregate supply and productivity over the medium term, it is a key element of any forecast. The focus in current commentary is mostly on the outlook for housing and consumption, but I suspect that business fixed investment will again play a central role in shaping the path of the economy. The experience of DATE does not seem to have greatly clarified the reasons for the extent of the fall in investment in DATE and DATE and its subsequent failure to return to previous trends. The persisting puzzle has the effect of increasing uncertainty around any projection. But it also suggests the potential for substantial returns to further analysis and research for forecasters, like those in this club and us in the Federal Reserve.",

                  "Mark W Olson: Recent economic experience and outlook Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Fraser Institute Roundtable Luncheon, Toronto, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak to you DATE about my assessment of current economic conditions in the United States and what is required to maintain an economic environment conducive to growth, job creation, and price stability. I should note that my remarks DATE reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System. Commentaries on the economy often focus too heavily on DATE and DATE data. To put DATE's economic performance in a broader context, I would like to step back briefly and touch on some recent economic history. As you know, the latter half of the 1990s was a time of remarkable economic performance, fueled importantly by an investment boom that contributed to rapid growth in labor productivity. However, by DATE, that boom had come to an end, and businesses abruptly curtailed capital spending - particularly for high-tech equipment. The cutback in spending occurred as expectations about the potential profitability of new investment opportunities turned down, and many companies, such as those in the telecommunications sector, found that they had invested too much in equipment and office space during the boom. With the sudden drop-off in business demand, inventories began to pile up, and producers cut production of all types of goods in DATE. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve reduced the target rate for the federal funds rate sharply over the course of DATE to contain the weakness and head off a more serious deterioration following the terrorist attacks in DATE. This monetary policy stance, coupled with stimulative fiscal policy, was generally successful. In contrast to most U.S. recessions since World War II, consumer spending and residential investment were both relatively well maintained during this period. Even as firms cut employment and stock market losses eroded household wealth throughout DATE and DATE, household spending was supported by tax cuts, low inflation, and low interest rates. Consumers took advantage of falling mortgage rates to buy new homes, to refinance their existing mortgage debt, and to tap into their increasing home equity to pay off more expensive debt or to finance spending on other things. As a result, the recession in DATE turned out to be quite shallow, and activity in DATE recovered modestly even though businesses continued to cut spending on capital and reduce employment throughout DATE. Despite the reduction in business investment, significant improvements in efficiency allowed firms to meet their sales and production goals without having to add workers. These improvements seem to have been the result both of organizational changes in business operations and of innovations in the use of existing technologies, perhaps the result of firms applying more effectively the new technologies they had acquired at a rapid pace in DATE. In DATE, the recovery took hold: The pace of consumer expenditures stepped up, and housing activity boomed. These developments were supported by a pickup in personal income growth as job losses abated and TIME compensation moved up, as well as by rising stock market and housing wealth. In addition, the caution and uncertainty that had weighed on businesses began to dissipate, and investment turned up in DATE. A marked increase in capital spending in DATE was spurred by significantly improving profits, low interest rates, and investment tax incentives. Nonetheless, the recovery remained \"jobless\" until the fall, when growth in private employment began to resume. Output in DATE continued to expand at the robust pace of DATE, and employment gains picked up sharply. However, economic activity hit a soft patch in DATE: The growth of real gross domestic product slowed to an DATE rate of NUM-NUM/NUM percent in DATE after posting a NUM-NUM/NUM percent average pace in DATE and over the four quarters of DATE. The DATE slowing was particularly evident in consumption, which was nearly unchanged on average DATE. Furthermore, job gains in the private sector, which had averaged close to NUM,NUM per month between DATE and DATE, slowed to about NUM,NUM per month on average during DATE. Economic developments DATE have undoubtedly been influenced by the steep run-up in oil prices from about $NUM per barrel for West Texas intermediate crude oil in December DATE to a record level of $NUM per barrel DATE. This rise in energy prices clearly has had a negative effect on the real purchasing power of households and has raised business costs. Nevertheless, the United States is probably less vulnerable to DATE's oil price shock than it was to the shocks of DATE and DATE, both because energy represents a smaller share of household purchases and business input costs than in those earlier periods and because the higher oil prices reflect, in part, stronger growth in the rest of the world, which in turn provides an offset in the form of higher demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, the most recent data suggest that the U.S. economy has regained some vigor in the second half of DATE. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP expanded at an DATE rate of NUM percent in DATE, and final sales grew at the fastest pace in a DATE. In particular, real consumer spending rebounded, as households responded to the aggressive incentives offered by motor vehicle companies by sharply increasing their purchases of new cars and trucks. In addition, low mortgage rates have helped sustain a high level of demand for new homes, and business investment in equipment and software posted another robust gain, led by a sharp increase in spending on non-high-tech equipment. Available indicators for DATE seem a little more mixed, but the general consensus of economic forecasters is that real GDP will expand in DATE at a pace similar to that in DATE. Although real incomes continue to be squeezed by significantly higher energy prices, recent spending indicators, including DATE retail sales report, suggest that consumption was well maintained in DATE. In addition, housing construction and home sales have been maintained at a robust pace in DATE, and recent declines in mortgage rates should continue to support demand. Business demand for high-tech equipment seems to have softened a little in DATE, judging both from the data on new orders and from industry commentary. However, business investment on non-high-tech equipment should be buoyed by strong fundamentals, including low interest rates and strong corporate balance sheets, as well as by the partial-expensing provisions of the current tax code, which encourage businesses to accelerate investment spending on longer-lived equipment to take advantage of the temporary tax incentive before it expires at the end of the DATE. Presumably reflecting these factors, bookings for non-high-tech capital goods have been on a steep uptrend in DATE. The latest reading on the labor market, which has been a source of uncertainty for some time, was particularly encouraging. After slowing DATE, employment on private nonfarm payrolls rose nearly NUM,NUM in DATE, about the same as the robust pace reported during DATE of DATE. DATE's increase was boosted somewhat by a sizable increase in construction employment, which was partly related to rebuilding and cleanup activity following DATE's hurricanes. But even so, the pace of hiring picked up for a wide range of other industries as well. That said, recent surveys and the continued, low level of labor force participation suggest that households remain concerned about a lack of employment opportunities, and we will have to wait and see whether this faster pace of hiring can be sustained. As you know, Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, and hence trade provides an important link between our economies. Indeed, U.S. exports to Canada are rising briskly so far DATE, albeit still not quite as fast as the rise in U.S. imports from Canada. More generally, a surge in Canadian exports has helped fuel the recovery in Canada DATE despite an appreciation of the Canadian dollar. However, unlike the United States, Canada is a net exporter of oil and other commodities and thus has also benefited, on balance, from the sustained rise in oil and other commodity prices DATE. Recent Canadian data are consistent with robust domestic demand growth in DATE, and employment gains have recently been strong. Over time, future improvements along these lines may also support higher demand for imports, which will in part come from the United States. Turning to the outlook for U.S. inflation, the rise in crude oil prices - coupled with rising margins for gasoline and higher prices for natural gas - contributed to a NUM percent DATE rate of increase in consumer energy prices over the first half of the DATE. And, although energy prices turned down briefly during DATE as gasoline margins returned to more normal levels, the latest indicators are pointing to significant increases in energy prices again DATE. As a result, headline consumer price inflation - as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - rose at an DATE rate of around NUM-NUM/NUM percent over the first three quarters of DATE, up from NUM-NUM/NUM percent in each of the past three DATEs. Despite the rise in oil prices, core consumer prices have risen at a moderate pace in DATE after picking up early DATE from last DATE's very low rate. On average, core PCE prices have increased at a NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE rate over the first three quarters of DATE, up only slightly from a NUM-NUM/NUM percent increase over the four quarters of DATE. As with the real economy, the absence of a more significant effect from oil prices on core inflation reflects, in part, the smaller share of energy in firms' production processes. But in addition, the Federal Reserve's commitment to low inflation seems to have limited the pass-through of higher energy prices to wages and inflation expectations. Indeed, despite some rapid increases in benefit costs - most notably for health insurance and defined benefit pension plans - overall TIME compensation has been rising at roughly a NUM percent DATE rate DATE, similar to last DATE's pace. Similarly, surveys of inflation expectations and implied inflation compensation from Treasury indexed security yields suggest that longer-term inflation expectations have been well anchored over this period, and short-term inflation expectations have actually eased on balance since midDATE despite the rise in energy prices. Looking ahead, economic fundamentals are consistent with the U.S. economy posting solid growth over the next DATE. Indeed, most forecasters expect that output will continue to rise next DATE at a pace similar to DATE's. For example, the most recent Blue Chip forecast sees output rising at a NUM-NUM/NUM percent rate in DATE, just a touch slower than their forecast for growth over the four quarters of DATE. With regard to inflation, the Blue Chip participants see the rise in the consumer price index slowing from NUM percent DATE to NUM percent over the four quarters of DATE. There are a number of reasons for this reasonably favorable outlook. First, monetary policy remains accommodative, even with the rise of NUM basis points in the federal funds rate since DATE. The nominal federal funds rate is currently NUM percent, a level that, using standard measures of core consumer price inflation, implies a real funds rate that is just above zero - considerably lower than the long-run average of about NUM-NUM/NUM percent. Of course, this long-run average may differ from the level of the real federal funds rate that is currently consistent with moving economic activity into line with its potential and keeping inflation low and stable. But even taking into account possible factors that would tend to push down the equilibrium rate - for example, business pessimism, energy prices, and our net export position - the real funds rate still seems low. Second, financial conditions in general look to be supportive of continued solid economic expansion. In addition to benchmark real interest rates being low, risk spreads are quite narrow, and lenders appear very willing to provide credit to businesses and households. Moreover, many businesses, through their actions to repair their balance sheets in recent DATEs, have built up large holdings of cash that can be tapped to finance investment outlays, and the substitution of long-term debt for short-term debt has reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates. Third, robust growth in underlying productivity should continue to support income growth and economic activity. I suspect that productivity will eventually slow from the extraordinary pace of the past few DATEs - indeed, the recent figures offer some evidence that some of the slowing has already occurred. Nonetheless, I am optimistic that part of the step-up in productivity will be sustained and that it will be reinforced by a robust pace of capital spending. Continued solid gains in productivity will be an important plus for our economy over the longer run because faster increases in productivity lead over time to higher profits, wages, and living standards. On the inflation front, the best news is that inflation is expected to be relatively low. With inflation expectations well anchored, the existing amount of slack and underlying strength in productivity should be offsetting pressures from indirect energy effects and other commodity price increases, which themselves should diminish as oil prices stabilize and then begin to decline. Nevertheless, and as always seems to be the case, there are considerable uncertainties surrounding the outlook for real activity and inflation. An obvious source of risk for the U.S. expansion continues to be the behavior of energy prices. As I noted, the steep run-up in crude oil prices DATE has significantly restrained real activity and pushed up overall inflation. And, the outlook for oil prices remains uncertain. Higher oil prices have damped the consumption of oil in the United States, but growing concerns about long-term supply, along with large prospective increases in demand from the rapidly growing economies of China, India, and other emerging-market economies have fueled an increase in futures prices of oil. In DATE, spot prices have eased back from mid-DATE's record levels, and market participants in oil futures markets seem to expect spot prices to ease somewhat further over the next two DATEs. But both the global demand for oil and the availability of new supplies are notoriously difficult to predict. Another uncertainty revolves around the effect of current tax policy on economic activity. Fiscal policy, which has been stimulative DATE, is expected to shift to a fairly neutral stance in DATE, following the removal of the partial-expensing provision for various capital goods at the end of DATE. Because the partial-expensing provision allows firms to subtract a large share of the cost of new capital equipment from profits right away, rather than depreciating the cost over time, it provides an incentive to firms to invest in new capital goods. However, estimates of the quantitative effect of this tax incentive on investment are highly uncertain. And anecdotal evidence that firms are responding to the partial-expensing provision is not clear-cut. As a result, the impact of its removal is equally unclear. Specifically, if partial expensing is having a very limited effect on firms' investment decisions, recent increases in business spending on equipment would be consistent with a stronger underlying pace of investment and faster GDP growth next DATE. Finally, the sustainability of expansion will depend importantly on the pace of improvement in the labor market. To be sure, DATE's payroll employment report was a positive sign. But as we saw earlier DATE, DATE of data does not make a trend. Robust job gains in DATE would be a convincing sign that businesses have become more confident about the future course of the expansion and would provide households with the wherewithal to maintain a healthy pace of spending growth. Let me turn finally to a brief discussion of monetary policy. As I noted earlier, monetary policy has played an important role in providing support for the economy in recent DATEs. But our work is not done. Now that the expansion seems to have taken hold, we face the challenge of making the transition to a policy stance more appropriate for sustained economic expansion. Our goal is to do so in a way that maximizes economic growth while sustaining the progress that we have made in achieving price stability. Keeping inflation low and stable will contribute importantly to sustaining financial conditions conducive for further gains in economic activity. Along these lines, the FOMC has raised the target federal funds rate by NUM basis points at each of our last four meetings. As indicated in its most recent statement, the FOMC continues to support the assessment that removal of accommodation will likely proceed at a measured pace. However, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability, and it is those developments that will ultimately determine the level and term structure of interest rates.",

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Factors influencing business investment Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Greater Issues Series, The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak DATE as part of the Citadel's Greater Issues Series. I will speak about one of the forces likely to shape developments in the U.S. economy. In past speeches, I have addressed the so-called jobless recovery, trade, global imbalances, and national saving. DATE, I round out this series on fundamental issues by reviewing business capital investment - that is, spending by businesses on such things as machines, computers, and new buildings. Although it makes up only about NUM percent of gross domestic product, business investment is a vital element of the U.S. economy, with important implications for a variety of broader economic issues. Investment has a large influence on DATE-to-year fluctuations in economic activity. During the past six recessions, the drop in domestic investment has generally accounted for most of the decline in GDP. Business investment was a major factor in both DATE economic expansion and the subsequent recession. In fact, the decline in business outlays on investment goods in DATE was even larger than the downturn in the overall economy. Although overall GDP edged down at an average DATE rate of only NUM percent in the first three quarters of DATE, the decline in business investment subtracted nearly NUM percentage points from GDP growth over that period. Clearly, some insight into investment swings would enable us to better understand the economic cycles of recessions and expansions, which in turn have such a big effect on job creation, the budget deficit, and a host of other important issues. Business investment also affects the broader economy through labor productivity - or output per hour of work. Over DATE, the average TIME output of American workers has increased nearly NUM percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than one-third of this improved efficiency likely reflects increases in the use of capital goods. Over DATE, efficiency gains due to increased capital expenditures have been especially pronounced. Because rising productivity is the primary means through which standards of living increase, capital investment is clearly an important part of the economic engine. Accordingly, an understanding of investment is critical for insight into both cyclical and longer-run economic developments. In my discussion DATE, I want to address the outlook for the three categories of business investment: equipment and software, structures, and inventories. Forecasting business investment is complicated, however. Despite the importance of this subject, the policymakers, academics, and business economists who study it have limited knowledge regarding its behavior and the factors determining that behavior. By highlighting some of the thorny issues that need to be considered, I hope to provide a backdrop to help elucidate the likely performance of business investment in the quarters to come. Although forecasting involves considerable uncertainty, I think that the prospects for business investment over DATE are, on balance, relatively positive. I should note, of course, that the comments that I make DATE reflect only my own views; they should not be taken to represent the views of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System. Equipment and software The largest component of business investment is expenditures on new equipment and software. This category includes computers, routers and switches, machinery, aircraft, trucks, software, and a wide variety of other types of equipment that are used to produce goods and services. Decisions of business people regarding equipment and software investment are based on their assessment of business prospects, the nature of the capital goods themselves, and financing conditions. In short, potential purchasers of business equipment will need to assess a plethora of variables that are at best known only imperfectly. For economists who forecast investment, the task is even harder: Not only must we form opinions about all these variables, we must try to discern the business community's response to them. Currently, demand for business products and services appears to be rising. In addition, interest rates remain low, and the business sector has ample cash on hand. Historically, such conditions have been associated with increasing real business spending on equipment and software. At the moment, however, at least four additional factors are clouding our view. First, after the trough of the last recession, businesses seemed more hesitant than usual to expand their productive capabilities. Concerns about terrorism, war, and corporate governance scandals may have made it harder for firms to have confidence that a robust and durable recovery was under way. With heightened uncertainty, many firms may have been reluctant to increase capital spending. The issue we face now, DATE since the trough, is whether this reluctance has abated. The evidence we have for ongoing business hesitancy is suggestive but far from conclusive. One piece of evidence is found in the state of the \"financing gap\" - the difference between a firm's capital expenditures and its cash flow, or internal funds. In the past, the financing gap for nonfinancial corporations was almost always positive - that is, capital spending was larger than internal funds. DATE, the financing gap rose from less than $NUM billion to a peak of more than $NUM billion. The rapid rise largely reflected sharp increases in capital expenditures in the telecommunications, high-tech, and transportation industries that greatly outstripped the increases in internally-generated funds. However, the financing gap fell abruptly in DATE and DATE, turned negative DATE, and has stayed below zero since then. This negative financing gap, which is widespread across industries, indicates that the business sector as a whole is generating enough cash to purchase capital expenditures without borrowing. In fact, because it has been negative for a while, the gap has contributed to the accumulation of a large cushion of liquid assets. Over DATE and DATE, liquid assets in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose $NUM billion, or more than NUM percent, to $NUM trillion. This news is good because it means that business balance sheets are in good shape and financial conditions are not holding back business investment. But the news is also troubling. Given the current low interest rates, the preference for holding financial assets over expanding operations suggests that businesses lack confidence in the future profitability of their potential ventures. The negative financing gap could very well be a sign that businesses remain cautious about the outlook - a condition that, unfortunately, can become a self-fulfilling prophesy. A second factor that complicates the outlook for investment is the state of the computer sector. About NUM percent of business spending on equipment and software is for computer gear. Some of that spending is to equip new plants and new employees, but a large share of it is to replace old machines and outdated technology. Over DATE, we have seen technology advance rapidly, and businesses have purchased a large amount of high-tech equipment. More recently, the growth rate of business spending on computers has slowed - from about NUM percent DATE to less than half that pace, on average, in DATE. One possible explanation is that we are seeing a deceleration in the pace of technical advancement. Technological progress affects business investment in primarily two ways. First, it changes how businesses organize their operations. Second, even innovations that do not spur an entirely new way of doing business can encourage equipment spending because some firms will choose to retire obsolete equipment more rapidly than they otherwise would. Accordingly, if the pace of progress slows, increases in business investment, particularly of high-tech goods, may also slow. Of course, we cannot directly measure the pace of technological progress, but we can look at some indicators to help us judge. One indicator that economists often look at is prices, particularly \"qualityadjusted prices\" compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to deflate nominal computer expenditures. Over time, these quality-adjusted prices tend to fall, as computers and related equipment become more and more powerful. Between NUM and DATE, the quality-adjusted price of new computers fell at an DATE rate of NUM percent. The speed at which these prices fall reflects mainly the pace of technological progress. Unfortunately, over DATE, the rate of price decline slowed from that experienced during DATE: Computer equipment prices fell just NUM percent at an DATE rate in DATE and DATE. Although we cannot be certain, at least some of this deceleration may represent some slowing in the rapid pace of technological improvement. Indeed, detailed data that we use in putting together the industrial production data suggest that the number of new PC models introduced DATE has fallen markedly from the pace posted in DATE, suggesting that the pace of innovation, at least in this one market, has slowed. A third factor for economists considering the outlook for the business sector is the question of whether the existing stock of business equipment is too high. As the high-tech boom of DATE was ending, many observers claimed that companies had been overly optimistic and had purchased too many PCs and peripherals and laid too much fiber optic cable, resulting in an actual capital stock that exceeded the desired level for business. When such a \"capital overhang\" emerges, new investment spending tends to be curtailed for a while. Indeed, in DATE and DATE, real outlays for equipment and software fell at an DATE rate of nearly NUM percent. Determining whether a capital overhang exists is difficult, and estimates of the size of overhangs are subject to considerable error. First, capital stocks are hard to measure; although we know the amount of new capital goods purchased, we can only roughly estimate the rate of economic depreciation and obsolescence. Consequently, we cannot know with certainty the level of the existing capital that is still available to be used. Second, we do not know how much capital firms would ideally like to employ because their expectations and production processes are always changing. Of course, we can estimate both actual and desired capital stocks, but these estimates are quite dependent on our assumptions, especially our assumptions about technological change. Based on the depreciation rates used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, we estimate that the growth rate of the capital stock of equipment and software slowed from around NUM percent in DATE and DATE to about NUM-NUM/NUM percent in DATE, a slowdown large enough to substantially shrink most estimates of the capital overhang. The final factor that complicates the outlook for equipment and software spending stems from the tax code. Currently, the partial-expensing provision in the tax law allows a firm to subtract a large fraction of the cost of new capital equipment from profits right away, rather than depreciating the cost over time, and thereby to lower its taxes. The partial-expensing provision, which provides an incentive to invest in new capital goods, will expire at the end of DATE. The impending expiration is probably boosting investment spending in the second half of DATE as firms rush to take the tax advantage before it disappears; however, at this point the evidence is not conclusive. The anecdotal evidence on whether firms are responding to the partial-expensing provision is sparse and somewhat contradictory. According to a summary of commentary on current economic conditions prepared by the San Francisco Fed in DATE, a number of contacted firms planned increases in capital spending, yet there was no mention of partial expensing. In contrast, a recent special question in the Philadelphia Fed's Business Outlook Survey showed that about one-quarter of respondents thought that the tax provision was likely to boost their spending DATE. The statistical evidence for a tax response is also inconclusive. Shipments of long-lived equipment (which should be more favorably affected than demand for short-lived equipment) have increased more than overall capital spending since the passage of the most recent version of the partial-expensing law - the pattern we would expect to see if businesses were taking advantage of the tax incentive. However, other explanations for this pattern are possible, and the difference between the long-lived and the short-lived categories is neither statistically significant nor terribly robust. The evidence that partial expensing is having an effect is not clear-cut, but my view is that capital spending is probably being influenced by the tax law and that its expiration in DATE will probably damp outlays in the early part of DATE. Nonresidential structures Besides spending on equipment and software, businesses also build and purchase nonresidential structures. Although this category - which includes factories, warehouses, shopping malls, oil wells, cell phone towers, fiber optic cable tunnels, office parks, and more - is only about NUM percent as large as the equipment and software category, it too can contribute to swings in GDP. In DATE and DATE, expenditures for new business structures declined more than $NUM billion, subtracting nearly NUM⁄NUM percentage point from DATE GDP growth on average in DATE. After having flattened out DATE, spending in this sector appears to have turned up recently. Business outlays on structures rose NUM percent in DATE, and construction data indicate that the sector expanded further in DATE DATE. Still, nonresidential structures are notoriously difficult to project with any certainty. Many sectors of the economy wax and wane along with the overall business cycle, but the structures sector tends to follow long cycles of its own. Although a weak economy is generally detrimental to spending in this category, expenditures often continue to increase well into an economic downturn, making forecasting difficult. In addition, the nonresidential structures category includes a diverse set of buildings, and forecasting this sector requires keeping tabs on a wide variety of indicators. Purchases of one of the largest components, commercial buildings, tend to be associated with conditions in the retail sector. Retail rents rose NUM percent in DATE that ended in DATE, the fastest pace in DATE, and the vacancy rate remains below NUM percent. Likewise, indicators for spending on drilling and mining wells, which usually rise after a jump in oil and natural gas prices, look quite strong. However, the outlook for outlays on office buildings, which tend to be correlated with activity and hiring in the business services sectors as well as in the finance and insurance industries, is less upbeat: Office rents have continued to fall, and the vacancy rate, at NUM percent, remains elevated. The vacancy rate for industrial buildings, a sector that generally keeps pace with manufacturing activity, has flattened out around NUM percent over DATE after having risen markedly for DATE. Thus, at the moment, the various indicators are giving fairly mixed signals. However, the mixed signals are still an improvement over the almost uniformly negative tone of the markets for nonresidential structures DATE. To me, they suggest that the nascent upturn in this sector is likely to continue. Inventory investment So far I have discussed business fixed investment. Another important part of capital expenditures, however, is inventory investment. There are three types of inventory investment: materials and supplies, work in progress, and finished goods. In dollar terms, inventory investment is not large: From NUM to DATE, it averaged about $NUM billion - less than NUM percent of GDP. However, because it can swing from a sizable positive as firms stockpile goods in DATE to a pronounced negative when they clear out the warehouses in DATE, the change in business inventories is generally considered to be one of the most important categories for understanding business-cycle volatility. The reasons that firms need to hold inventory stocks, unlike their reasons for investing in capital equipment and buildings, are not always obvious. For manufacturers, more than half of all inventories are held in the form of materials and supplies or as work in progress. These inventories are necessary, of course, to facilitate production. However, even inventories of finished goods are important. Businesses need to weigh the cost of running out of an item - perhaps forcing a customer to turn to a competitor - against the storage costs of carrying inventories from DATE. And, particularly in the retail sector, inventories of some goods - like clothing and cars - can spur sales because customers have the chance to try out different sizes or option packages before buying. With so many reasons for holding inventories, inventory investment may appear about as difficult to predict as investment in equipment or structures. It is probably even more difficult. So far I have mentioned only the reasons for which businesses intentionally change their inventory holdings. But inventory swings are often the result of miscalculations on the part of business owners. If a particular product is unexpectedly popular, inventories get drawn down; if the product is unpopular, inventories pile up. The situation is complicated for economists who are trying to draw inferences from flows into and out of inventories. We need not only to figure out how much inventory businesses have wanted to hold but also to discern when they have been surprised by sales. The difficulty of this task can be illustrated by the most recent period. In DATE of DATE, businesses accumulated inventory stocks at a rapid pace, after having kept inventories relatively lean for DATE. This acceleration in the pace of accumulation could mean that inventories had finally gotten too lean and that firms wanted to re-stock, or it could mean only that businesses were startled by the unexpectedly weak pace of demand for their products and that inventories piled up unintentionally. Answering this question is important for determining what is likely to happen to inventory building for the rest of DATE. How do we begin to gauge whether businesses wanted to rebuild inventories in DATE? One way is to look at the ratio of inventories to sales. In the nonfarm sector, this ratio has fallen nearly NUM percent in DATE, from DATE supply to DATE supply. Most likely this secular decline represents improvements in inventory management, possibly related to better technology. In DATE, the inventory-sales ratio fell especially sharply, dropping from NUM to NUM, or about NUM percent. Part of the decline likely reflected improvements in inventory-management techniques. However, unless the pace of technological change has improved markedly, the drop in the inventory-sales ratio probably also reflected sales outstripping the cautious expectations of businesses. The implication is that inventories may have been a bit on the lean side in the first part of DATE. If so, then some of the inventory accumulation in DATE may have been an intentional re-stocking of inventories that had become too lean. Survey results from the Institute of Supply Management support this conjecture. For DATE, a majority of respondents had said that their customers' inventories were too low. The most recent data, however, suggest that many supply managers have reassessed that view, and the mix of those who think customers' inventories are lean has moved more in line with those who think stocks are excessive. Thus, the recent upturn in inventory investment does not seem to be pointing toward another problematic inventory cycle, with its accompanying need to drastically reduce production to eliminate unwanted stocks. At the same time, the bulk of stock rebuilding appears to be behind us so that inventories are unlikely to be a major spur to GDP growth in the near future. Conclusions DATE, I have highlighted some of the issues that continue to challenge economists in evaluating the outlook for business investment, an extremely important element in determining the outlook for the economy more broadly. With respect to investment in equipment and software, although we do not know with certainty just how rapidly technology is changing and how much businesses are expecting to sell and produce in the future, a number of indicators can help explain recent trends and likely developments. At this point, although there is uncertainty, these indicators on balance suggest that the outlook in this sector is relatively positive. Regarding nonresidential structures, the mixed indicators are a distinct improvement over the negative outlook of DATE. And, regarding business inventories, the recent upturn in inventory investment does not appear to be problematic, but it seems unlikely that further inventory investment will impart significant forward momentum to the economy. In short, although the economy may not experience the outsized growth rates of high-tech equipment spending or other business investment seen in DATE, the fundamental features of the current U.S. economy argue for solid increases in the capital expenditures needed to produce and facilitate sales. With steady contributions from business investment, GDP growth is likely to continue expanding at a good pace, leading to further job gains and increases in family incomes. And in the longer run, the expansion of the capital stock can be expected to continue improving the efficiency of the American worker and thus to lead to additional increases in the standard of living.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: The economic outlook Remarks by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Maryland Bankers Association First Friday Economic Outlook Forum, Baltimore, Maryland, DATE.    I am pleased to be here at the beginning of DATE to offer my assessment of recent economic developments and the economic outlook for DATE. I also plan to discuss the actions that the Federal Reserve has been taking to support the economic recovery. Before I begin, I want to emphasize that the views that I will be presenting are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Board of Governors. Recent economic and financial developments In DATE, the U.S. economy began to emerge from the deepest recession of the post-World War II period - one that had been precipitated by a severe financial crisis. Economic history teaches that such downturns typically are deeper, and that the pace of their subsequent recoveries is more moderate, than is the case for business cycles not associated with financial crises. Certainly, that has been the U.S. experience for DATE: Real economic activity has been steadily recovering overall, but the speed and strength of the rebound have been restrained by significant financial headwinds. Perhaps the most telling measure of the modest pace of the economic recovery is the painfully slow improvement in the labor market. To be sure, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the data. Indicators of hiring and job openings have continued to rise in DATE, and, more recently, new claims for unemployment insurance have begun falling again. Still, DATE into recovery, there are more than NUM million fewer jobs in the economy than there were just prior to the recession, and the unemployment rate remains stubbornly close to its peak. American families have not experienced such a prolonged and severe period of unemployment since DATE. On a positive note, the recent news on production and spending offers some encouragement that the expansion may be gaining traction. Manufacturing production, which rebounded sharply during DATE of the recovery, has continued to expand at a solid rate in DATE. Importantly, while earlier gains in factory production were supported largely by the rebuilding of business inventories, the recent increases represent a strengthening in domestic demand for domestically produced goods. Moreover, with the recovery in economic activity abroad, exports have also been providing a boost to our manufacturing sector. Consumer spending, which rose at only a modest rate in DATE of the recovery, has strengthened in DATE. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), adjusted for inflation, increased at an DATE rate of NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE, with sales increasing across a relatively broad range of consumer goods and services. The pickup included an increase in purchases of autos and light trucks that, in turn, prompted automakers to increase their assembly schedules for DATE. And while we don't have DATE data yet, initial reports of holiday spending have been strong. Nonetheless, even with the recent pickup, consumer spending has not provided its usual cyclical boost to the recovery, as households have been restrained by the substantial loss of wealth they sustained during the financial crisis, persistently high unemployment, and reduced availability of credit. The good news is that some of these restraints have been easing: Rising stock prices have been helping rebuild household wealth, the ratio of debt to income has come down, and delinquency rates on consumer loans have been falling. The supply of consumer credit has also improved somewhat over DATE, although the terms and conditions for some types of consumer loans are still tight relative to historical norms. Business investment in equipment and software, which rebounded strongly early in the recovery, continued to post solid gains through the fall. The health of larger firms with access to capital markets has shown steady improvement over DATE. Operating earnings per share for S&P NUM firms have been rising, net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations has been increasing, and indicators of corporate credit quality have continued to improve. For these firms, the outlook appears positive: Recent surveys of purchasing managers across a range of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms indicated an increase in their plans for capital spending in DATE. In contrast, for small businesses, the situation has been more difficult. Surveys of bank lending indicate that banks are no longer tightening credit terms for loans to small businesses, but interest rates on small business loans remain high relative to market rates, and outstanding volumes of small loans to businesses continue to decline. According to the latest survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, small business owners see some improvement in credit availability, but they still have not seen the pickup in sales that would trigger more investment. One area of continued stress is housing. After what looked to be a gradual recovery in new homebuilding during DATE and DATE, new single-family starts slumped again during DATE and remained depressed in DATE. Sales of new and existing homes are still at very low levels, and inventory remains high compared with the DATE pace of sales. House prices - even apart from sales of bank-owned properties - have been falling again, and many households appear to have lost confidence that prices will turn up anytime soon. Disturbing reports of foreclosure improprieties have heightened concerns about mortgage loan servicing and mortgage modifications and have created uncertainty about the pace and volume of foreclosure sales yet to come. Delinquency and default rates on existing mortgages seem to have peaked, but they remain at historically high rates. And while low mortgage interest rates have contributed to strong refinancing activity, many households are still unable to qualify for the loans with the most favorable terms due to depressed home values, reduced income, or weaker credit scores. The commercial real estate market is also still quite anemic. Even after DATE of declining investment in office and commercial structures, vacancy rates are still elevated and property prices remain weak. Financing conditions for commercial real estate remain tight, and delinquency rates deteriorated further during DATE. That said, some modest signs of improvement have surfaced: After having declined for DATE, prices of commercial real estate, although still volatile, have changed little, on net, since DATE, and the number of property sale transactions has increased recently. Also, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has turned up, albeit from a low level. State and local governments also continue to struggle. The federal fiscal stimulus of the past DATE helped shore up this sector, but did not prevent significant cutbacks in services and employment that were associated with the steep decline in revenues sustained during the recession. In DATE, with some pickup in retail spending and moderate gains in taxable income, revenues began to firm and outlays by state and local governments appeared to stabilize. Nonetheless, these jurisdictions will continue to face significant pressures to satisfy balanced budget requirements and to rebuild their depleted reserve funds at the same time that federal stimulus grants are winding down. With the recovery proceeding at a moderate rate and the margin of economic slack quite wide, the underlying rate of inflation has been trending lower despite upward pressure from rising costs of energy and other commodities and rising prices of imported goods. In DATE, overall inflation in PCE prices was NUM percent, and the DATE change in core PCE inflation, which excludes more-volatile food and energy costs, was just NUM percent. Both measures show that inflation has drifted lower over DATE, and that slowing appears to have been broadly based. Indeed, even after reviewing a number of measures of the underlying trend in inflation, I find it difficult to identify a single measure that doesn't show that inflation has drifted steadily lower. At the same time, longerrun inflation expectations still appear to be stable. The economic outlook Although the recovery continues to be uneven across sectors, recent economic and financial developments are broadly consistent with my forecast that the economic recovery will gain even more momentum and that the expansion will become sufficiently strong to gradually bring down the unemployment rate. Key elements of my forecast include further strengthening in consumer spending and business investment in equipment and software, both of which will receive additional support from the recently enacted tax package. Given the currently high level of resource slack and my projection for only a gradual reduction in unemployment, I expect that inflation will remain subdued. My forecast for continued growth in consumer spending is predicated on an assumption of ongoing recovery in wage and salary income that should accompany an expected pickup in hiring. In addition, household balance sheets should gradually strengthen as asset prices firm and continued deleveraging reduces household debt. As the recovery continues, businesses should become more confident about expanding - by both upgrading facilities and adding workers. To date, larger firms have contributed importantly to the recovery in business spending, and they seem well positioned for further investment. Over time, small businesses, which have been held back by the slow recovery in demand and greater difficulties in obtaining credit, should also become more able to increase their spending and expand their operations. Prospects for U.S. trade are generally favorable. Global economic activity rebounded rapidly during the initial stages of the recovery, buoyed by a bounceback in global trade and inventory restocking around the world. Activity abroad has slowed more recently and seems to be settling on a sustainable path that still should result in rising demand for U.S. exports. Barring any significant spillover from the financial turmoil in peripheral European countries, the expansion abroad should continue. In that regard, I should note that renewed concerns about fiscal strains and banking-sector problems in the euro-area periphery have recently contributed to increased volatility in financial markets, but, to date, we have not seen a widespread pullback. My outlook for the housing market and for commercial real estate is more cautious. A sustained recovery in income and jobs will be an important prerequisite for a recovery in the housing industry. But until the overhang of vacant homes is reduced significantly and home values begin to firm, new residential construction is likely to remain at low levels. Similarly, time will be required to absorb the currently large amount of vacant office and commercial space before construction in that sector begins to turn up noticeably. One important element of the outlook is my expectation that financial market functioning and lending conditions will continue to improve, providing additional support for a further pickup in consumer and business spending. During the financial crisis, banks reported on our DATE survey an extraordinary tightening of their lending standards. To date, only a small part of that tightening appears to have been reversed. As banks continue to repair their balance sheets and develop greater confidence in the economic outlook, I anticipate that standards will improve further over DATE. Nonetheless, I expect loan volumes, especially real estate loan volumes, to recover only slowly as both borrowers and lenders proceed cautiously. One notable exception to my forecast for gradual improvement in financial markets is my expectation that residential mortgage markets could take DATE to repair as policymakers and market participants grapple with the role of government in housing finance, adapt to changing regulation, and look for ways to better manage and price the risks associated with mortgage lending and servicing. Whatever the structure of housing finance is to become, the large overhang of problem loans and weak housing markets will necessitate a gradual transition. Based on all of these assumptions, I expect a gradual decline in unemployment DATE and little change in the underlying rate of inflation. Monetary policy The Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with two monetary policy objectives, known as our dual mandate - the achievement of maximum employment and price stability. As I noted earlier, the financial crisis and severe recession left the economy far below levels of resource utilization consistent with maximum sustained employment. And the wide margins of economic slack that have persisted have moved inflation below a level of NUM percent or a bit less, which is the rate that most FOMC participants see as consistent with our dual mandate. In light of these disappointing results, monetary policy continues to be focused on ensuring that the economic recovery is sufficiently strong to sustain noticeable progress toward our mandated objectives. I would like to take TIME to offer some perspectives on how monetary policy has been meeting this challenge. As you know, the Federal Reserve responded forcefully to the financial crisis by employing a range of measures and programs to provide badly needed liquidity to financial institutions and markets. At the same time, the FOMC used both standard and less-conventional forms of monetary policy to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The standard way in which the FOMC stimulates the economy is by reducing the target for the overnight federal funds rate and shaping expectations about future policy actions through the FOMC's statement and other communications. Such policy actions typically lead to lower interest rates and a broader easing of financial conditions that together boost business and household spending and net exports. However, after the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero in DATE NUM, that conventional policy tool was essentially no longer available. To provide additional accommodation, between DATE NUM and DATE, the FOMC elected to purchase large amounts of longer-term Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Those purchases put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates generally and helped normalize the spread between mortgage rates and long-term Treasury rates, which had widened during the financial crisis. Reducing longer-term rates influences the economy in much the same way as lowering the expected path of short-term rates. For instance, the decline in longer-term rates lowers the cost and increases the availability of capital and credit, which in turn encourages business expansion. In the most recent episode, another important result of lower rates has been a reduction in debt service burdens from existing debt. Households in particular have significantly reduced mortgage payments through refinancing. And numerous small business owners have told me that they could not have survived the downturn without low rates. Economic activity picked up in DATE, but by the time the FOMC met in DATE, the rate of growth seemed to be slowing and inflation continued to drift lower. In addition, lower mortgage rates were resulting in faster prepayment of mortgages underlying the agency MBS held by the Federal Reserve. To avoid the modest monetary tightening that would result from the Fed's gradually shrinking portfolio of agency MBS, the FOMC voted to reinvest all principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in longer-term Treasury securities. The Committee also began a discussion about the strength of the recovery, the amount of slack in the economy, the likely path of inflation, and the appropriate action to provide additional monetary accommodation should such action be deemed necessary. In DATE, the FOMC judged that additional monetary policy stimulus was needed to support the economic recovery and help ensure that inflation, over time, returned to desired levels. To implement that stimulus, the Committee decided to expand its holdings of securities by purchasing an additional $NUM billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of DATE. After considering the costs and benefits of the action and recognizing that taking no action would have its own risks, I believe that the expansion of securities holdings was worth implementing to support the economy and make the recovery more durable. I don't want to overpromise. This action is not a panacea. While it is still premature to judge the overall efficacy of the program, I believe that by exerting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, it has provided and will continue to provide support for a vulnerable recovery. At the same time, I believe the risks associated with this action are manageable, that we have the safeguards in place to monitor evolving conditions, and, most importantly, that we have the conviction to act when necessary. Based on our own research and that of others, evidence is accumulating that purchases of longer-term assets have been successful in exerting downward pressure on longer-term rates.NUM Consistent with research on the effects of asset purchases, between DATE, when Chairman Bernanke in a speech first publicly suggested the Federal Reserve might take additional action, and DATE, when the action was taken, longer-term Treasury rates fell as market participants priced in additional Fed purchases.NUM However, since the announcement of the decision to purchase longer-term Treasury securities, longer-term rates have actually increased. It might seem that the recent increase in rates contradicts the view that Fed asset purchases put downward pressure on rates. However, the logic behind this view works in both directions. If the market expects the Fed to respond to weak economic conditions by buying more assets, investors bid up the assets and rates fall. Conversely, if the market expects the economy to strengthen, investors ratchet back expectations for Fed purchases and reduce their bid for the assets, and rates rise. I believe that the current rise in rates is due to exactly this latter circumstance - a strengthening in market participants' outlook for the economy and a corresponding decrease in the market's expectation for future accommodation. One concern that has been raised about asset purchases is the resulting expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and the corresponding increase in reserves. For example, some observers have noted that an increase in reserve balances could lead to an increase in the money supply, which would in turn generate inflation pressures. Others have worried that elevated levels of reserve balances might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to remove NUM See, for example, Diana Hancock and Wayne Passmore (DATE), \"Did the Federal Reserve's MBS Purchase Program Lower Mortgage Rates?\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series DATE-NUM (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, DATE), available at www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/DATE/index.html. Other papers include Stefania D'Amico and Thomas B. King (DATE), \"Flow and Stock Effects of Large-Scale Treasury Purchases,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series DATE-NUM (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, DATE); available at www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/DATE/index.html; Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (DATE), \"Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?\" Staff Report NUM (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, DATE); available at www.ny.frb.org/research/staffreports/sr441.html; and James D. Hamilton and Jing (Cynthia) Wu (DATE), \"The Effectiveness of Alternative Monetary Policy Tools in a Zero Lower Bound Environment,\" working paper (San Diego: University of California, San Diego, DATE (revised DATE)). NUM See Ben S. Bernanke (DATE), \"The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,\" speech delivered at \"Macroeconomic Challenges: The Decade Ahead,\" a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., DATE NUM-NUM. www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernankeDATE0827a.htm. monetary accommodation at the appropriate time. While we will need to remain alert to economic developments, I am convinced that we can and will manage these risks. The monetary policy objective of asset purchases is to foster downward pressure on interest rates. But assets are \"paid for\" by crediting the reserve balances of banks, generating higher levels of reserve balances in the banking system. Reserves are relevant to the growth of the money supply because banks are required to hold a percentage of some types of deposits as reserves with the Federal Reserve. Thus, the total amount of reserves in the banking system acts to cap maximum reservable deposits. It is important to note that it is deposits, not reserve balances, that are included in the monetary aggregates used to measure the money supply. For example, M1 is made up of currency, traveler's checks, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits, while M2 is made up of M1 plus savings, small time deposits, and retail money market mutual funds. Moreover, the linkage between the level of reserve balances and the monetary aggregates in the current environment is quite weak. You were probably taught, as I was, that the broad monetary aggregates increase when reserve balances increase because the larger volume of reserves supports increased lending, which in turn leads to a larger volume of reservable deposits. While that argument might hold in normal circumstances, in the current environment excess reserves are many multiples of required reserves, and adding reserves is unlikely to spark a further increase in the volume of deposits. As a result, the textbook linkage between reserve balances, bank loans, and transaction deposits just is not operative at present. Fundamentally, the levels of M1 and M2 are determined by the strength of the economy and the preferences of businesses and consumers for money, which depend on the yields on monetary instruments and competing assets. Recent experience has again illustrated the difficulty in identifying a reliable relationship between reserve balances and the monetary aggregates. Even though Federal Reserve actions to fight the financial crisis and support the economic recovery added roughly $NUM trillion to a base of about $NUM billion in aggregate bank reserves, M1 and M2 rose at relatively moderate rates over DATE. Going one step further, I should note that the linkage between the monetary aggregates and either real economic activity or inflation has been very weak over DATE. The lack of a reliable relationship between the monetary aggregates and the economy led the Federal Reserve to abandon M1 as a key policy instrument in DATE and then to reduce the role of M2 as a policy instrument in DATE and DATE. Indeed, in a DATE speech about the historic use of monetary aggregates in setting Federal Reserve policy, Chairman Bernanke pointed out that, \"in practice, the difficulty has been that, in the United States, deregulation, financial innovation, and other factors have led to recurrent instability in the relationships between various monetary aggregates and other nominal variables.\"NUM Still, my colleagues and I will be monitoring a wide range of financial and economic developments very closely - including the growth of the money supply, inflation, and many other financial and nonfinancial variables - and, based on a full assessment of those developments, the FOMC will withdraw monetary accommodation at the appropriate time. My view is that the elevated reserve balances would be inflationary only if they prevented the FOMC from effectively removing monetary accommodation by raising interest rates when the time comes to remove such accommodation, and I am convinced that that will not be the case. The FOMC has a number of tools at its disposal for raising interest rates. When appropriate, the Federal Reserve can put upward pressure on interest rates by raising the rate it pays on reserve balances. Moreover, we have developed new tools that will allow us to drain reserves if necessary. In particular, we can drain large volumes of reserves by replacing them with repurchase agreements and term deposits. Finally, we can always sell the securities we purchased. Such sales would not only drain reserves but would also put direct upward pressure on longer-term rates. Conclusion Overall, the recovery in economic activity to date has been uneven and has not been sufficient to reduce unemployment noticeably. But I am encouraged by signs that the recovery may have gained traction recently. And I believe that sustained gains in consumer spending and business investment and a further easing of credit conditions will reinforce each other, leading to greater confidence and improving the prospects for an extended expansion that, over time, will reduce unemployment to a level consistent with full employment. At the same time, I anticipate that inflation will remain subdued. Finally, I believe that the actions taken by the FOMC to support the economic recovery are appropriate, and I am confident in our commitment to monitor economic conditions and take action as needed.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Remarks on Class Day DATE Speech of Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    It seems to me, paradoxically, that both long ago and only yesterday I attended my own Class Day in DATE. I am pleased and honored to be invited back by the students of Harvard. Our speaker in DATE was Dick Gregory, the social critic and comedian, who was inclined toward the sharp-edged and satiric. Central bankers don't do satire as a rule, so I am going to have to strive for \"kind of interesting\". When I attended Class Day as a graduating senior, Gerald Ford was President, and an upand-coming fellow named Alan Greenspan was his chief economic adviser. DATE, the last Americans remaining in Saigon had been evacuated by helicopters. On a happier note, the Red Sox were on their way to winning the American League pennant. I skipped classes to attend a World Series game against the Cincinnati Reds. As was their wont in DATE, the Sox came agonizingly close to a championship but ended up snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. On that score, as on others - disco music and Pet Rocks come to mind - many things are better DATE than they were then. In fact, that will be a theme of my remarks DATE. Although DATE was a pretty good year for the Red Sox, it was not a good one for the U.S. economy. Then as now, we were experiencing a serious oil price shock, sharply rising prices for food and other commodities, and subpar economic growth. But I see the differences between the economy of DATE and the economy of DATE as more telling than the similarities. DATE's situation differs from that of DATE in large part because our economy and society have become much more flexible and able to adapt to difficult situations and new challenges. Economic policymaking has improved as well, I believe, partly because we have learned well some of the hard lessons of the past. Of course, I do not want to minimize the challenges we currently face, and I will come back to a few of these. But I do think that our demonstrated ability to respond constructively and effectively to past economic problems provides a basis for optimism about the future. I will focus my remarks DATE on two economic issues that challenged us in DATE and that still do so DATE - energy and productivity. These, obviously, are not the kind of topics chosen by many recent Class Day speakers - Will Farrell, Ali G, or Seth MacFarlane, to name a few. But, then, the Class Marshals presumably knew what they were getting when they invited an economist. Because the members of DATE's graduating class - and some of your professors - were not yet born in DATE, let me begin by briefly surveying the economic landscape in DATE. The economy had just gone through a severe recession, during which output, income, and employment fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose to NUM percent. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation, which had been around NUM percent to NUM percent DATE, soared to more than NUM percent during my senior year.NUM The oil price shock of DATE began in DATE when, in response to the Yom Kippur War, Arab oil producers imposed an embargo on exports. Before the embargo, in DATE, the price of imported oil was about $NUM per barrel; by DATE, the average price was nearly $NUM per barrel, more than four times greater. President Nixon had imposed economywide controls on wages and prices in DATE, including prices of petroleum products; in DATE, in the wake of the embargo, the President placed additional controls on petroleum prices.NUM As basic economics predicts, when a scarce resource cannot be allocated by marketdetermined prices, it will be allocated some other way - in this case, in what was to become an iconic symbol of the times, by long lines at gasoline stations. In DATE, in an attempt to overcome the unintended consequences of price controls, drivers in many places were permitted to buy gasoline only on odd or even DATE, depending on the last digit of their license plate number. Moreover, with the controlled price of U.S. crude oil well below world prices, growth in domestic exploration slowed and production was curtailed - which, of course, only made things worse. In addition to creating long lines at gasoline stations, the oil price shock exacerbated what was already an intensifying buildup of inflation and inflation expectations. In another echo of DATE, the inflationary situation was further worsened by rapidly rising prices of agricultural products and other commodities. Economists generally agree that monetary policy performed poorly during this period. In part, this was because policymakers, in choosing what they believed to be the appropriate setting for monetary policy, overestimated the productive capacity of the economy. I'll have more to say about this shortly. Federal Reserve policymakers also underestimated both their own contributions to the inflationary problems of the time and their ability to curb that inflation. For example, on occasion they blamed inflation on so-called cost-push factors such as union wage pressures and price increases by large, market-dominating firms; however, the abilities of unions and firms to push through inflationary wage and price increases were symptoms of the problem, not the underlying cause. DATE passed before the Federal Reserve gained a new leadership that better understood the central bank's role in the inflation process and that sustained anti-inflationary monetary policies would actually work. Beginning in DATE, such policies were implemented successfully - although not without significant cost in terms of lost output and employment - under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. For the Federal Reserve, two crucial lessons from this experience were, first, that high inflation can seriously destabilize the economy and, second, that the central bank must take responsibility for achieving price stability over the medium term. Fast-forward now to DATE. In DATE, crude oil cost a little more than $NUM per barrel.NUM Since then, crude oil prices have increased more than fourfold, proportionally about as much as in DATE. Now, as in DATE, adjusting to such high prices for crude oil has been painful. Gas prices around $NUM a gallon are a huge burden for many households, as well as for truckers, manufacturers, farmers, and others. But, in many other ways, the economic consequences have been quite different from those of DATE. One obvious difference is what you don't see: drivers lining up on odd or even DATE to buy gasoline because of price controls or signs at gas stations that say \"No gas.\" And until the recent slowdown - which is more the result of conditions in the residential housing market and in financial markets than of higher oil prices - economic growth was solid and unemployment remained low, unlike what we saw following oil price increases in DATE. For a central banker, a particularly critical difference between then and now is what has happened to inflation and inflation expectations. The overall inflation rate has averaged about NUM-NUM/NUM percent over DATE, significantly higher than we would like but much less than the double-digit rates that inflation reached in DATE and then again in DATE. Moreover, the increase in inflation has been milder this time - on the order of NUM percentage point over DATE as compared with the NUM percentage point jump that followed the DATE oil price shock.NUM From the perspective of monetary policy, just as important as the behavior of actual inflation is what households and businesses expect to happen to inflation in the future, particularly over the longer term. If people expect an increase in inflation to be temporary and do not build it into their longer-term plans for setting wages and prices, then the inflation created by a shock to oil prices will tend to fade relatively quickly. Some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have risen in DATE, which is a significant concern for the Federal Reserve. We will need to monitor that situation closely. However, changes in long-term inflation expectations have been measured in tenths of a percentage point this time around rather than in whole percentage points, as appeared to be the case in DATE. Importantly, we see little indication DATE of the beginnings of a DATE-style wage-price spiral, in which wages and prices chased each other ever upward. A good deal of economic research has looked at the question of why the inflation response to the oil shock has been relatively muted in the current instance.NUM One factor, which illustrates my point about the adaptability and flexibility of the U.S. economy, is the pronounced decline in the energy intensity of the economy since DATE. Since DATE, the energy required to produce a given amount of output in the United States has fallen by about half.NUM This great improvement in energy efficiency was less the result of government programs than of steps taken by households and businesses in response to higher energy prices, including substantial investments in more energy-efficient equipment and means of transportation. This improvement in energy efficiency is one of the reasons why a given increase in crude oil prices does less damage to the U.S. economy DATE than it did in DATE. Another reason is the performance of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have learned the lessons of DATE. Because monetary policy works with a lag, the short-term inflationary effects of a sharp increase in oil prices can generally not be fully offset. However, since Paul Volcker's time, the Federal Reserve has been firmly committed to maintaining a low and stable rate of inflation over the longer term. And we recognize that keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored is essential to achieving the goal of low and stable inflation. Maintaining confidence in the Fed's commitment to price stability remains a top priority as the central bank navigates the current complex situation. Although our economy has thus far dealt with the current oil price shock comparatively well, the United States and the rest of the world still face significant challenges in dealing with the rising global demand for energy, especially if continued demand growth and constrained supplies maintain intense pressure on prices. The silver lining of high energy prices is that they provide a powerful incentive for action - for conservation, including investment in energy-saving technologies; for the investment needed to bring new oil supplies to market; and for the development of alternative conventional and nonconventional energy sources. The government, in addition to the market, can usefully address energy concerns, for example, by supporting basic research and adopting well-designed regulatory policies to promote important social objectives such as protecting the environment. As we saw after the oil price shock of DATE, given some time, the economy can become much more energyefficient even as it continues to grow and living standards improve. Let me turn now to the other economic challenge that I want to highlight DATE - the productivity performance of our economy. At this point you may be saying to yourself, \"Is it too late to book Ali G?\" However, anyone who stayed awake through EC NUM understands why this issue is so important.NUM As Adam Smith pointed out in DATE, in the long run, more than any other factor, the productivity of the workforce determines a nation's standard of living. DATE following DATE World War II were remarkable for their industrial innovation and creativity. From NUM to DATE, TIME of work grew by nearly NUM percent per year, on average.NUM But then, for DATE, productivity growth averaged only about NUM-NUM/NUM percent per year, barely half its previous rate. Predictably, the rate of increase in the standard of living slowed as well, and to about the same extent. The difference between NUM percent and NUM-NUM/NUM percent may sound small. But at NUM percent per year, the standard of living would double DATE, or once every generation; by contrast, at NUM-NUM/NUM percent, a doubling would occur only roughly every NUM years, or once every other generation. Among the many consequences of the productivity slowdown was a further complication for the monetary policy makers of DATE. Detecting shifts in economic trends is difficult in real time, and most economists and policymakers did not fully appreciate the extent of the productivity slowdown until the late DATE. This further influenced the policymakers of the time toward running a monetary policy that was too accommodative. The resulting overheating of the economy probably exacerbated the inflation problem of that decade.NUM Productivity growth revived in DATE, as I mentioned, illustrating once again the resilience of the American economy.NUM Since DATE, productivity has increased at about a NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE rate. A great deal of intellectual effort has been expended in trying to explain the recent performance and to forecast the future evolution of productivity. Much very good work has been conducted here at Harvard by Dale Jorgenson (my senior thesis adviser in DATE, by the way) and his colleagues, and other important research in the area has been done at the Federal Reserve Board.NUM One key finding of that research is that, to have an economic impact, technological innovations must be translated into successful commercial applications. This country's competitive, market-based system, its flexible capital and labor markets, its tradition of entrepreneurship, and its technological strengths - to which Harvard and other universities make a critical contribution - help ensure that that happens on an ongoing basis. While private-sector initiative was the key ingredient in generating the pickup in productivity growth, government policy was constructive, in part through support of basic research but also to a substantial degree by promoting economic competition. Beginning in the late DATE, the federal government deregulated a number of key industries, including air travel, trucking, telecommunications, and energy. The resulting increase in competition promoted cost reductions and innovation, leading in turn to new products and industries. It is difficult to imagine that we would have online retailing DATE if the transportation and telecommunications industries had not been deregulated. In addition, the lowering of trade barriers promoted productivity gains by increasing competition, expanding markets, and increasing the pace of technology transfer.NUM Finally, as a central banker, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the contribution of monetary policy to the improved productivity performance. By damping business cycles and by keeping inflation under control, a sound monetary policy improves the ability of households and firms to plan and increases their willingness to undertake the investments in skills, research, and physical capital needed to support continuing gains in productivity. Just as the productivity slowdown was associated with a slower growth of real per capita income, the productivity resurgence since DATE has been accompanied by a pickup in real income growth. One measure of average living standards, real consumption per capita, is nearly NUM percent higher DATE than in DATE. In addition, the flood of innovation that helped spur the productivity resurgence has created many new job opportunities, and more than a few fortunes. But changing technology has also reduced job opportunities for some others - bank tellers and assembly-line workers, for example. And that is the crux of a whole new set of challenges. Even though average economic well-being has increased considerably over time, the degree of inequality in economic outcomes over DATE has increased as well. Economists continue to grapple with the reasons for this trend. But as best we can tell, the increase in inequality probably is due to a number of factors, notably including technological change that seems to have favored higher-skilled workers more than lower-skilled ones. In addition, some economists point to increased international trade and the declining role of labor unions as other, probably lesser contributing factors. What should we do about rising economic inequality? Answering this question inevitably involves difficult value judgments and tradeoffs. But approaches that inhibit the dynamism of our economy would clearly be a step in the wrong direction. To be sure, new technologies and increased international trade can lead to painful dislocations as some workers lose their jobs or see the demand for their particular skills decline. However, hindering the adoption of new technologies or inhibiting trade flows would do far more harm than good over the longer haul. In the short term, the better approach is to adopt policies that help those who are displaced by economic change. By doing so, we not only provide assistance to those who need it but help to secure public support for the economic flexibility that is essential for prosperity. In the long term, however, the best way by far to improve economic opportunity and to reduce inequality is to increase the educational attainment and skills of American workers. The productivity surge in DATE after World War II corresponded to a period in which educational attainment was increasing rapidly; in DATE, progress on that front has been far slower. Moreover, inequalities in education and in access to education remain high. As we think about improving education and skills, we should also look beyond the traditional K-NUM and DATE-college system - as important as it is - to recognize that education should be lifelong and can come in many forms. Early childhood education, community colleges, vocational schools, on-the-job training, online courses, adult education - all of these are vehicles of demonstrated value in increasing skills and lifetime earning power. The use of a wide range of methods to address the pressing problems of inadequate skills and economic inequality would be entirely consistent with the themes of economic adaptability and flexibility that I have emphasized in my remarks. I will close by shifting from the topic of education in general to your education specifically. Through effort, talent, and doubtless some luck, you have succeeded in acquiring an excellent education. Your education - more precisely, your ability to think critically and creatively - is your greatest asset. And unlike many assets, the more you draw on it, the faster it grows. Put it to good use. The poor forecasting record of economists is legendary, but I will make a forecast in which I am very confident: Whatever you expect your life and work to be like DATE, or DATE, the reality will be quite different. In looking over the 30th anniversary report on my own class, I was struck by the great diversity of vocations and avocations that have engaged my classmates. To be sure, the volume was full of attorneys and physicians and professors as well as architects, engineers, editors, bankers, and even a few economists. Many listed the title \"vice president,\" and, not a few, \"president.\" But the class of DATE also includes those who listed their occupations as composer, environmental advocate, musician, playwright, rabbi, conflict resolution coach, painter, community organizer, and essayist. And even for those of us with the more conventional job descriptions, the nature of our DATE work and its relationship to the economy and society is, I am sure, very different from what we might have guessed in DATE. My point is only that you cannot predict your path. You can only try to be as prepared as possible for the opportunities, as well as the disappointments, that will come your way. For people, as for economies, adaptability and flexibility count for a great deal. Wherever your path leads, I hope you use your considerable talents and energy in endeavors that engage and excite you and benefit not only yourselves, but also in some measure your country and your world. DATE, I wish you and your families a day of joyous celebration. Congratulations.

                  "William C Dudley: A bit better, but very far from best - US economic outlook and the challenges facing the Federal Reserve Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Fordham Corporate Law Center Lecture, New York, NUM DATE.    Thank you for having me here to speak DATE. It is a real pleasure to have this opportunity to discuss the economic outlook and the challenges that face the Federal Reserve in terms of monetary policy going forward. As always, my remarks reflect my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. My assessment of where things stand DATE is mixed. On the positive side, the financial markets are performing better and the economy is now recovering. In fact, the improvement in financial conditions has caused usage of the Fed's special liquidity facilities to fall considerably. Consistent with their design, these facilities have become relatively less attractive as market conditions have improved. Also, the Federal Reserve has begun to taper its rate of asset purchases. The Treasury purchase program will end DATE and the agency MBS purchase program by DATE. On the negative side, the unemployment rate is much too high and it seems likely that the recovery will be less robust than desired. This means that the economy has significant excess slack and implies that we face meaningful downside risks to inflation over DATE or two. Also, there are those who express anxiety about whether the Fed has the tools and the will to raise the federal funds rate when the time is appropriate. I want to assure you that the Fed has the tools to tighten monetary policy regardless the size of its balance sheet. Moreover, we have the will to do so in order to keep inflation in check. Turning first to the developments in financial markets, there is little doubt that we have seen a vast improvement over DATE. The major equity indices have risen sharply, credit spreads have narrowed and bank equity prices have generally shown a substantial recovery. Many large financial and nonfinancial firms have found it relatively easy again to tap the debt and equity markets. The recovery in financial asset prices has been mirrored - albeit with a lag - in the economy. Industrial production has begun to rebound as the pace of inventory liquidation has slowed. Housing prices and activity have recovered somewhat - aided by the improvement in housing affordability and the first-time homebuyer tax credit. Fiscal stimulus is providing support to consumption and to state and local infrastructure spending. The vicious cycle we had DATE - in which the deterioration in financial markets led to economic weakness and that weakness reinforced the tightening of financial conditions - has been broken. In fact, to some extent, it has been replaced with a virtuous cycle. As financial markets have recovered, that has led to an improvement in business and consumer sentiment that, in turn, has helped to lift the economy, spurring further gains in financial asset prices. In the same way that the improvement in market conditions is helping to support a sustainable economic recovery, the fact that the recovery in economic activity is a world-wide phenomenon helps mitigate the risk of a so-called \"double-dip.\" The recovery in foreign demand should help to support the U.S. economy even if U.S. domestic demand grows more slowly than anticipated. Given these developments, the consensus forecast of about NUM percent annualized real GDP growth in DATE appears reasonable. However, I also suspect that the recovery will turn out to be moderate by historical standards. This is a disappointing outcome in that growth will likely not be strong enough to bring the unemployment rate - currently NUM percent - down quickly. I see three major forces restraining the pace of this recovery. First, households are unlikely to have fully adjusted to the net wealth shock that has been generated by the housing price decline and the weakness in share prices. Peak to trough, home prices nationwide have declined by NUM percent measured by the FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Agency) index and by NUM percent according to the NUM-city Case-Shiller index. With respect to stock prices, the S&P NUM index has recovered by more than NUM percent from the trough reached in DATE. But this should be put in context. The S&P NUM index is still about one-third below its recent peak in DATE. Moreover, compared with its level DATE, the S&P NUM index is down by about NUM percent. The shock to household net worth seems likely to have several important implications for household behavior. The shock creates a risk that the household saving rate could increase further. For example, during the period from DATE to NUM, the household saving rate averaged about NUM percent of disposable personal income, considerably higher than the NUM percent average rate during DATE. If the household saving rate were to rise, then consumption would rise more slowly than income, making it more difficult for the economy to develop strong forward momentum. In addition, it seems likely that some workers will respond to the wealth shock by postponing their retirement. This suggests that the labor force participation rate may rise once labor market conditions improve. This would tend to push up the unemployment rate, all else being equal. The second force that could restrain the recovery is the fiscal outlook. The fiscal stimulus that is currently providing support to economic activity is temporary rather than permanent. This has to be the case if we are to ensure that fiscal policy is on a sustainable path over the longrun. This means that the positive impulse from fiscal stimulus will abate over DATE. The third, and perhaps most important factor, is that the banking system has still not fully recovered. Bank credit losses lag the business cycle and are still climbing. Thus, while banks' access to the capital markets has sharply improved, banks are still capital constrained and hesitant to expand their lending. Most importantly, some significant classes of borrowers - namely commercial real estate and small business - are almost wholly dependent on the banking sector for funds, and those funds are not easily forthcoming. The commercial real estate sector is under particular pressure because the fundamentals of the sector have deteriorated sharply and because the sector is highly dependent upon bank lending. In terms of the fundamentals, there are two problems. First, the capitalization rate - the ratio of income to valuation - has climbed sharply. At the peak, capitalization rates for prime properties were in the range of NUM percent. That means that investors were willing to pay $NUM for a $NUM of income. DATE, the capitalization rate appears to have risen to about NUM percent. That means that the same dollar of income is now capitalized as worth only $NUM. In other words, if income were stable, the value of the properties would have fallen by NUM percent. Second, the income generated by commercial real estate has generally been falling. For example, as the recession has pushed up the unemployment rate, the demand for office building space has declined; as the recession has led to a reduction in discretionary travel, hotel occupancy rates and room prices have declined; and as retail sales have weakened, this has reduced the demand for prime retail property space. The decline in commercial real estate valuations has created a significant amount of \"rollover risk\" when commercial real estate loans and mortgages mature and need to be refinanced. The slump in valuations pushes up loan-to-value ratios. This makes lenders wary about extending new credit, even in the case when these loans are performing on a cash flow basis. This means that more pain likely lies ahead for this sector and for those banks with heavy commercial real estate exposures. For small business borrowers, there are three problems. First, the fundamentals of their businesses have often deteriorated because of the length and severity of the recession - making many less creditworthy. Second, some sources of funding for small businesses - credit card borrowing and home equity loans - have dried up as banks have responded to rising credit losses in these areas by tightening credit standards. Third, small businesses have few alternative sources of funds. They are too small to borrow in the capital markets and the Small Business Administration programs are not large enough to accommodate more than a small fraction of the demand from this sector. All of these factors will tend to inhibit the pace of the economic recovery. Given that the recovery is starting with an abnormally large amount of slack, and the pace of recovery is not likely to be robust, this means the economy is likely to have significant excess resources for some time to come. As a result, the balance of risks to inflation lies on the downside, not the upside, at least for DATE or two. To see why this is the case, it is useful to note that inflation dynamics are mainly driven by two factors - the degree of capital and labor resource utilization relative to sustainable levels, and long-run inflation expectations. The degree of resource utilization is essentially driven by the business cycle and, and to some extent, by the Fed's success in achieving the \"maximum sustainable growth\" component of its dual mandate. Inflation expectations, on the other hand, are driven by a combination of actual inflation outcomes and the credibility of the central bank's commitment to price stability. If inflation is low and the central bank is credible, then long-run inflation expectations are likely to remain well anchored. In practice, the relationship between the inflation rate and the level of resource utilization is very difficult to estimate accurately. This stems, in part, from the fact that the data on inflation and resource utilization are \"noisy\" and because sustainable levels of resource utilization are not directly unobservable. The fact is that there is often not much resource slack in the economy also makes it hard to discern a clear empirical relationship. Unfortunately, in this episode, we don't need a precise estimate of slack to be highly confident that the level of slack in the labor market is at or above the record of the post-World War II period. Although the headline unemployment rate of NUM percent is about one percentage point below its level at DATE DATE-NUM recession, other, more indicative measures paint a bleaker picture. For example, the prime age male unemployment rate is at a record high, by a significant margin. The labor market data released DATE showed the DATE value at NUM percent, an increase of NUM percentage points from the start of the recession. In contrast, in the DATE-NUM recession the prime age male unemployment rate peaked at NUM percent, rising by NUM percentage points from the start of that recession. Over the post-World War II period as a whole, it was only in the wake of the DATE-NUM and DATE-NUM recessions that the prime age male unemployment rate remained above NUM percent for more than DATE. In addition, during all post-war expansions, the prime age male unemployment rate has fallen below NUM percent, even during the short expansion of DATE. Currently, even under very optimistic forecasts for the economy, it appears very unlikely that the prime age male unemployment rate will dip below NUM percent before DATE. Alongside the current unusually high degree of labor market slack, we have a situation in which core inflation levels are low by historical standards. Continuing the comparison with the recession of DATE-NUM, it is worth noting that the core inflation rate DATE is almost NUM percentage points lower than it was toward the end of that episode. In addition, historical experience shows that the slack generated during a recession typically pushes core inflation lower in the early stages of recovery. So far, this cycle looks little different. As the degree of slack in the economy has climbed over DATE, measures of core inflation, particularly of core services inflation, have moderated. The tendency for service price movements to be persistent, coupled with the current unusually large amount of slack in the economy, suggests that the core inflation rate is more likely to fall than it is to rise over DATE. In summary, I believe the current balance of risks around the inflation outlook lie to the downside due to the very low level of resource utilization and the fact that long-run inflation expectations remain stable. This balance of risks is problematic because the current level of inflation is already so low - the core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) deflator has increased only NUM percent over DATE. Thus, we would not need much of a decline in inflation to run the risk of an outright deflation. Outright deflation, in turn, would be a dangerous development because it would drive up real debt burdens and make it much more difficult for households and businesses to deleverage. So what are the implications of all this for monetary policy? The first implication is that the federal funds rate target is likely to remain exceptionally low for \"an extended period.\" The desired policy outcome is a robust recovery in the context of price stability. The second implication is that the Federal Reserve needs to ensure that market participants and the public understand that the FOMC has the tools to exit smoothly from the very low federal funds rate, and that it stands ready to do so when the time comes. On this point, let me be perfectly clear: An enlarged balance sheet and the high level of excess reserves in the banking system will not delay or prevent a timely exit. The angst about the Fed's ability to exit smoothly stems from the rapid growth of its balance sheet over DATE. In DATE NUM, on the eve of Lehman Brothers' failure, the consolidated Federal Reserve balance sheet was about $NUM billion. DATE it is about $NUM trillion, and it is likely to peak at around $NUM trillion DATE. Some observers are concerned that this expansion will ultimately prove to be inflationary. Proponents of this view say that the monetary base, the broad monetary aggregates, and total credit outstanding have historically tended to move together with inflation, at least over longer time periods. Thus, if the monetary base is growing rapidly, as it has been over DATE with the growth in the Fed's balance sheet, the argument is that this growth will ultimately lead to inflation. This concern is not well founded because the Federal Reserve now has the ability to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER), and this tool allows us to prevent excess reserves from leading to excessive credit creation. It works as follows. Because the Federal Reserve is the safest of counterparties, the IOER rate effectively becomes the risk-free rate. By raising that rate, the Federal Reserve raises the cost of credit because banks will not lend at rates below the IOER when they can instead hold these excess reserves on deposit with the Fed. Because banks no longer seek to lend out their excess reserves, there is no increase in the amount of credit outstanding, no increase in economic activity and no risk that excessive credit creation will fuel an inflationary spiral. In the event that the ability to pay interest on excess reserves for any reason proved insufficient or the excess reserves themselves had unanticipated side effects that the Fed wished to mitigate, we are developing a number of tools that can be used to drain reserves. Two such tools are large reverse repos with dealers and other investors and term deposit facilities for banks. Finally, the Federal Reserve could always drain reserves the old-fashioned way, by selling assets. The vast bulk of the Fed's portfolio is highly liquid - currently we hold $NUM billion of Treasury securities, $NUM billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, and $NUM billion of agency debt against about $NUM billion of excess reserves. All the excess reserves could be mopped up by asset sales alone if that proved necessary. The Federal Reserve has been very aggressive in responding to the financial crisis. We have rolled out numerous new liquidity facilities and have engaged in lending activity under Section NUM(NUM) of the Federal Reserve Act for the first time since the Great Depression. These actions have been successful in mitigating the risks of financial collapse and a more severe contraction in economic activity. The financial system is now healthier and the economy is recovering. But despite these successes, we need to be clear that what has happened to our financial system and the economy is wholly unsatisfactory, and that a broad range of regulatory policies and practices need to be recalibrated to address the shortcomings of our financial system. With inflation low and long-run inflation expectations stable, and our ability to remove monetary accommodation in a timely manner intact, our near-term focus should be to keep significant monetary accommodation in place for an extended period in order to achieve our dual objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. Thank you for your kind attention. I would be very happy to take a few questions.",

                  "Kevin M Warsh: The Panic of DATE Speech by Mr Kevin M Warsh, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Council of Institutional Investors DATE Spring Meeting, Washington DC, NUM April DATE.    Deterioration in employment conditions. Pullback in consumer spending. Decline of industrial production. Retreat in capacity utilization. Falling capital expenditures. These measures are objective, all-too-familiar indicators of recessions. They emerge during periodic troughs in our economic history. They are thought by most observers to be part of the business cycle. The decennial recessions of DATE, DATE, and DATE were of differing causes and consequences. But they were alike in one key respect: They were extremely disruptive to countless workers, businesses, and communities. In the case of the United States, these periods were endured, and growth resumed apace, matched by new opportunities. The march of growing prosperity, however imperfect and interrupted, continued.NUM Fear. Breakdown in confidence. Market capitulation. Financial turmoil. These words are different, not just in degree but also in kind. They are more normative, but no less consequential to the real economy. They are indicative of panic conditions. In panics, once firmly held truths are no longer relied upon. Articles of faith are upended. And the very foundations of economies and markets are called into question. Some economists, market participants, and historians - not so long ago - were prepared to relegate these highly charged descriptions of despair to the dustbin of history. Government policies improved, understanding of economics deepened, and markets found a more sustainable equilibrium, or so it was thought. The period of DATE is already well chronicled in the popular lexicon as a recession. The recent data are consistent with the view that this recession will endure longer and be deeper and broader than most. Characterizing the current period as a \"recession\" is still wanting, insufficient in some important respects. In my view, this period should equally be considered a panic, one that preceded, if not made more pronounced, the official recession. Hence, the Panic of DATE, which preceded DATE, is a more revealing description of the recent economic and financial travails. As I will describe, panics involve generalized fears - often related to financial firms - that magnify economic weakness. The encouraging news, I should note, is that panics end. And this panic is showing meaningful signs of abating. The storied panics in U.S. economic history were generally marked by widespread bank runs as depositors lost confidence in large segments of the banking system.NUM Such was the case in the Panics of NUM, DATE, DATE, DATE, and DATE. Depositors withdrew funds and hoarded cash, generating increases in currency holdings relative to deposits.NUM This loss of confidence was not limited to individual depositors.NUM During these panics, banks lost confidence in one another. Banks withdrew funds in interbank deposits held at money center banks - then the central repositories for the reserves of the country's banking system. Increased withdrawals of interbank deposits exceeded the money center banks' ability to meet demand, and payments were suspended to other banks. The scramble for funds spilled over into the money markets, where rates on call loans to brokerage houses, considered at the time to be very liquid investments, soared to extreme levels. Sound familiar? This series of events from DATE echoes the events of our time. Panic manifested itself in DATE. Asset-backed commercial paper markets seized up in the United States and abroad. Commercial banks lost confidence in each other, putting pressure on TIME London interbank offered rates. Strains intensified in the spring of DATE when Bear Stearns could not borrow even on a secured basis. And then the panic intensified further in the fall of DATE, as interbank funding markets stopped functioning and TIME rates soared to extraordinary levels. When one money market mutual fund \"broke the buck,\" fears were raised about others. Fund outflows escalated rapidly, threatening the stability of short-term funding to businesses and municipalities. Confidence in money center banks plummeted, as was the case DATE. And market participants lost trust in their counterparties. Extraordinary actions, however, have been taken - with some notable success - to lessen panic conditions. Panics involve losses of confidence in the financial system, when even sound firms find it difficult to borrow. Panics are threatening to economic well-being. Panics take even less kindly to, and often result from, uncertainty. And panics place a greater burden on the deftness of policy responses than recessions alone. Our economic history contains many contractions in output - and losses in wealth - that were unconnected to panics.NUM In the Panic of DATE, however, the breakdown in the financial sector has contributed to, and exacerbated, the economic downturn. Economic and financial conditions The current financial and economic turmoil is marked by indicia of both recession and panic conditions. By official measures, the current recession is already significant in scale, scope, and duration. And the deterioration in employment conditions in the current episode already ranks comparably to the recession of DATE. The unemployment rate is NUM percent and likely, in my view, to increase steadily through the balance of DATE. Economic output, as measured by gross domestic product, contracted at a rate of about NUM-NUM/NUM percent in the fourth quarter of DATE and is on track to contract sharply again in DATE, which would put the current contraction among the most severe post-World War II recessions. Though the pace of decline is likely to abate, I am decidedly uncomfortable forecasting a sharp and determined resumption of growth in DATE. The panic conditions that have marked this period may also have long-run implications. I suspect that the process of an efficient reallocation of capital and labor will prove slower and more difficult than is typical after recessions. Policymakers should be wary of policies that make the economy still less capable of the growth, productivity, and employment trends that have marked the postwar period. In the United States, average stock prices have fallen by NUM percent in DATE and another NUM percent DATE. The average market capitalization of large banking firms plummeted NUM percent in DATE and continued to fluctuate significantly DATE as uncertainty about their earnings prospects, potential balance sheet impairments, and sustainability of business models intensified. Greater clarity as to policymakers' objectives for financial intermediation would likely prove very constructive to financial markets. More consequentially, in my view, it would improve the prospects for economic performance. In the household sector, Federal Reserve data indicate that household net worth fell $NUM trillion in DATE, or about NUM percent, the largest DATE decline recorded.NUM Relative to disposable income, household net worth fell from a ratio of about NUM to one to less than NUM to one, erasing DATE worth of income in wealth. For the median household, net worth is estimated to have decreased at a greater rate - NUM percent in DATE.NUM Household balance sheets may have contracted about another NUM percent in DATE, and I am watching keenly for that trend to change in subsequent quarters as part of the recovery. House price declines accounted for much of the decline in net worth for the median household. But, more than in previous periods, household wealth was harmed by declining share prices through direct equity exposure and retirement plan holdings. Households are thus confronting the risks of income statement shocks through job losses and more significantly correlated changes in the value of virtually all other assets. The heightened concern about these risks is indicated by the extremely high equity risk premiums, which reflect, among other factors, the risk that investors who suffered a loss in income may also be forced to sell their stocks when valuations are low. Traditional rules of income and asset diversification appear to offer scarcer protection than generally advertised. As a result, households are questioning the route to financial security. Homeownership is no longer perceived to ensure low-risk capital appreciation. And assurances by investment managers to invest in \"stocks for the long haul\" are being subjected to intense scrutiny. Investors of all stripes - sovereign wealth funds, large long-only institutional investors, private equity sponsors, hedge funds, and retail investors - are searching for new rules of asset allocation and appropriate risk premiums in an uncertain and unusual economic environment. In a typical recession, the mix of balance sheet contraction by households and businesses and of trends on employment and production would pose meaningful challenges for policymakers. I would argue that the challenge is exacerbated when recessionary dynamics are compounded by panic conditions. Fundamental reassessment Previously, I argued that we were witnessing a fundamental reassessment of the value of every asset everywhere in the world.NUM This diagnosis seems truer, and still more troubling, DATE. The trading of legacy loans and securities continues to reveal systematic underpricing at issuance of once seemingly benign risks - credit, liquidity, counterparty, and even sovereign risks - which are demanding continued reassessment and recalibration. Until these assessments are more cleanly refined and more broadly understood, we are likely to observe elevated levels of volatility and unwillingness by many investors to participate in certain asset markets at virtually any price. The ongoing reassessment of these risks continued through DATE of DATE. Some financial markets and economic actors are still searching for a new equilibrium; others appear to have called off the search teams altogether until the new equilibrium arrives. Since the beginning of DATE, global equity markets have fallen about NUM percent, and the global market capitalization of financial institutions generally underperformed the broader indexes.NUM Few sanctuaries appear to exist from the recession and corresponding global asset revaluation. These real-time economic and financial market indicators surely describe recessionary conditions, a period of significant economic weakness and a global revaluation of asset values. But the depth and severity of this downturn are due, I believe, to a more profound panic phenomenon. Market participants wonder whether the forms of financial intermediation and functions of financial institutions - long connecting savers with investors - will be implemented in a manner that will enhance, or reduce, economic well-being. Some are questioning the efficacy of the remaining vestiges of the existing financial architecture and remain uncertain of the timing, efficacy, and policy preferences for the financial architecture that will ultimately emerge. Surely, they applaud the goal of policymakers to reform the financial system to make it more durable through the cycle and less susceptible to shocks. But some query whether policy actions are, on balance, lessening or stoking panic conditions. Articles of faith Headlines have been dominated in DATE by the legal rules that govern contracts. To be sure, markets function best when economic actors comport themselves in a manner consistent with the rule of law.NUM Fidelity to the rule of law is not just some aphorism for a judicial system to protect property right disputes among private parties. Nor should it be just some preachy truism of economic development for emerging economies. Rather, it is the linchpin of modern market economies like ours. And it suffers its greatest blow when the governing authorities are unwilling to uphold their end of the bargain. Nonetheless, despite some highly publicized suggestions to the contrary, I remain highly confident that the government will work tirelessly to uphold its obligations. Hewing to the rule of law, however, may be the easier part. The panic bred by the loss of confidence in the underlying financial architecture is difficult to remedy beyond the purview of statutes and regulations. A weighty accumulation of unwritten, but no less critical, practices and understandings governs behavior and establishes expectations in market economies. Over time, these informal understandings attract deep and loyal followings by economic actors. They become articles of faith. Deviations from them tend not to be illegal, but they can markedly change perceptions of risk and return. When that happens, the resulting expectations are unmoored, with significant and often highly detrimental consequences for market functioning and economic progress. Panics can thus be understood as periods in which key articles of faith are cast in doubt. How does this happen? After long periods of economic prosperity - in the most recent case, the so-called Great Moderation - articles of faith accumulate. Some of these understandings are strong and enduring and well grounded; others, more problematic or misplaced; others still, properly and promptly discarded. Some of these articles of faith are rooted in government policies; others develop as a matter of private practice. Regardless of their cause and contour, when faith is undermined, the resulting fear and ambiguity can accelerate the deterioration in economic performance. Some key articles of faith have been undermined with respect to some financial institutions. And that is as it should be. Risk-management failures at some large, systemically significant financial institutions are now legendary. In some cases, investors and counterparties came to rely to their detriment on these entities and their financial wherewithal. As wholesale funding markets became tougher to navigate, many financial institutions suffered, some rightly so. But their stronger peers with significantly more robust risk-management practices also appear to be paying a heavy price. It is difficult for the strong to thrive, let alone survive, when they reside in a neighborhood that is being decimated. And when panic conditions persist and long-held articles of faith lose their following, markets often react indiscriminately. Government policies, in my view, should encourage differentiation among firms, even those in seemingly close proximity. For policymakers to act otherwise is to risk their own credibility and risk undermining the pace of economic recovery. Market participants appear equally uncertain about the nature, objective, and duration of the relationship between the government and financial institutions. Given the choices available to policymakers during DATE, some uncertainty is unavoidable. Consider the saga of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). In my judgment, the story of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exposes perhaps the most consequential negative shock to the financial system during this period. For about a generation, the GSEs issued debt that was thought by virtually all market participants to be backed de facto by the U.S. government. The GSEs traveled the world, selling debt at rates and terms and funding schedules that were largely comparable to Treasury securities. Some loud protestations aside, government policy - broadly defined - tended to countenance investor expectations. At DATE DATE, the outstanding public debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac totaled about $NUM trillion, roughly comparable with the publicly held Treasury debt of $NUM trillion, and spreads to Treasuries on their senior debt amounted to about NUM to NUM basis points, even though the institutions were thinly capitalized relative to their asset composition and risk characteristics. In the fall of DATE, however, GSE senior debt spreads widened significantly to more than NUM basis points. Market participants grew increasingly skeptical of the GSEs' financial and operational wherewithal and were uncertain of the depth of government support. When markets decided to test policymakers, as markets are especially wont to do during panics, the Treasury was forced to intercede, effectively taking control of the entities. Congress authorized successive Administrations to take forceful actions, including appropriations of up to $NUM billion to-date, to assure investors and counterparties that the institutions would remain solvent. These efforts, while necessary and well intended, have not completely resolved the uncertainty around the GSEs to market participants. Indeed, even after extraordinary actions most recently by the Federal Reserve to improve liquidity and market functioning in the agency debt markets, confidence in the GSEs is less than markets were long accustomed to before this period began. When presumptively risk-free, highly liquid assets backed by the highest-grade sovereign are subject to large swings in value, the risk-return profile of virtually all other assets becomes highly uncertain. The resulting portfolio reallocation boosts demand for Treasury securities, and reduces demand for assets that are genuinely riskier, placing upward pressure on risk premiums across a wide range of markets. In addition, financial firms that had assumed that their holdings of GSE debt were as good as cash were forced to reassess the adequacy of their liquidity positions, adding to balance sheet pressures and leading to even greater safehaven demands for Treasury securities. Across a broad range of financial institutions and financial markets, an unhealthy mix of recession dynamics and panic conditions appear at work. But, in my view, it is predominantly the latter - the uncertainty with respect to financial intermediation and the corresponding breach of articles of faith - that have exacerbated the downturn. Conclusion Let me offer several concluding observations that may help frame a new foundation for growth and ensure that discarded articles of faith are repaired, reformed, or replaced. The Panic began before the recession and will assuredly end before it. Getting the financial intermediation process to function with greater efficacy - even before a new financial architecture is firmly established - is a necessary condition to a sustained recovery. The Panic is the result of both faulty private practices and flawed public policies. To place blame either exclusively on private financial firms or chiefly at the doorstep of the official sector is incorrect. Financial stability demands policy stability. The official sector's policy preferences must be communicated clearly, credibly, and consistently and backed by concrete action. To accelerate the formation of a new financial architecture, the official sector should outline and defend a positive vision for financial firms and welcome private capital's return. The nature and terms of the relationship between financial firms and the official sector should not be left in limbo. Finally, and perhaps most important, policymakers across the government must be ever mindful of the long-term consequences of their actions. Fluctuations in economic output and employment are unavoidable. As a result, policymakers' objective should be more humble: Maximize sustainable economic growth while reducing the incidence, severity, and economic fallout of future shocks. And we must ensure that the long-heralded strengths of the U.S. economy - the resiliency and dynamism in our labor markets, product markets, and, yes, our financial markets - are allowed to flourish. In so doing, trust will continue to displace panic in our markets, and our economy will ultimately rebound with great vigor and even greater promise.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: SemiDATE Monetary Policy Report to the Congress Testimony of Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, DATE.    Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. As you know, this occasion marks DATE testimony on the economy and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. In establishing these hearings, the Congress proved prescient in anticipating the worldwide trend toward greater transparency and accountability of central banks in the making of monetary policy. Over DATE, these testimonies and the associated reports have proved an invaluable vehicle for the Federal Reserve's communication with the public about monetary policy, even as they have served to enhance the Federal Reserve's accountability for achieving the dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability set for it by the Congress. I take this opportunity to reiterate the Federal Reserve's strong support of the dual mandate; in pursuing maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy makes its greatest possible contribution to the general economic welfare. Let me now review the current economic situation and the outlook, beginning with developments in the real economy and the situation regarding inflation before turning to monetary policy. I will conclude with comments on issues related to lending to households and consumer protection-topics not normally addressed in monetary policy testimony but, in light of recent developments, deserving of our attention DATE. After having run at an above-trend rate earlier in the current economic recovery, U.S. economic growth has proceeded during DATE at a pace more consistent with sustainable expansion. Despite the downshift in growth, the demand for labor has remained solid, with more than NUM,NUM jobs having been added to payrolls thus far in DATE and the unemployment rate having remained at NUM-NUM/NUM percent. The combination of moderate gains in output and solid advances in employment implies that recent increases in labor productivity have been modest by the standards of DATE. The cooling of productivity growth in DATE is likely the result of cyclical or other temporary factors, but the underlying pace of productivity gains may also have slowed somewhat. To a considerable degree, the slower pace of economic growth in DATE reflects the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. Over DATE, home sales and construction have slowed substantially and house prices have decelerated. Although a leveling-off of home sales in DATE suggested some tentative stabilization of housing demand, sales have softened further DATE, leading the number of unsold new homes in builders' inventories to rise further relative to the pace of new home sales. Accordingly, construction of new homes has sunk further, with starts of new single-family houses thus far DATE running NUM percent below the pace in DATE. The pace of home sales seems likely to remain sluggish for a time, partly as a result of some tightening in lending standards and the recent increase in mortgage interest rates. Sales should ultimately be supported by growth in income and employment as well as by mortgage rates that - despite the recent increase - remain fairly low relative to historical norms. However, even if demand stabilizes as we expect, the pace of construction will probably fall somewhat further as builders work down stocks of unsold new homes. Thus, declines in residential construction will likely continue to weigh on economic growth over DATE, although the magnitude of the drag on growth should diminish over time. Real consumption expenditures appear to have slowed DATE, following DATE of rapid expansion. Consumption outlays are likely to continue growing at a moderate pace, aided by a strong labor market. Employment should continue to expand, though possibly at a somewhat slower pace than in DATE as a result of the recent moderation in the growth of output and ongoing demographic shifts that are expected to lead to a gradual decline in labor force participation. Real compensation appears to have risen over DATE, and barring further sharp increases in consumer energy costs, it should rise further as labor demand remains strong and productivity increases. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software showed a modest gain in DATE. A similar outcome is likely for DATE, as weakness in the volatile transportation equipment category appears to have been offset by solid gains in other categories. Investment in nonresidential structures, after slowing sharply DATE, seems to have grown fairly vigorously in the first half of DATE. Like consumption spending, business fixed investment overall seems poised to rise at a moderate pace, bolstered by gains in sales and generally favorable financial conditions. DATE and early DATE, motor vehicle manufacturers and firms in several other industries found themselves with elevated inventories, which led them to reduce production to better align inventories with sales. Excess inventories now appear to have been substantially eliminated and should not prove a further restraint on growth. The global economy continues to be strong. Supported by solid economic growth abroad, U.S. exports should expand further in DATE. Nonetheless, our trade deficit - which was about NUM-NUM/NUM percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in DATE - is likely to remain high. For the most part, financial markets have remained supportive of economic growth. However, conditions in the subprime mortgage sector have deteriorated significantly, reflecting mounting delinquency rates on adjustable-rate loans. In DATE, we have also seen increased concerns among investors about credit risk on some other types of financial instruments. Credit spreads on lower-quality corporate debt have widened somewhat, and terms for some leveraged business loans have tightened. Even after their recent rise, however, credit spreads remain near the low end of their historical ranges, and financing activity in the bond and business loan markets has remained fairly brisk. Overall, the U.S. economy appears likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of DATE, with growth then strengthening a bit in DATE to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend. Such an assessment was made around the time of the DATE meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in deliberations on monetary policy. The central tendency of the growth forecasts, which are conditioned on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, is for real GDP to expand roughly NUM-NUM/NUM to NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE and NUM-NUM/NUM to NUM-NUM/NUM percent in DATE. The forecasted performance for DATE is about NUM/NUM percentage point below that projected in DATE, the difference being largely the result of weaker-than-expected residential construction activity DATE. The unemployment rate is anticipated to edge up to between NUM-NUM/NUM and NUM-NUM/NUM percent over the balance of DATE and about NUM-NUM/NUM percent in DATE, a trajectory about the same as the one expected in DATE. I turn now to the inflation situation. Sizable increases in food and energy prices have boosted overall inflation and eroded real incomes in DATE - both unwelcome developments. As measured by changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), inflation ran at an DATE rate of NUM percent over the first five months of DATE, a rate that, if maintained, would clearly be inconsistent with the objective of price stability.NUM Because monetary policy works with a lag, however, policymakers must focus on the economic outlook. Food and energy prices tend to be quite volatile, so that, looking forward, core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) may be a better gauge than overall inflation of underlying inflation trends. Core inflation has moderated slightly over DATE, with core PCE inflation coming in at an DATE rate of about NUM percent so far DATE. Although the most recent readings on core inflation have been favorable, DATE movements in inflation are subject to considerable noise, and some of the recent improvement could also be the result of transitory influences. However, with long-term inflation expectations contained, futures prices suggesting that investors expect energy and other commodity prices to flatten out, and pressures in both labor and product markets likely to ease modestly, core inflation should edge a bit lower, on net, over the remainder of DATE and DATE. The central tendency of FOMC participants' forecasts for core PCE inflation - NUM to NUM-NUM/NUM percent for DATE and NUM-NUM/NUM to NUM percent in DATE - is unchanged from DATE. If energy prices level off as currently anticipated, overall inflation should slow to a pace close to that of core inflation in DATE. At each of its four meetings so far DATE, the FOMC maintained its target for the federal funds rate at NUM-NUM/NUM percent, judging that the existing stance of policy was likely to be consistent with growth running near trend and inflation staying on a moderating path. As always, in determining the appropriate stance of policy, we will be alert to the possibility that the economy is not evolving in the way we currently judge to be the most likely. One risk to the outlook is that the ongoing housing correction might prove larger than anticipated, with possible spillovers onto consumer spending. Alternatively, consumer spending, which has advanced relatively vigorously, on balance, in DATE, might expand more quickly than expected; in that case, economic growth could rebound to a pace above its trend. With the level of resource utilization already elevated, the resulting pressures in labor and product markets could lead to increased inflation over time. Yet another risk is that energy and commodity prices could continue to rise sharply, leading to further increases in headline inflation and, if those costs passed through to the prices of non-energy goods and services, to higher core inflation as well. Moreover, if inflation were to move higher for an extended period and that increase became embedded in longer-term inflation expectations, the reestablishment of price stability would become more difficult and costly to achieve. With the level of resource utilization relatively high and with a sustained moderation in inflation pressures yet to be convincingly demonstrated, the FOMC has consistently stated that upside risks to inflation are its predominant policy concern.    In addition to its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve has an important responsibility to help protect consumers in financial services transactions. For DATE, the Federal Reserve has been active in implementing, interpreting, and enforcing consumer protection laws. I would like to discuss with you TIME some of our recent initiatives and actions, particularly those related to subprime mortgage lending. Promoting access to credit and to homeownership are important objectives, and responsible subprime mortgage lending can help advance both goals. In designing regulations, policymakers should seek to preserve those benefits. That said, the recent rapid expansion of the subprime market was clearly accompanied by deterioration in underwriting standards and, in some cases, by abusive lending practices and outright fraud. In addition, some households took on mortgage obligations they could not meet, perhaps in some cases because they did not fully understand the terms. Financial losses have subsequently induced lenders to tighten their underwriting standards. Nevertheless, rising delinquencies and foreclosures are creating personal, economic, and social distress for many homeowners and communities - problems that likely will get worse before they get better. The Federal Reserve is responding to these difficulties at both the national and the local levels. In coordination with the other federal supervisory agencies, we are encouraging the financial industry to work with borrowers to arrange prudent loan modifications to avoid unnecessary foreclosures. Federal Reserve Banks around the country are cooperating with community and industry groups that work directly with borrowers having trouble meeting their mortgage obligations. We continue to work with organizations that provide counseling about mortgage products to current and potential homeowners. We are also meeting with market participants - including lenders, investors, servicers, and community groups - to discuss their concerns and to gain information about market developments. We are conducting a top-to-bottom review of possible actions we might take to help prevent recurrence of these problems. First, we are committed to providing more-effective disclosures to help consumers defend against improper lending. DATE, the Board began a comprehensive review of Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The initial focus of our review was on disclosures related to credit cards and other revolving credit accounts. After conducting extensive consumer testing, we issued a proposal in DATE that would require credit card issuers to provide clearer and easier-to-understand disclosures to customers. In particular, the new disclosures would highlight applicable rates and fees, particularly penalties that might be imposed. The proposed rules would also require card issuers to provide DATE advance notice of a rate increase or any other change in account terms so that consumers will not be surprised by unexpected charges and will have time to explore alternatives. We are now engaged in a similar review of the TILA rules for mortgage loans. We began this review DATE by holding four public hearings across the country, during which we gathered information on the adequacy of disclosures for mortgages, particularly for nontraditional and adjustable-rate products. As we did with credit card lending, we will conduct extensive consumer testing of proposed disclosures. Because the process of designing and testing disclosures involves many trial runs, especially given DATE's diverse and sometimes complex credit products, it may take some time to complete our review and propose new disclosures. However, some other actions can be implemented more quickly. By DATE, we will propose changes to TILA rules to address concerns about mortgage loan advertisements and solicitations that may be incomplete or misleading and to require lenders to provide mortgage disclosures more quickly so that consumers can get the information they need when it is most useful to them. We already have improved a disclosure that creditors must provide to every applicant for an adjustable-rate mortgage product to explain better the features and risks of these products, such as \"payment shock\" and rising loan balances. We are certainly aware, however, that disclosure alone may not be sufficient to protect consumers. Accordingly, we plan to exercise our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) to address specific practices that are unfair or deceptive. We held a public hearing on DATE NUM to discuss industry practices, including those pertaining to pre-payment penalties, the use of escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated-income and low-documentation lending, and the evaluation of a borrower's ability to repay. The discussion and ideas we heard were extremely useful, and we look forward to receiving additional public comments in DATE. Based on the information we are gathering, I expect that the Board will propose additional rules under HOEPA later DATE. In coordination with the other federal supervisory agencies, DATE we issued principlesbased guidance on nontraditional mortgages, and in DATE of DATE we issued supervisory guidance on subprime lending. These statements emphasize the fundamental consumer protection principles of sound underwriting and effective disclosures. In addition, we reviewed our policies related to the examination of nonbank subsidiaries of bank and financial holding companies for compliance with consumer protection laws and guidance. As a result of that review and following discussions with the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and state regulators, as represented by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, we are launching a cooperative pilot project aimed at expanding consumer protection compliance reviews at selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime mortgage operations. The reviews will begin in the fourth quarter of DATE and will include independent statelicensed mortgage lenders, nondepository mortgage lending subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with or serving as agents of these entities. The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of and improved enforcement for nondepository mortgage lenders. Working together to address jurisdictional issues and to improve information-sharing among agencies, we will seek to prevent abusive and fraudulent lending while ensuring that consumers retain access to beneficial credit. I believe that the actions I have described DATE will help address the current problems. The Federal Reserve looks forward to working with the Congress on these important issues.",

                  "Edward M Gramlich: Budget and trade deficits - linked, both worrisome in the long run, but not twins Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics Luncheon, Los Angeles, DATE. Presented at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress, London, England, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak DATE. While I know that most of you would welcome any insights I might have about current U.S. monetary policy - whether the Open Market Committee will be raising or lowering interest rates at our next meeting - I prefer to focus instead on some issues that could become serious over the longer run. These issues involve the persistent budget and trade deficits facing the American economy, issues that could eventually involve significant economic adjustments around the world.NUM Large budget and trade deficits are not a new phenomenon. They also arose in the United States in DATE. At that time, the business press and many economists began referring to the situation as one of \"twin deficits.\" With the current re-emergence of both deficits, the phrase has come back into common usage - too common, in my view. To be sure, in theoretical models there is a scenario by which budget deficits can create trade deficits, and one by which trade deficits can create budget deficits. But there are also many scenarios by which either deficit can arise independently, or even by which budget and trade deficits can move in opposite directions, as they did in DATE. In general, while budget and trade deficits can be linked, there are important differences between the two, both in how they respond to economic forces and in their long-run consequences. I start by examining the relationship between budget and trade deficits - why they are linked but not twins. I discuss the sustainability conditions for budget and trade deficits; the conditions that must be fulfilled for the debts on both accounts to be stabilized in relation to the size of the U.S. economy. Then I discuss what happens if either debt violates this condition and rises in relation to the size of the economy. This discussion, in turn, raises further interesting distinctions between the two deficits. The link The link between budget and trade deficits can be seen most naturally through the national income accounting framework. Any saving the nation does finances either private domestic investment directly or the accumulation of claims on foreigners. This means that national saving - the sum of private and government saving - equals private domestic investment plus that period's accumulation of claims on foreigners, or the trade surplus. The trade surplus can also be thought of as net foreign lending. All of these relationships are accounting identities - true at every moment in time apart from data inconsistencies captured by a statistical discrepancy. In equation form, we have (NUM) NS = S - BD = I - TD On the left side of the equation NS refers to national saving, S refers to overall private saving, and BD refers to the government budget deficit. This part of the equation says merely that total national saving equals the sum of all saving done in the economy by the private sector and the government sector. A budget surplus would be treated as governmental saving and added to private saving; a budget deficit would be treated as governmental dissaving and subtracted. The right side of the equation repeats the familiar open economy identity that national saving equals private domestic investment, I, plus the accumulation of claims on foreigners or less that domestic investment financed by foreigners. As was noted earlier, borrowing from foreigners involves either a reduction of claims on them or an increase of claims on us by them. It is by definition equal to the trade deficit TD. In the equation, then, a trade surplus means that some national saving goes to building up claims on foreigners (national saving is greater than domestic investment) while a trade deficit means that some investment is financed by foreigners (national saving is less than domestic investment). This identity first demonstrates the all-important role of national saving in shaping long-run economic welfare. National saving is the only way a country can have its capital and own it too. Models of the economic growth process identify national saving as one of the key policy variables in influencing a nation's living standards in the long run. The identity also makes clear that the budget deficit and the trade deficit can move together on a dollar-per-dollar basis, but only if the difference between private domestic investment and private saving is constant. Typically that difference will not be constant. For example, if there were to be an investment boom, interest rates might rise to induce some new private saving and some new lending by foreigners. The implied trade deficit might rise and, because of the rise in income, the budget deficit might fall. In this case, the trade deficit would increase while the budget deficit fell. Conversely, suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits. If this expansion were totally financed by borrowing from foreigners, domestic interest rates would not change much, and domestic investment and private saving might not either. In this scenario, there could be a simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change in budget and trade deficits - the classic twin-deficit scenario. Such a situation is most likely to occur in small economies fully open to international trade and capital flows, economies in which domestic interest rates are determined by world capital markets and are independent of domestic economic variables. But if domestic interest rates do change, as they likely would in either a closed economy or a large open economy, private investment and saving would also likely change, and any strict link between budget and trade deficits would be broken. One could spin any number of scenarios, but these are enough to make the basic point. Because of the underlying relationship between saving and investment, budget and trade deficits could be strictly linked. But in a large open economy like the United States, it is easy to imagine plenty of scenarios in which they are imperfectly linked, and even some scenarios in which they move in opposite directions. Budget and trade deficits should be viewed as linked, but not as twins. Stability conditions Although the economic implications and reactions of budget deficits and trade deficits differ, both are deficits. Another elementary accounting identity says that last period's debt level plus the current deficit equals the current period's debt level. This identity is true whether we are talking about budget deficits building up the stock of outstanding government debt (a liability of the government sector to the private sector), or trade deficits building up the stock of external debt (the net stock of accumulated foreign claims against the United States).NUM Economists have worried for DATE about optimal stocks of government and external debt. For government debt, the optimal stock turns out to be related to the optimal level of national saving, which can be defined as the level that maximizes the nation's long-term path of consumption per worker. The optimal stock of net external debt can be determined in the same framework from an open economy perspective. While these models can be instructive, DATE I am going to focus on a weaker standard. Whatever the long-term optimal level of government debt, and whatever the optimal level of external debt, one can separately ask whether either debt level is becoming a more, or less, important economic factor over time. For government debt, this weaker standard, or stability condition, determines merely whether the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is stable. If it is, interest payments on the debt will, in equilibrium, also settle down to a stable proportion of GDP. For external debt, a stable debt-to-GDP ratio means that the net interest and dividend payments of the United States to foreign investors will also settle down to a constant ratio to GDP. The appendix derives this stability condition generically. It is that d (NUM) (g - i)/(DATE g) = p, where d is the stable ratio of debt to GDP, g is the nominal growth rate of the economy, i is the nominal interest rate in the economy, and p is the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP. For budget accounts, the primary deficit is the national income accounts budget deficit, but excluding interest payments. For trade accounts, the primary trade deficit is the current account deficit, excluding net interest and dividend payments to foreigners.NUM As a general rule, the economy's growth rate and interest rate will be fairly close. The equation says that if they are equal, the primary deficit must be zero to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. If the interest rate is slightly above the growth rate, as it would be in models without risk for economies that save less than the theoretical optimum, a nation with outstanding debt would have to run a slight primary surplus to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio. If the effective interest rate on debt is slightly below the growth rate, as it has generally been found to be in the past for both deficits, a nation with outstanding debt could run slight primary deficits and not see the debt ratio grow.NUM On the foreign side, this condition has until now been especially forgiving. Even with a large net debt position, our net investment income from foreigners has exceeded that paid out to foreigners. Since the net interest rate has been less than the GDP growth rate, the ratio of external debt to GDP could have been stabilized with a moderate primary trade deficit.NUM Magnitudes It is well known that the U.S. economy now suffers both budget and trade deficits. But how do these deficits compare with the stability conditions? Historically, there have not been significant instabilities in U.S. federal budget deficits.NUM Overall deficits have averaged about NUM percent of GDP over DATE, but figure NUM shows that when interest is deducted, primary budget deficits have averaged close to zero, the approximate level that stabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio. Hence, the outstanding debt, while fluctuating in the range of NUM percent to NUM percent of GDP, has actually declined slightly as a share of GDP. It was NUM percent of GDP in DATE and is now only NUM percent of GDP. The ratio did rise as high as NUM percent in the high-deficit DATE of DATE, but it dropped sharply thereafter with the primary budget surpluses of DATE. Looking ahead, things might not be so favorable. As a result of recent fiscal changes, the budget has lately fallen into primary deficit again; this primary deficit is now more than NUM percent of GDP (NUM percent after cyclical adjustment). The deterioration reflects the much-discussed recent rapid growth in expenditures, along with significant tax cuts. Perhaps more significant, in a few DATE the United States will face huge looming costs for retirement and health programs. It will take extraordinary fiscal discipline just to keep the present primary deficit near its current level of NUM to NUM percent of GDP over the short, medium, and long run. And even at that level, the stability condition is violated by at least NUM percent of GDP, suggesting that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to climb steadily upward.NUM NUM This primary trade deficit differs from the trade deficit component of GDP mentioned earlier because it includes foreign transfers and other small items. NUM Laurence Ball, Douglas W. Elmendorf, and N. Gregory Mankiw, \"The Deficit Gamble,\" Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, vol. NUM, no. NUM, (DATE), pp. NUM-NUM, show that interest rates on domestic government debt have generally been slightly less than the GDP growth rate in DATE. NUM The rate-of-return puzzle is in turn a question about why foreign direct investment in the United States has such a low rate of return. See Raymond J. Mataloni, Jr., \"An Examination of the Low Rates of Return of Foreign-Owned U.S. Companies,\" Survey of Current Business, vol. DATE (DATE), pp. DATE. NUM Even though the previous identity referred to the consumption budget for the entire government sector, in this section I switch over to the familiar concept of the total budget for the U.S. federal government. State and local governments more or less finance their current spending and do not have much outstanding debt apart from that backed by capital formation; and federal capital investment is very small. NUM These statements are based on estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook, DATE NUM (DATE). A further discussion of the long-run budget outlook can be found in Alan J. Auerbach, BIS Review NUM/NUM On the trade side, figure NUM shows that the trend is definitely more worrisome. While the budget debt has fluctuated between NUM percent and NUM percent of GDP over DATE, the net external debt has grown steadily. Until DATE, this external debt was not even positive; that is, until that time the United States had net claims on foreigners. But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since DATE, the net external debt is now NUM percent of GDP and rising sharply. The primary trade deficit is now NUM percent of GDP, violating the stability condition by nearly this same amount. At this rate, the external debt ratio will climb very quickly. While the trade deficit does have equilibrating tendencies, as will be discussed later, there are also forces that tend to increase it. Econometric studies of the basic demand for imports and exports find that the U.S. income elasticity of demand for imports is higher than the foreign income elasticity of demand for U.S. exports. This means that even if the world economy grows at the same rate as the U.S. economy, our trade deficit is likely to widen, (apart from any changes in relative prices).NUM Indeed, the U.S. primary trade deficit has widened steadily since DATE. Adjustments I have just argued that the U.S. is now in violation of the stability condition for both budget and trade deficits - recently and moderately on the budget side, persistently and significantly on the trade side. What are the implications? With each deficit there is probably a credibility range. By that, I mean a limited range within which a country may be able to violate its stability condition and have its debt-to-GDP ratio trend upward without further economic consequences. For budgets, there may be a range within which the debt-to-GDP ratio can grow without significant changes in interest rates.NUM As equation NUM indicates, economic performance in this range is by no means optimal, because the persistent deficits are subtracting funds that would otherwise be devoted to capital investment and future growth in living standards. But there may not be significant relative price effects. The same is true on the trade side; there could be a range in which foreign claims on the United States just build up without major impact on relative prices. Once the economy gets outside of the credibility range, more significant relative price adjustments become likely. On the trade side, for example, the continued accumulation of foreign claims on the U.S. economy will raise the issue of whether foreign investors will want to hold an ever-increasing share of their wealth in the form of U.S. assets. Or, as is the focus of the stability condition above, whether the U.S. economy can indefinitely pay out ever-higher shares of GDP in the form of interest and dividend payments. The conventional view is that at some point there should be a relative price adjustment - some combination of rising U.S. interest rates (to make U.S. assets more attractive), rising foreign prices (to make imports more expensive), moderating U.S. prices (to make U.S. exports more competitive), or a change in exchange rates. Each of these reactions is likely to occur naturally, and each moves in the direction of lowering the external imbalance. That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting. The main risk here is that the natural adjustments may not occur gradually, but so rapidly as to threaten various types of dislocations. There are complicating factors. One involves the currency denomination of the net debt. Countries with large trade deficits often have their external liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Hence, when their own currency depreciates, the value and burden of foreign debt automatically increases. The United States does not have this problem because most of its debt is denominated in dollars - say, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills. If the dollar were to fall, the value of our debt in terms of foreign currencies would then automatically decline, inducing foreign wealth-holders to make further portfolio shifts, perhaps even including increasing their stock of dollar-denominated debt. This denomination effect would not permanently prevent any relative price adjustment, but it could lengthen the process. Beyond that, for pragmatic reasons this conventional adjustment process could be extended or distorted even further. By way of illustration, Asian central banks have now accumulated more than a trillion dollars of international currency reserves - largely in dollar-denominated assets - equal to roughly half of the outstanding net debt of the United States. These central banks are not traditional wealth-holders motivated by expected risks and returns. Instead, they seem motivated more by the prospect of preserving low domestic currency values for their exporters.NUM To pursue this objective, they can print money to buy U.S. securities. This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities - and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible. But if these central banks continue behaving this way, the so-called credibility range could be extended significantly. While trade deficits should ultimately correct themselves, perhaps after a long trek through the credibility range, there are really no natural self-corrective mechanisms for budget deficits. Once the U.S. economy gets through the credibility range, interest rates on the increasing government debt will have to rise to induce people to hold the debt. This rise increases the interest burden and causes total deficits to rise further, all the time subtracting more and more funds from capital accumulation. Once this process begins, market psychology may hasten the adjustment.NUM Hence, while natural forces lessen the basic external imbalance, they increase the basic budget imbalance. In the long run, the only way to correct budget deficits is for policymakers to correct them. Outside forces There are several outside forces - both natural and as a result of policy - that could influence budget and trade deficits. One generally helpful influence is productivity growth. Say the U.S. economy benefits from an exogenous positive shock to productivity growth, as it seemed to have in DATE. This shock would raise the trend path of income, meaning that slightly higher primary budget and trade deficits could still be consistent with debt-to-GDP stability; in effect, a higher level of g can be plugged into equation NUM (at least as long as it is not offset by a higher i). Higher productivity could also help lengthen the credibility range, the range in which moderate changes in the debt ratio might not lead to adverse changes in relative prices. Among other things, higher productivity could raise the marginal product of capital and make investment in U.S. assets relatively attractive. But even with these favorable developments, the stability conditions discussed above still hold. If they are violated, the natural adjustment mechanisms will eventually take over for the trade deficit, and the primary budget deficit will eventually have to be reduced to stop a growing government debt ratio. One unhelpful measure is trade protectionism. While it might appear that trade protectionism would correct trade deficits, it probably will not. Over the medium and long run, the economy should be producing near its natural growth path, perhaps because of timely monetary and/or fiscal policy, perhaps because of natural equilibrating forces in the economy. In this event, trade protectionism would not stimulate added national production. Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the added spending demands for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production. Put another way, equation NUM shows that the trade deficit is ultimately determined by national saving and investment. Without a change in these, protectionism merely shifts the types of goods that are produced. It does not increase overall production and, short of cutting off trade altogether, does not even change the trade balance. Moreover, as is well known, over the long run, trade protection lowers a nation's standard of living. Finally, suppose politicians actually do correct budget deficits, again assuming an economy near its medium-term growth path. As mentioned above, such a fiscal austerity policy is the only known way to correct persistent budget deficits. The reduction in deficits should lower domestic interest rates and trigger changes in exchange rates that lower imports and raise exports. Hence, well-designed fiscal austerity measures could solve all the problems simultaneously. They correct budget deficits directly, they reduce trade deficits indirectly, and the implied higher level of national saving also permits more funds to flow into capital formation and long-term productivity enhancements. Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously. Conclusions There are obviously strong links between budget and trade deficits, and the deficit-debt dynamic relationships are very similar. At the same time, it is misleading simply to equate the two deficits, as is often done in the twin-deficit literature. Budget deficits typically involve a reduction in national saving and, if large, a steadily growing government debt-to-GDP ratio. They typically will not be corrected without explicit action. Trade deficits, on the other hand, typically involve an increase in foreign claims on the U.S. economy. As these claims grow in relation to national income, at least some natural forces are set in motion to correct the imbalance. From a policy standpoint, neither deficit may be terribly harmful in the short run, and at least the recent fiscal deficits have been useful in stabilizing movements in output. Moreover, there is likely to be a credibility range in which debt levels could rise relative to GDP without much change in relative prices. In the long run, however, both deficits could become much more worrisome. There are forces tending to increase both deficits: political and demographic for budget deficits, income elasticities for trade deficits. At some point, continued large-scale trade deficits could trigger equilibrating, and possibly dislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Continued budget deficits will steadily detract from the growth of the U.S. capital stock and may also trigger dislocating changes. Appendix: Derivation of the stability condition Let P denote the primary deficit (for either budget or trade), D the debt for either, and i the nation's nominal riskless interest rate. Then apart from valuation adjustments (A1) D = D-NUM (DATE) + P Divide through by GDP (Y): (A2) D/ Y = (D-NUM /Y-NUM ) (DATE)/(DATE g) + P/Y. Use lower case letters to refer to the ratio of a variable to GDP. This ratio is a measure of the proportionate importance of the variable. (A3) d = d (DATE)/(DATE g) + p. -NUM If there is stability in the debt-to-GDP ratio, d = d -NUM = d. Then (A4) d (NUM - (DATE)/(DATE g)) = p and (A5) d (g - i)/(DATE g) = p d This is equation NUM in the text. Note that if i = g, p must equal NUM. If is positive and i > g, p must be less than zero, a primary surplus. If d is positive and i < g, p can be greater than zero, a primary deficit.",

                  "Edward M Gramlich: Budget and trade deficits - linked, both worrisome in the long run, but not twins Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress, London, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak DATE. While I know that most of you would welcome any insights I might have about current U.S. monetary policy - whether the Open Market Committee will be raising or lowering interest rates at our next meeting - I prefer to focus instead on some issues that could become serious over the longer run. These issues involve the persistent budget and trade deficits facing the American economy, issues that could eventually involve significant economic adjustments around the world.NUM Large budget and trade deficits are not a new phenomenon. They also arose in the United States in DATE. At that time, the business press and many economists began referring to the situation as one of \"twin deficits.\" With the current re-emergence of both deficits, the phrase has come back into common usage - too common, in my view. To be sure, in theoretical models there is a scenario by which budget deficits can create trade deficits, and one by which trade deficits can create budget deficits. But there are also many scenarios by which either deficit can arise independently, or even by which budget and trade deficits can move in opposite directions, as they did in DATE. In general, while budget and trade deficits can be linked, there are important differences between the two, both in how they respond to economic forces and in their long-run consequences. I start by examining the relationship between budget and trade deficits - why they are linked but not twins. I discuss the sustainability conditions for budget and trade deficits; the conditions that must be fulfilled for the debts on both accounts to be stabilized in relation to the size of the U.S. economy. Then I discuss what happens if either debt violates this condition and rises in relation to the size of the economy. This discussion, in turn, raises further interesting distinctions between the two deficits. The link The link between budget and trade deficits can be seen most naturally through the national income accounting framework. Any saving the nation does finances either private domestic investment directly or the accumulation of claims on foreigners. This means that national saving - the sum of private and government saving - equals private domestic investment plus that period's accumulation of claims on foreigners, or the trade surplus. The trade surplus can also be thought of as net foreign lending. All of these relationships are accounting identities - true at every moment in time apart from data inconsistencies captured by a statistical discrepancy. In equation form, we have NS = S - BD = I - TD (NUM) On the left side of the equation NS refers to national saving, S refers to overall private saving, and BD refers to the government budget deficit. This part of the equation says merely that total national saving equals the sum of all saving done in the economy by the private sector and the government sector. A budget surplus would be treated as governmental saving and added to private saving; a budget deficit would be treated as governmental dissaving and subtracted. The right side of the equation repeats the familiar open economy identity that national saving equals private domestic investment, I, plus the accumulation of claims on foreigners or less that domestic investment financed by foreigners. As was noted earlier, borrowing from foreigners involves either a reduction of claims on them or an increase of claims on us by them. It is by definition equal to the trade deficit TD. In the equation, then, a trade surplus means that some national saving goes to building up claims on foreigners (national saving is greater than domestic investment) while a trade deficit means that some investment is financed by foreigners (national saving is less than domestic investment). This identity first demonstrates the all-important role of national saving in shaping long-run economic welfare. National saving is the only way a country can have its capital and own it too. Models of the economic growth process identify national saving as one of the key policy variables in influencing a nation's living standards in the long run. The identity also makes clear that the budget deficit and the trade deficit can move together on a dollar-per-dollar basis, but only if the difference between private domestic investment and private saving is constant. Typically that difference will not be constant. For example, if there were to be an investment boom, interest rates might rise to induce some new private saving and some new lending by foreigners. The implied trade deficit might rise and, because of the rise in income, the budget deficit might fall. In this case, the trade deficit would increase while the budget deficit fell. Conversely, suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits. If this expansion were totally financed by borrowing from foreigners, domestic interest rates would not change much, and domestic investment and private saving might not either. In this scenario, there could be a simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change in budget and trade deficits - the classic twin-deficit scenario. Such a situation is most likely to occur in small economies fully open to international trade and capital flows, economies in which domestic interest rates are determined by world capital markets and are independent of domestic economic variables. But if domestic interest rates do change, as they likely would in either a closed economy or a large open economy, private investment and saving would also likely change, and any strict link between budget and trade deficits would be broken. One could spin any number of scenarios, but these are enough to make the basic point. Because of the underlying relationship between saving and investment, budget and trade deficits could be strictly linked. But in a large open economy like the United States, it is easy to imagine plenty of scenarios in which they are imperfectly linked, and even some scenarios in which they move in opposite directions. Budget and trade deficits should be viewed as linked, but not as twins. Stability conditions Although the economic implications and reactions of budget deficits and trade deficits differ, both are deficits. Another elementary accounting identity says that last period's debt level plus the current deficit equals the current period's debt level. This identity is true whether we are talking about budget deficits building up the stock of outstanding government debt (a liability of the government sector to the private sector), or trade deficits building up the stock of external debt (the net stock of accumulated foreign claims against the United States).NUM Economists have worried for DATE about optimal stocks of government and external debt. For government debt, the optimal stock turns out to be related to the optimal level of national saving, which can be defined as the level that maximizes the nation's long-term path of consumption per worker. The optimal stock of net external debt can be determined in the same framework from an open economy perspective. While these models can be instructive, DATE I am going to focus on a weaker standard. Whatever the long-term optimal level of government debt, and whatever the optimal level of external debt, one can separately ask whether either debt level is becoming a more, or less, important economic factor over time. For government debt, this weaker standard, or stability condition, determines merely whether the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is stable. If it is, interest payments on the debt will, in equilibrium, also settle down to a stable proportion of GDP. For external debt, a stable debt-to-GDP ratio means that the net interest and dividend payments of the United States to foreign investors will also settle down to a constant ratio to GDP. The appendix derives this stability condition generically. It is that d (g - i)/(DATE g) = p, (NUM) where d is the stable ratio of debt to GDP, g is the nominal growth rate of the economy, i is the nominal interest rate in the economy, and p is the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP. For budget accounts, the primary deficit is the national income accounts budget deficit, but excluding interest payments. For trade accounts, the primary trade deficit is the current account deficit, excluding net interest and dividend payments to foreigners.NUM As a general rule, the economy's growth rate and interest rate will be fairly close. The equation says that if they are equal, the primary deficit must be zero to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. If the interest rate is slightly above the growth rate, as it would be in models without risk for economies that save less than the theoretical optimum, a nation with outstanding debt would have to run a slight primary surplus to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio. If the effective interest rate on debt is slightly below the growth rate, as it has generally been found to be in the past for both deficits, a nation with outstanding debt could run slight primary deficits and not see the debt ratio grow.NUM On the foreign side, this condition has until now been especially forgiving. Even with a large net debt position, our net investment income from foreigners has exceeded that paid out to foreigners. Since the net interest rate has been less than the GDP growth rate, the ratio of external debt to GDP could have been stabilized with a moderate primary trade deficit.NUM Magnitudes It is well known that the U.S. economy now suffers both budget and trade deficits. But how do these deficits compare with the stability conditions? Historically, there have not been significant instabilities in U.S. federal budget deficits.NUM Overall deficits have averaged about NUM percent of GDP over DATE, but Figure NUM shows that when interest is deducted, primary budget deficits have averaged close to zero, the approximate level that stabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio. Hence, the outstanding debt, while fluctuating in the range of NUM percent to NUM percent of GDP, has actually declined slightly as a share of GDP. It was NUM percent of GDP in DATE and is now only NUM percent of GDP. The ratio did rise as high as NUM percent in the high-deficit DATE of DATE, but it dropped sharply thereafter with the primary budget surpluses of DATE. Looking ahead, things might not be so favorable. As a result of recent fiscal changes, the budget has lately fallen into primary deficit again; this primary deficit is now more than NUM percent of GDP (NUM percent after cyclical adjustment). The deterioration reflects the much-discussed recent rapid growth in expenditures, along with significant tax cuts. Perhaps more significant, in a few DATE the United States will face huge looming costs for retirement and health programs. It will take extraordinary fiscal discipline just to keep the present primary deficit near its current level of NUM to NUM percent of GDP over the short, medium, and long run. And even at that level, the stability condition is violated by at least NUM percent of GDP, suggesting that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to climb steadily upward.NUM NUM This primary trade deficit differs from the trade deficit component of GDP mentioned earlier because it includes foreign transfers and other small items. NUM Laurence Ball, Douglas W. Elmendorf, and N. Gregory Mankiw, \"The Deficit Gamble\", Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, vol. NUM, no. NUM, (DATE), pp. NUM-NUM, show that interest rates on domestic government debt have generally been slightly less than the GDP growth rate in DATE. NUM The rate-of-return puzzle is in turn a question about why foreign direct investment in the United States has such a low rate of return. See Raymond J. Mataloni, Jr., \"An Examination of the Low Rates of Return of Foreign-Owned U.S. Companies\", Survey of Current Business, vol. DATE (DATE), pp. DATE. NUM Even though the previous identity referred to the consumption budget for the entire government sector, in this section I switch over to the familiar concept of the total budget for the U.S. federal government. State and local governments more or less finance their current spending and do not have much outstanding debt apart from that backed by capital formation; and federal capital investment is very small. NUM These statements are based on estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook, DATE NUM (DATE). A further discussion of the long-run budget outlook can be found in Alan J. Auerbach, William G. Gale, Peter R. Orszag, and Samara R. Potter, \"Budget Blues: The Fiscal Outlook and Options for Reform,\" in Henry J. Aaron, James Lindsay, and Pietro Nivola (eds.), Agenda for the Nation (The Brookings Institution, DATE). See also the General Accounting Office, Truth and Transparency: The Federal Government's Financial Condition and Fiscal Outlook BIS Review NUM/NUM On the trade side, Figure NUM shows that the trend is definitely more worrisome. While the budget debt has fluctuated between NUM percent and NUM percent of GDP over DATE, the net external debt has grown steadily. Until DATE, this external debt was not even positive; that is, until that time the United States had net claims on foreigners. But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since DATE, the net external debt is now NUM percent of GDP and rising sharply. The primary trade deficit is now NUM percent of GDP, violating the stability condition by nearly this same amount. At this rate, the external debt ratio will climb very quickly. While the trade deficit does have equilibrating tendencies, as will be discussed later, there are also forces that tend to increase it. Econometric studies of the basic demand for imports and exports find that the U.S. income elasticity of demand for imports is higher than the foreign income elasticity of demand for U.S. exports. This means that even if the world economy grows at the same rate as the U.S. economy, our trade deficit is likely to widen, (apart from any changes in relative prices).NUM Indeed, the U.S. primary trade deficit has widened steadily since DATE. Adjustments I have just argued that the U.S. is now in violation of the stability condition for both budget and trade deficits - recently and moderately on the budget side, persistently and significantly on the trade side. What are the implications? With each deficit there is probably a credibility range. By that, I mean a limited range within which a country may be able to violate its stability condition and have its debt-to-GDP ratio trend upward without further economic consequences. For budgets, there may be a range within which the debtto-GDP ratio can grow without significant changes in interest rates.NUM As equation NUM indicates, economic performance in this range is by no means optimal, because the persistent deficits are subtracting funds that would otherwise be devoted to capital investment and future growth in living standards. But there may not be significant relative price effects. The same is true on the trade side; there could be a range in which foreign claims on the United States just build up without major impact on relative prices. Once the economy gets outside of the credibility range, more significant relative price adjustments become likely. On the trade side, for example, the continued accumulation of foreign claims on the U.S. economy will raise the issue of whether foreign investors will want to hold an ever-increasing share of their wealth in the form of U.S. assets. Or, as is the focus of the stability condition above, whether the U.S. economy can indefinitely pay out ever-higher shares of GDP in the form of interest and dividend payments. The conventional view is that at some point there should be a relative price adjustment - some combination of rising U.S. interest rates (to make U.S. assets more attractive), rising foreign prices (to make imports more expensive), moderating U.S. prices (to make U.S. exports more competitive), or a change in exchange rates. Each of these reactions is likely to occur naturally, and each moves in the direction of lowering the external imbalance. That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting. The main risk here is that the natural adjustments may not occur gradually, but so rapidly as to threaten various types of dislocations. There are complicating factors. One involves the currency denomination of the net debt. Countries with large trade deficits often have their external liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Hence, when their own currency depreciates, the value and burden of foreign debt automatically increases. The United States does not have this problem because most of its debt is denominated in dollars - say, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills. If the dollar were to fall, the value of our debt in terms of foreign currencies would then automatically decline, inducing foreign wealth-holders to make further portfolio shifts, perhaps even including increasing their stock of dollar-denominated debt. This denomination effect would not permanently prevent any relative price adjustment, but it could lengthen the process. Beyond that, for pragmatic reasons this conventional adjustment process could be extended or distorted even further. By way of illustration, Asian central banks have now accumulated more than a trillion dollars of international currency reserves - largely in dollar-denominated assets - equal to roughly half of the outstanding net debt of the United States. These central banks are not traditional wealth-holders motivated by expected risks and returns. Instead, they seem motivated more by the prospect of preserving low domestic currency values for their exporters.NUM To pursue this objective, they can print money to buy U.S. securities. This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities - and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible. But if these central banks continue behaving this way, the so-called credibility range could be extended significantly. While trade deficits should ultimately correct themselves, perhaps after a long trek through the credibility range, there are really no natural self-corrective mechanisms for budget deficits. Once the U.S. economy gets through the credibility range, interest rates on the increasing government debt will have to rise to induce people to hold the debt. This rise increases the interest burden and causes total deficits to rise further, all the time subtracting more and more funds from capital accumulation. Once this process begins, market psychology may hasten the adjustment.NUM Hence, while natural forces lessen the basic external imbalance, they increase the basic budget imbalance. In the long run, the only way to correct budget deficits is for policymakers to correct them. Outside forces There are several outside forces - both natural and as a result of policy - that could influence budget and trade deficits. One generally helpful influence is productivity growth. Say the U.S. economy benefits from an exogenous positive shock to productivity growth, as it seemed to have in DATE. This shock would raise the trend path of income, meaning that slightly higher primary budget and trade deficits could still be consistent with debt-to-GDP stability; in effect, a higher level of g can be plugged into equation NUM (at least as long as it is not offset by a higher i). Higher productivity could also help lengthen the credibility range, the range in which moderate changes in the debt ratio might not lead to adverse changes in relative prices. Among other things, higher productivity could raise the marginal product of capital and make investment in U.S. assets relatively attractive. But even with these favorable developments, the stability conditions discussed above still hold. If they are violated, the natural adjustment mechanisms will eventually take over for the trade deficit, and the primary budget deficit will eventually have to be reduced to stop a growing government debt ratio. One unhelpful measure is trade protectionism. While it might appear that trade protectionism would correct trade deficits, it probably will not. Over the medium and long run, the economy should be producing near its natural growth path, perhaps because of timely monetary and/or fiscal policy, perhaps because of natural equilibrating forces in the economy. In this event, trade protectionism would not stimulate added national production. Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the added spending demands for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production. Put another way, equation NUM shows that the trade deficit is ultimately determined by national saving and investment. Without a change in these, protectionism merely shifts the types of goods that are produced. It does not increase overall production and, short of cutting off trade altogether, does not even change the trade balance. Moreover, as is well known, over the long run, trade protection lowers a nation's standard of living. Finally, suppose politicians actually do correct budget deficits, again assuming an economy near its medium-term growth path. As mentioned above, such a fiscal austerity policy is the only known way to correct persistent budget deficits. The reduction in deficits should lower domestic interest rates and trigger changes in exchange rates that lower imports and raise exports. Hence, well-designed fiscal austerity measures could solve all the problems simultaneously. They correct budget deficits directly, they reduce trade deficits indirectly, and the implied higher level of national saving also permits more funds to flow into capital formation and long-term productivity enhancements. Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously. Conclusions There are obviously strong links between budget and trade deficits, and the deficit-debt dynamic relationships are very similar. At the same time, it is misleading simply to equate the two deficits, as is often done in the twin-deficit literature. Budget deficits typically involve a reduction in national saving and, if large, a steadily growing government debt-to-GDP ratio. They typically will not be corrected without explicit action. Trade deficits, on the other hand, typically involve an increase in foreign claims on the U.S. economy. As these claims grow in relation to national income, at least some natural forces are set in motion to correct the imbalance. From a policy standpoint, neither deficit may be terribly harmful in the short run, and at least the recent fiscal deficits have been useful in stabilizing movements in output. Moreover, there is likely to be a credibility range in which debt levels could rise relative to GDP without much change in relative prices. In the long run, however, both deficits could become much more worrisome. There are forces tending to increase both deficits: political and demographic for budget deficits, income elasticities for trade deficits. At some point, continued large-scale trade deficits could trigger equilibrating, and possibly dislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Continued budget deficits will steadily detract from the growth of the U.S. capital stock and may also trigger dislocating changes. Appendix: Derivation of the stability condition Let P denote the primary deficit (for either budget or trade), D the debt for either, and i the nation's nominal riskless interest rate. Then apart from valuation adjustments D = D-NUM (DATE) + P (A1) Divide through by GDP (Y): D/ Y = (D-NUM /Y-NUM ) (DATE)/(DATE g) + P/Y. (A2) Use lower case letters to refer to the ratio of a variable to GDP. This ratio is a measure of the proportionate importance of the variable. d = d (DATE)/(DATE g) + p. (A3) -NUM If there is stability in the debt-to-GDP ratio, d = d -NUM = d. Then d (NUM - (DATE)/(DATE g)) = p (A4) and d (g - i)/(DATE g) = p (A5) This is equation NUM in the text. Note that if i = g, p must equal NUM. If d is positive and i > g, p must be less than zero, a primary surplus. If d is positive and i < g, p can be greater than zero, a primary deficit.",

                  "Rodrigo de Rato: The IMF in a changing world (keynote address) Keynote address by Mr Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, at the Joint IMF-Bundesbank Symposium \"The IMF in a changing world\", Frankfurt, DATE.    Thank you, Mr. Stark, for that opening and introduction. Good TIME - It is a great pleasure to be here DATE among this impressive gathering of experts from many countries. Let me first thank the German authorities for graciously hosting this conference. Their organization of this event is much appreciated. As you know, the IMF was established DATE. The world economy has witnessed dramatic changes since that time. For instance, our membership has grown four-fold, from around NUM to NUM. The world's financial landscape has also been dramatically altered by the rise of private international capital flows. Throughout the changes of DATE, the IMF has continually evolved to meet the needs of its members and the international economic system. It is in that spirit of evolution and renewal that we meet DATE to discuss issues related to the international monetary system, financial stability and, more broadly, the IMF's role in the world economy. My remarks this TIME may be conveniently divided into three sections:  The origins of the IMF, addressing its purposes, objectives, and mandates.  Main changes to the IMF since its establishment, and the reasons for those changes.  Some thoughts on the future role of the IMF in the international monetary system. In going through these subjects, it is my hope that the developments and ideas in each section will provide useful context for your panel discussions later DATE. The IMF and its origins We live DATE in a highly globalized and integrated world. However, some analysts may suggest that the global economy was actually more integrated at DATE than it is now. In DATE, nationalism and protectionism disrupted this integration, setting off the Great Depression and contributing to World War II. The IMF - and the World Bank, its sister institution - were established to restore an open system of trade and finance, help countries rebuild from the war and, in the process, hopefully build a new era of world peace and prosperity. Against that background, a key part of the IMF's mandate DATE is the promotion and maintenance of monetary and financial stability, both in individual countries and at the international level. Stability is the foundation for sustained economic growth, and crisis prevention and resolution is an integral part of our work. The IMF discharges this mandate in a variety of ways, including the following. First, it provides the framework and mechanisms for international economic cooperation. With increasing integration in the world economy, the importance of this aspect cannot be overstated. Second, it helps countries design macroeconomic policies that achieve and maintain high levels of employment and income. The promotion of open economies and trade is a key element of these policies. Third, the IMF helps in the orderly correction of a country's balance of payments problems by providing temporary financing. The ways in which we carry out our operations are also unique in several respects. Broadly-speaking, these may be divided into three categories of activities:  Surveillance - This involves the monitoring of economic and financial conditions, both at the global level and in individual countries. For the IMF, surveillance is a central instrument for maintaining monetary and financial stability. By obliging each IMF member to engage in a regular consultation with us on its economic policies, the surveillance process also explicitly recognizes the role that all countries play in maintaining global stability.  Lending - Our financing role is focused in assisting members with balance of payments adjustments. Through the temporary provision of funds, IMF lending gives members breathing room to implement policy measures to overcome underlying economic problems. For the poorest countries, financing may be provided on concessional terms, and with longer maturities. The availability of IMF funds to assist in economic adjustment gives confidence to members and the international system as a whole, since it lowers the incentive for countries to take adjustment measures which are damaging to the national and international economies.  Technical Assistance - Technical advice and assistance is provided to member countries in areas of the IMF's expertise, primarily in macroeconomic and financial policymaking. By helping to build institutional and human capacity for the making of sound economic policies, IMF technical assistance contributes to the building of strong economies and stable growth. The IMF's purposes, and its operational activities, were therefore designed with a key objective in mind - that is, the fostering of healthy national economies, linked by finance and trade, as the foundation for a robust global economic system. I think it correct to say that this vision for international peace and stability has produced remarkable results, for DATE have been a period of growing economic prosperity and freedom. Global per capita income has more than tripled, and most of the world has experienced major improvements in literacy and life expectancy. Among the biggest gainers have been the developing nations, home to half of the world's population. Many of them have been quick to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the global economy, especially during DATE. These countries - whose ranks include Brazil, Chile, China, India, Korea, and Mexico - were able to double their share in world trade, raise per capita incomes, and lift millions out of poverty. Their experience demonstrates that integration into the global economy can bring major benefits. The IMF's evolution The world has witnessed many changes and developments - in technology, politics, culture, as well as economics - over DATE, and the IMF has adapted itself accordingly. At the time of IMF's establishment, our economic policy advice focused mainly on helping members to shape sound macroeconomic and financial policies, within the disciplines of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. The breakdown of that system in DATE, and the resultant Second Amendment of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, led to a re-orientation of the IMF's functions. In particular, the revision of Article IV, and the introduction of the surveillance process, explicitly recognized the close relationship between domestic economic policies and international stability. To DATE, this forms the basis for our systematic and comprehensive review of economic conditions and policies in each member country. Similarly, the wave of de-colonization that swept the world from DATE onwards placed new and complex responsibilities on the Fund. The IMF quickly found that countries looked to it for advice and assistance beyond the traditional macroeconomic areas of fiscal policy, monetary policy, and exchange rate systems. In addition to these subjects, IMF advice and assistance were also sought on establishing the institutions of monetary and fiscal policy, and on supply-side structural policies to help promote sustained growth. In DATE, following DATE the Cold War, new challenges were created in this regard by the transition of former centrally-planned economies to market-based systems. Through our work in these areas, it also became increasingly clear that structural and institutional issues were important for stability and growth in other member countries too, including the major industrial economies. The area of IMF financing has also seen great transformation. For example, although IMF lending continues to be targeted at short-term balance of payments needs, our financing instruments have, for DATE, included concessional lending for low-income countries. In response to the rapid development of international capital markets as a major source of financing for countries, special IMF financing policies have also been put in place to assist countries facing capitalaccount driven crises. Related to these capital market developments, the Fund also began to play an unanticipated role in facilitating the resolution of sovereign debt problems. This function became critically important following the emergence of the debt crisis in DATE, and it remains so DATE. All of these changes - ranging from de-colonization and transition, to the rapid development of private international capital flows and new instruments, to the emergence of capital-account driven crises - posed new challenges for the IMF. In many cases, these developments touched upon issues which lay at the frontiers of economic knowledge and research. Addressing them has led to a significant transformation of the Fund, including a broadening of the skills mix of Fund staff, greater dialogue with private financial sectors, and more involvement in institutional development in member countries. In the process, the IMF has also become a more open and transparent institution. Meeting the needs of the future To continue to serve the interests of our member countries and the international community at large, the IMF has to be in a position to deal with the influences that are expected to shape the global economy in DATE. We must not remain static, nor must we change only in a reactive manner when forced to. For that reason, I have initiated an examination of the Fund's medium-term strategic direction. We hope to use this opportunity to explore a variety of issues and their implications for the work of the IMF. These include matters like global financial flows, regional integration, efforts to reduce poverty, and questions concerning global governance, transparency, and accountability. We are still in the early stages of the review, and there have been many preliminary ideas floated and discussed. At this juncture, it is important for all of us to remain flexible and open-minded, particularly to views and opinions from outside the IMF. However, there is a sense that the continuing evolution of the Fund must remain grounded in the institution's key areas of responsibility, as specified in our Articles of Agreement - that is, to facilitate international monetary cooperation, to foster a liberal system of international trade and payments, and to promote macroeconomic and financial stability, as a condition for sustained growth. As we ponder how best to meet the challenges of the future, there appears a strong case that the IMF should remain anchored to its core macroeconomic and financial areas of mandate and expertise. The Fund's governing organs - including our Executive Board and the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) - are already actively engaged in this review. They have had various occasions to consider this matter, and I would like to use this opportunity to present some of the key ideas that have emerged in discussion, in the following five areas: surveillance, financial sector and capital markets work, Fund financing and lending, our assistance to low-income countries, and internal management and governance. First, on surveillance, both the IMF's Executive Board and the IMFC share my vision that a central task of the Fund lies in a stronger and better-focused surveillance process. IMF surveillance provides the foundation for cooperation among our members in the promotion of stability and growth in the global economy. With increased trade and financial linkages among nations, and strong connections between economic performance, poverty, and security issues, such cooperation to address shared problems is now more important than ever. For instance, the IMF has repeatedly pointed to the need to address current global imbalances, so as to reinforce the basis for more balanced and sustainable global growth. The existing relatively benign global outlook provides an excellent window of opportunity to do that, and the IMF serves as a ready vehicle through which to cooperate on the necessary actions. With respect to individual countries, we should continue working to strengthen the bilateral surveillance process. While focused on the country at hand, it would be important that bilateral surveillance be fully-informed by regional and global perspectives as well. Systemically important countries will clearly continue to deserve special attention. Operationally, our respective country teams will remain the focal points for our activities in individual members. At the same time, country teams will continue to draw upon specialized expertise where necessary, from both inside and outside of the Fund. To maintain overall coherence, it would be important for efforts to continue in the integration and sharing of information among country teams and specialized experts. Second, our work in financial sectors and capital markets. The IMF is the one international organization capable of carrying out financial sector surveillance universally and comprehensively. Further efforts will be needed to realize this potential, not least by deepening the IMF's role in anticipating sources of instability in national and global financial markets, and in generating timely action to address them. The IMF will continue to help countries strengthen their financial sectors, including in following up on the findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercises. One important aspect of this will be to help members adapt their prudential and administrative frameworks to benefit more from private capital flows. As national financial sectors become increasingly integrated and interdependent, another top priority for us must be to strengthen our understanding of the factors that drive global capital asset allocation, and the reasons for capital flows across sectors and national borders. Early identification and assessment of capital flows will help us evaluate vulnerabilities in a timely manner, as well as enhance countries' ability to address them. The effectiveness of our bilateral and multilateral surveillance activities will also be strengthened as a result. For members who wish to access international capital markets and integrate their economies more fully into the global financial system, we can provide advice on the appropriate sequencing of measures, such as how to strengthen their financial sectors and reduce their vulnerability to shocks as preparatory steps. Third, IMF financing and lending. The Fund's traditional role of providing financing to help smooth the adjustment of temporary current-account imbalances remains vital for many countries. For others, our main task is to help prevent, or mitigate, capital account crises and their cross-border contagion effects. To succeed in these roles, the IMF must be able to exercise selectivity in supporting only those adjustment programs that will put the relevant members firmly on the path to external viability. The existence of robust domestic institutional frameworks, and strong national ownership of programs, would be key. Building on these principles, we will continue working towards a clearer consensus on the appropriate circumstances and scale for IMF lending, the possible need for additional financial instruments, and the adequacy of the present framework for the orderly resolution of sovereign debt problems. Fourth, the Fund's role in low-income countries. Low-income countries present the international community with some profound challenges. Over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, and hundreds of millions are affected by disease. Addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, in particular, will be critical for growth and poverty reduction in many developing countries. Achieving durable economic growth in these countries - which is essential for lasting poverty reduction and reaching the Millennium Development Goals - will therefore require a strong social framework as well as sound economic policies. On our part, the IMF can help countries put in place policies and systems to effectively manage the increased and large inflows of aid that could be forthcoming in response to the HIV/AIDs crisis. Importantly, lasting poverty reduction can only be achieved with stable and sustained growth. The IMF, with our mandate in promoting economic stability, can help countries to put in place strong macroeconomic frameworks that will lead to economic expansion and debt sustainability. As in everything else that we do, we must ensure that our assistance to low-income countries continues to fit their particular needs and circumstances. Some issues which may warrant closer examination include:  Ensuring that resources in the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility - our main lending instrument for developing countries - remain adequate to meet future demands;  New ways to help low-income countries deal with economic shocks;  In the case of low-income countries which do not need or want IMF lending, how to enhance the IMF's role in signaling to others the strength of these countries' policies;  The role of the Fund in supporting low-income countries' poverty reduction strategies; and  Our relationship with donors and aid agencies. As a partner of the DATE Monterrey Consensus, the IMF is committed to supporting countries in their efforts to reduce poverty and reach the Millennium Development Goals. Our unique position gives us the potential to contribute to building both pillars of the Monterrey Consensus. On one side, we can work with countries to design policies and build institutions that will help them grow out of poverty. On the other, we can advocate for more and better international support, and help with its coordination. Nevertheless, examining the issues highlighted earlier will help frame a better understanding of the areas of low-income country work for which the IMF can take responsibility, and those that will fall to other institutions and actors. It would be helpful to have greater definition in this area as we approach the U.N. Millennium Summit in DATE. To maintain the IMF's effectiveness, it is Fifth, the IMF's internal governance and management. essential for our membership to resolve the difficult issues that have been raised about our own governance - notably, the voice and participation of emerging market economies and developing countries in our institution. All members countries should have adequate voice and participation in the IMF's decision-making, and the distribution of our quotas should reflect developments in the global economy. In this connection, the ongoing 13th general review of IMF quotas provides an opportunity to make progress on this front. Further, given the demands placed on the IMF by its members, it is clear that the institution's resources must be commensurate with the tasks it is asked to perform. This ongoing strategic review will help us to identify needs, define priorities, and consider possibilities to redeploy resources from lower-priority areas. Regardless of the outcome, IMF management, and our Executive Board, are committed to making the most effective use of resources entrusted to them by our membership. Efforts must therefore continue in the search for greater efficiency gains. One important aspect of this concerns the cooperation and division of labor between the IMF, the World Bank, and other international organizations. This is an issue which may bear revisiting, and I am very much looking forward to working with President Wolfowitz, and to learning his views and vision for the Bank. Conclusion This conference's organizers have put together an excellent program that addresses many of the points I have touched upon - from international financial stability, to capital market integration, to financial crisis resolution, to IMF governance. In these and other areas, work is underway on a medium-term strategy that will guide the IMF's priorities and decision-making over DATE. Your discussions will therefore provide valuable insights for that medium-term strategy, which we hope to finalize by the time of the DATE Annual Meetings in DATE. Subsequently, I anticipate that the debate on longer-term issues, relating for instance to global governance and the future structure of the international monetary system, will continue, both within and outside the Fund. I look forward to your contributions to that debate as well. Thank you once again for your presence and participation in this symposium. As we consider how the IMF can best serve its membership and the world, it is indeed a great privilege to be able to tap into your wealth of experience and knowledge on some of the issues that lie at the heart of our institution's mandate.",

                  "Alan Greenspan: Current account Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Economic Club of New York, New York, DATE.    It has been a number of DATE since the foreign exchange rate of the dollar has played so prominent a role in evaluations of economic activity. I have no intention DATE of discussing the foreign exchange policy of the United States. That is the province of the Secretary of the Treasury. Nor do I intend to project exchange rates. My experience is that exchange markets have become so efficient that virtually all relevant information is embedded almost instantaneously in exchange rates to the point that anticipating movements in major currencies is rarely possible. The exceptions to this conclusion are those few cases of successful speculation in which governments have tried and failed to support a particular exchange rate. Nonetheless, despite extensive efforts on the part of analysts, to my knowledge, no model projecting directional movements in exchange rates is significantly superior to tossing a coin. I am aware that of the thousands who try, some are quite successful. So are winners of coin-tossing contests. The seeming ability of a number of banking organizations to make consistent profits from foreign exchange trading likely derives not from their insight into future rate changes but from market making. This may seem a rather surprising conclusion, given that so many commentators apparently believe that they know the real value of the dollar must decline further because of the record current account deficit of the United States. It should be sobering to recall that three DATE ago - February NUM - to be exact for similar reasons a vast majority of a large panel of forecasters were projecting a lower dollar against the euro. In the subsequent DATE, the dollar rose nearly NUM percent against the euro. Rather than engage in exchange rate forecasting, DATE I will discuss certain developments in foreign exchange markets, and in the international financial system in general, which bear on the ultimate outcome of our current account adjustment process. Before raising the broader issues of adjustment, I should like to address the actions of certain of the players in the exchange market that are likely to delay the adjustment process, but only for a time. I refer to the heavy degree of intervention by East Asian monetary authorities, especially in Japan and China, and the apparent stepped up hedging of currency movements by exporters, especially in Europe. As all of you who follow these markets are aware, since DATE, the extraordinary purchases by Asian central banks and governments of dollar assets, largely those by Japan and China, have totaled almost $NUM billion, all in an apparent attempt to prevent their currencies from rising against the dollar. In particular, total foreign exchange reserves for China reached $NUM billion in DATE and for Japan more than $NUM billion in DATE. The awesome size of Japan's accumulation results from persistent intervention to suppress what Japanese authorities have judged is a dollar-yen exchange rate that is out of line with fundamentals. One factor boosting the yen is a significant yen bias on the part of Japanese investors. This propensity, in my judgment, runs far beyond the normal tendency of investors worldwide to buy familiar domestic assets and eschew foreign-exchange risk. Nowhere else in the world will investors voluntarily purchase DATE government obligations at an interest rate of NUM percent or less, especially given a rate of increase in the outstanding supply of government debt that has generally been running at NUM percent over DATE. Not surprisingly, very few Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are held outside of Japan. Aside from the holdings of the Bank of Japan, almost all JGBs are held by Japanese households, banks, insurance companies and the postal saving system. And none of them holds significant amounts of foreign assets; NUM percent of household assets are in yen, and, including the postal saving system, about NUM percent of the assets of financial institutions are in yen. Japanese nonfinancial corporations do hold a larger share of foreign assets in their securities' portfolios, but the absolute amounts are small. The Japanese have made significant foreign direct investments, especially in the United States, and the Ministry of Finance does, of course, hold large dollar balances as a consequence of exchange rate intervention. But the Japanese private sector, by and large, has exhibited limited interest in accumulating dollar or other foreign assets, removing what in other large trading economies would be a significant segment of demand for foreign assets. The degree of domestic currency bias in Japan, which far exceeds that of its trading partners, may thus have contributed to a foreign exchange rate for the yen that appears to be elevated relative to the dollar and possibly other internationally traded currencies as well.NUM Of course, this preference for yen assets, while a persistent influence on the value of the yen, has at times been overwhelmed by other factors. Granted the level of intervention pursued by the Japanese monetary authorities has influenced the market value of the yen, but the size of the impact is difficult to judge. In any event, it must be presumed that the rate of accumulation of dollar assets by the Japanese government will have to slow at some point and eventually cease. For now, partially unsterilized intervention is perceived as a means of expanding the monetary base of Japan, a basic element of monetary policy. (The same effect, of course, is available through the purchase of domestic assets.) In time, however, as the present deflationary situation abates, the monetary consequences of continued intervention could become problematic. The current performance of the Japanese economy suggests that we are getting closer to the point where continued intervention at the present scale will no longer meet the monetary policy needs of Japan. China is a similar story. In order to maintain the tight relationship with the dollar initiated in DATE, the Chinese central bank has chosen to purchase large quantities of U.S. Treasury securities with renminbi. What is not clear is how much of the current upward pressure on the currency results from underlying market forces, how much from capital inflows owing to speculation on potential revaluation, and how much from capital controls that suppress the demand of Chinese residents for dollars and other currencies. No one truly knows whether easing or ending capital controls would lessen pressure on the currency and, in the process, also eliminate inflows from speculation on a revaluation. Many in China, however, fear that an immediate ending of controls could induce capital outflows large enough to destabilize the nation's improving, but still fragile, banking system. Others believe that decontrol, but at a gradual pace, could conceivably avoid such an outcome. Chinese central bank purchases of dollars, unless offset, threaten an excess of so-called high-powered money expansion and a consequent overheating of the Chinese economy. The Chinese central bank DATE offset - that is, sterilized - much of its heavy dollar purchases by reducing its loans to commercial banks, by selling bonds, and by increasing reserve requirements. But the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base in China has been rising steadily for a number of DATE as financial efficiency improves. Thus the modest rise that has occurred in currency and commercial bank reserves has been enough to support a DATE growth of the M2 money supply in the neighborhood of NUM percent through DATE and a bit less so far DATE. Should this pattern continue, the central bank will be confronted with the choice of curtailing its purchases of dollar assets or facing an overheated economy with the associated economic instabilities. Lesser dollar purchases presumably would allow the renminbi, at least temporarily, to appreciate against the dollar. Other East Asian monetary authorities, in an endeavor to hold their currencies at a par with the yen and the renminbi, accumulated about $NUM billion in reserves in DATE and appear to have continued that rate of intervention since.    There is a general view that this heavy intervention places upward pressure on the euro. It is assumed that the dollar's trade-weighted exchange rate reflects its worldwide fundamentals, and therefore if the Asian currencies are being suppressed, the euro and other non-Asian currencies need to appreciate as an offset. But a more likely possibility is that Asian currency intervention has had little effect on other currencies and that the trade-weighted average of the dollar is, thus, somewhat elevated relative to the rate that would have prevailed absent intervention. When Asian authorities intervene to ease their currencies against the dollar, they purchase dollar-denominated assets from private sector portfolios. With fewer dollar assets in private hands, the natural inclination to rebalance portfolios will tend to buoy the dollar even against currencies that are not used in intervention operations, including the euro. These transactions raise the dollar against, for example, the yen, lower the yen against the euro, and lower the euro against the dollar. The strength of the euro against the dollar thus appears to be the consequence of forces unrelated to Asian intervention. As I will explain later, this does not mean that when Asian intervention ceases the dollar will automatically fall because other influences on the dollar cannot be foreseen. Some have argued that purchases of U.S. Treasuries by Asian officials are holding down interest rates on these instruments, and therefore U.S. interest rates are likely to rise as intervention by Asian monetary authorities slows, ceases, or even turns to net sales. While there are obvious reasons to be concerned about such an outcome, the effect of a reduction in the scale of intervention, or even net sales, on U.S. financial markets would likely be small. The reason is that central bank reserves are heavily concentrated in short-term maturities; moreover, the overall market in short-term dollar assets, combining both public and private instruments, is huge relative to the size of asset holdings of Asian monetary authorities. And because these issues are short-term and hence capable of only limited price change, realized capital losses, if any, would be small. Accordingly, any incentive for monetary authorities to sell dollars, in order to preserve market value, would be muted.    A different issue arises with the apparent level of hedging by exporters in Europe and elsewhere. The effect, however, is the same as Asian official intervention: It slows the process of adjustment. Against a broad basket of currencies of our trading partners, the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar has declined about NUM percent from its peak in DATE. Ordinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in the dollar prices of our imported goods and services, because foreign exporters seek to avoid price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Reflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and services imported into the United States have begun to rise after declining on balance for several DATE. But the turnaround to date has been moderate and far short of that implied by the exchange rate change. Apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to absorb some of the price decline measured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on profit margins it entails in order to hold market share. In fact, given that the nearly NUM percent rise in dollar prices of goods imported from western Europe since DATE has been far short of the rise in the euro, profit margins of euro-area exporters to the United States may well have turned negative. Nonetheless, euro-area exports to the United States, when expressed in euros, have slowed only modestly. A possible reason is that European exporters' incentives to sell to the United States were diminished significantly less than indicated by the dollar price and exchange rate movements owing to accelerated short forward positions against the dollar in foreign exchange markets. A marked increase in foreign exchange derivative trading, especially in dollar-euro, according to the Bank for International Settlements, is consistent with increased hedging of exports to the United States and to other markets that use currencies tied to the U.S. dollar.NUM However, most contracts are short-term because long-term hedging is expensive. Thus, although hedging may delay, and perhaps even smooth out, the adjustment, it cannot eliminate, without prohibitive cost, the consequences of exchange rate change. Accordingly, the currency depreciation that we have experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as foreign producers export less to the United States. On the other side of the ledger, the current account should improve as U.S. firms find the export market more receptive. But in the process, dollar prices of imports will surely rise.    When the temporary forestalling of the U.S. balance of payments adjustment process comes to an end, does that suggest a steepening of the decline in the dollar's exchange rate? As I pointed out in the beginning, the most sophisticated analytical techniques have been unable to profitably project the exchange rates of major currencies. Yet, most commentators argue that because the current account deficit must eventually narrow, the price-adjusted value of the dollar must accordingly decline. But how can exchange rates and the current account be systematically related, if exchange rates are inherently unpredictable? The answer is that the point at which the U.S. current account deficit will be forced to narrow is itself inherently difficult to predict. The current account reflects the myriad forces that bring our transactions with foreign economies into balance at our borders, of which exchange rates are only one. But those forces that, in the end, are reflected in a current account surplus or deficit are both domestic and foreign. Indeed, our current account balance can be shown to be exactly equal to the difference between domestic saving and domestic investment. In fact, it is often instructive in longer-term analysis to view our current account in terms of its domestic counterparts. As I pointed out in a speech last November,NUM virtually all of our trading partners share our inclination to invest a disproportionate percentage of domestic savings in domestic capital assets, irrespective of their differential rates of return. People seem to prefer to invest in familiar local businesses even where currency and country risks do not exist. For the United States, studies have shown that individual investors and even professional money managers have a slight preference for investments in their own communities and states. Trust, so crucial an aspect of investing, is most likely to be fostered by the familiarity of local communities. As a consequence, \"home bias\" will likely continue to constrain the movement of world savings into its optimum use as capital investment, thus limiting the internationalization of financial intermediation and hence the growth of external assets and liabilities and the dispersion of world current account balances that such growth implies. Nonetheless, during DATE, home bias has apparently declined significantly. For most of the earlier post World War II era, the correlation between domestic saving rates and domestic investment rates across the world's major economies, a conventional measure of home bias, was exceptionally high.NUM For the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) , the GDP-weighted correlation coefficient was NUM in DATE. However, it fell from NUM in DATE to less than NUM in DATE. For OECD countries excluding the United States, the recent decline is even more pronounced. These declines, not surprisingly, mirror the rise in the differences between saving and investment or, equivalently, of the dispersion of current account balances over the same DATE. The decline in home bias probably reflects an increased international tendency for financial systems to be more transparent, open, and supportive of strong investor protection.NUM Moreover, vast improvements in information and communication technologies have broadened investors' vision to the point that foreign investment appears less exotic and risky. Accordingly, the trend of declining home bias and expanding international financial intermediation will likely continue. This process has enabled the United States to incur and finance a much larger current account deficit than would have been feasible in DATE. It is quite difficult to contemplate foreign savings in an amount equivalent to NUM percent of U.S. GDP being transferred to the United States DATE.    It is unclear whether the burden of servicing our growing external liabilities or the rising weight of U.S. assets in global portfolios will impose the greater restraint on current account dispersion over the longer term. Either way, when that point arrives, will the process of reining in our current account deficit be benign to the economies of the United States and the world? According to a Federal Reserve staff study, current account deficits that emerged among developed countries since DATE have risen as high as double-digit percentages of GDP before markets enforced a reversal.NUM The median high has been about NUM percent of GDP. Complicating the evaluation of the timing of a turnaround is that deficit countries, both developed and emerging, borrow in international markets largely in dollars rather than in their domestic currency. The United States has been rare in its ability to finance its external deficit in a reserve currency. This ability has presumably enlarged the capability of the United States relative to most of our trading partners to incur foreign debt. Besides experiences with the current account deficits of other countries, there are few useful guideposts of how high our country's net foreign liabilities can mount. The foreign accumulation of U.S. assets would likely slow if dollar assets, irrespective of their competitive return, came to occupy too large a share of the world's portfolio of store of value assets. In these circumstances, investors would seek greater diversification in non-dollar assets. At the end of DATE, U.S. dollars accounted for about NUM percent of the foreign exchange reserves of foreign monetary authorities, with the euro second at NUM percent. Approximately half of private cross-border holdings were denominated in dollars, with one-third in euros.    More important than the way that the adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit will be initiated is the effect of the adjustment on both our economy and the economies of our trading partners. The history of such adjustments has been mixed. According to the aforementioned Federal Reserve study of current account corrections in developed countries, although the large majority of episodes were characterized by some significant slowing of economic growth, most economies managed the adjustment without crisis. The institutional strengths of many of these developed economies - rule of law, transparency, and investor and property protection - likely helped to minimize disruptions associated with current account adjustments. The United Kingdom, however, had significant adjustment difficulties in its early postwar DATE, as did, more recently, Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Russia, Brazil, and Argentina, to name just a few. Can market forces incrementally defuse a worrisome buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so? The answer seems to lie with the degree of flexibility in both domestic and international markets. In domestic economies that approach full flexibility, imbalances are likely to be adjusted well before they become potentially destabilizing. In a similarly flexible world economy, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates could change, presumably to reestablish global balance. The experience over DATE of trade and finance among the individual states that make up the United States comes close to that paradigm of flexibility even though exchange rates among the states have been fixed. Although we have scant data on cross-border transactions among the separate states, anecdotal evidence suggests that over DATE significant apparent imbalances have been resolved without precipitating interstate balance of payments crises. The dispersion of unemployment rates among the states, one measure of imbalances, spikes during periods of economic stress but rapidly returns to modest levels, reflecting a high degree of adjustment flexibility. That flexibility is even more apparent in regional money markets, where interest rates that presumably reflect differential imbalances in states' current accounts and hence cross-border borrowing requirements have, in recent DATE, exhibited very little interstate dispersion. This observation suggests either negligible cross-state-border imbalances, an unlikely occurrence given the pattern of state unemployment dispersion, or more likely very rapid financial adjustments.    We may not be able to usefully determine at what point foreign accumulation of net claims on the United States will slow or even reverse, but it is evident that the greater the degree of international flexibility, the less the risk of a crisis.NUM The experience of the United States over the past three DATE is illustrative. The apparent ability of our economy to withstand a number of severe shocks since DATE, with only a small decline in real GDP, attests to the marked increase in our economy's flexibility over DATE century.NUM    In evaluating the nature of the adjustment process, we need to ask whether there is something special in the dollar being the world's primary reserve currency. With so few historical examples of dominant world reserve currencies, we are understandably inclined to look to the experiences of the dollar's immediate predecessor. At the height of sterling's role as the world's currency DATE, Great Britain had net external assets amounting to some NUM percent of its DATE GDP, most of which were lost in World Wars I and II. Britain in the early post World War II period was hobbled with periodic sterling crises when much of the remnants of Empire endeavored to disengage themselves from heavy reliance on holding sterling assets as central bank reserves and private stores of value. The experience of Britain's then extensively regulated economy, harboring many wartime controls well beyond the end of hostilities, provides testimony to the costs of structural rigidity in times of crisis.    Should globalization be allowed to proceed and thereby create an ever more flexible international financial system, history suggests that the odds are favorable that current imbalances will be defused with little disruption to the economy or financial markets. But there are other outcomes that are less benign, and we must endeavor to limit the likelihood of these outcomes. One avenue by which to lessen the risk of a more difficult adjustment is for us to restore fiscal discipline. The rise in national saving that would accompany a reduction in the federal budget deficit will alleviate some of the burden of adjustment that would otherwise be required of the private sector through movements in asset prices. Even more worrisome than the lack of fiscal restraint are the clouds of emerging protectionism that have become increasingly visible on DATE's horizon. Over the DATE, protected interests have often endeavored to stop in its tracks the process of unsettling economic change. Pitted against the powerful forces of market competition, virtually all such efforts have failed. The costs of any new such protectionist initiatives, in the context of wide current account imbalances, could significantly erode the flexibility of the global economy. Consequently, it is imperative that creeping protectionism be thwarted and reversed.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: International monetary reform and capital freedom Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Cato Institute 22nd Annual Monetary Conference, Washington, DC, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    The free movement of capital across borders has created, and will certainly continue to create, enormous economic benefits. Capital flows afford developing countries and other regions the means to exploit promising investment opportunities, while providing savers around the globe the means both to earn higher returns and to reduce risk through international portfolio diversification. Access to international capital markets also permits nations to accumulate foreign assets in good times and to deplete those assets or to borrow in bad times, mitigating the effects on living standards of shocks to domestic income and production. In DATE, global capital flows have attained record highs relative to global income, reflecting both the powerful tendency of capital to seek the highest return and a concerted international effort to dismantle political and regulatory barriers to capital mobility. The issue I would like to address DATE is the role of monetary policy, and in particular the choice of the exchange rate regime, in enabling economies to take the maximum advantage of the increasing openness and depth of international capital markets. I should begin by noting that the views I will express DATE are my responsibility and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.NUM The discussion of monetary policy and capital flows almost inevitably begins with the well-known \"trilemma,\" the observation that a country can choose no more than two of the following three features of its policy regime: (NUM) free capital mobility across borders, (NUM) a fixed exchange rate, and (NUM) an independent monetary policy.NUM Various combinations of these features have dominated world monetary arrangements in different eras. Under the classical gold standard of DATE, the major trading countries chose the benefits of free capital flows and the perceived stability of a fixed relation of their currency to gold; of necessity, then, they largely abjured independent monetary policies. Under the Bretton Woods system created at the end of World War II, many countries renounced capital mobility in an attempt to maintain both fixed exchange rates and monetary independence. Currently, among the major industrial regions at least, we have collectively chosen a regime that gives up fixed exchange rates in favor of the other two elements. Is the international monetary regime that is in place DATE the best one for the world? For the economically advanced nations that use the world's three key currencies - the euro, the yen, and the dollar - I believe that the benefits of independent monetary policies and capital mobility greatly exceed whatever costs may result from a regime of floating exchange rates. My view is widely - though not universally - shared among economists and policymakers. In particular, what was once viewed as the principal objection to floating exchange rates, that their adoption would leave the system bereft of a nominal anchor, has proven to be unfounded. Most countries DATE, including many emerging-market and developing nations as well as the advanced industrial countries, have succeeded in establishing a commitment to keeping domestic inflation low and stable, a commitment that has served effectively as a nominal anchor. A newer critique of floating exchange rates contends that exchange rates are more volatile than can be explained by the macroeconomic fundamentals and, moreover, that this excess volatility has in some cases inhibited international trade (Flood and Rose, DATE; Rose, DATE; Klein and Shambaugh, DATE). Like other asset prices, floating exchange rates do indeed exhibit a great deal of volatility in the very short term, responding to many types of economic news and, sometimes it seems, to no news at all. Whether this very short-term volatility is excessive relative to fundamentals (which are inherently difficult to observe and measure) is debatable. In any case, this short-term volatility seems unlikely to have substantial effects on trade or capital flows, as short-term fluctuations in exchange rates are easily hedged. Exchange rates also exhibit long-horizon volatility, of course; but, although the swings in the exchange value of the dollar over DATE have been large, so have been the changes in the global macroeconomic environment. As key components of the international adjustment mechanism, fluctuations in exchange rates and the associated financial flows have often played an important stabilizing role. For example, the sharp rise in the dollar in DATE reflected to an important degree a surge in U.S. productivity growth, which raised perceived rates of return and attracted significant inflows of capital. The capital inflows, the stronger dollar, and the associated rise in imports worked together to permit increased capital investment in the United States during that period, enabling production and incomes to grow without overheating the economy or requiring a sustained rise in interest rates. The value of floating exchange rates as shock absorbers might make their adoption worthwhile even if their volatility did have a chilling effect on trade. However, the sharp rise in trade volumes relative to world gross domestic product in DATE suggests to me that, at least for the world as a whole, any such chilling effect has likely been minor. The presumption in favor of allowing the market to determine the exchange rates among the major currencies is strengthened by the fact that a consensus about the appropriate levels at which to peg these currencies would be difficult to obtain. A poor choice of the rates at which currencies would trade could condemn one or more regions to unwanted inflation and the other regions to economic stagnation for a transition period that could easily DATE. The United Kingdom suffered the consequences of a poor choice of peg when it returned to the gold standard after World War I, as an overvalued pound reduced British exports and significantly worsened the country's unemployment problem. The United Kingdom faced analogous problems DATE, when it entered the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in DATE at a parity that again disadvantaged British exports and contributed to Great Britain's worst recession in DATE. Nor were these macroeconomic costs compensated for by greater external stability; in both episodes, doubts about the sustainability of the peg generated speculative attacks that ultimately forced the pound off its fixed rate. Overall, the case for floating exchange rates among the United States, Japan, and the euro zone seems to me to be compelling. For smaller industrial countries, the case for floating rates may in some instances be less clear-cut, for example, when the bulk of a country's trade is with a single, large trading partner. Generally, though, my sense is that the benefits of floating exchange rates exceed the costs for these countries as well. Much more controversial is the question of how developing and emerging-market countries should resolve the trilemma. Some might argue against these countries' choosing to allow free capital mobility on the grounds that rapid reversals in international capital flows have induced balance of payments crises and difficult domestic adjustments for them in the past. But even those most concerned about potential instability in international capital flows would have to admit that comprehensive capital controls, if applied for any extended period, might solve one problem at the cost of creating a more serious one - namely, the inhibition of growth and development that occurs when nations lack access to international capital markets. At best, then, restrictions on capital mobility should be viewed as a temporary expedient, a second-best or third-best solution to the problems presented by flawed or immature institutions in a nation at early or intermediate stages of development. In the medium run, the better approach - admittedly, one not always so easy to implement - is to commit to making the nation's legal, regulatory, and fiscal framework stronger and more transparent. If foreign investors are thus reassured that their capital will be employed efficiently and its returns repatriated smoothly, the risks of capital flow reversals under a regime of free capital mobility should be much reduced. If we agree that every country should set a goal of achieving at least some degree of capital mobility, then the trilemma for developing countries ultimately boils down to the choice between flexible exchange rates (and the associated independence of monetary policy) and fixed rates (which do not allow monetary independence). For the remainder of my remarks I will focus on that choice. I should acknowledge immediately that to state the choice as one of \"fixed versus floating\" is to oversimplify. Both types of regime are actually broad categories, each of which contains a number of variants. Fixed exchange rates are almost never irrevocably fixed, for example: Crawling pegs allow the rate to be adjusted in a controlled manner, while some putatively fixed rates are actually re-set at frequent intervals, either as an instrument of policy or under external pressure. So-called hard pegs, including currency boards and dollarization, may draw credibility from various institutional impediments to changing the rate; but even full dollarization can be reversed, as Liberia proved in NUM Floating exchange rates cover an even wider range of policy behavior than fixed rates - from full reliance on the foreign exchange market for the determination of the exchange rate to a carefully managed float. So what should developing countries do about the exchange rate? Theory suggests that any group of countries whose economic structures and trade linkages satisfy the requirements of an optimum currency area, in the sense of Mundell (DATE), would be well served by fixing the exchange rates among their currencies or, even better, by forming a currency union.NUM However, in practice, empirical analyses have generally been unsuccessful at identifying multi-country regions of any size that meet the criteria for an optimum currency area. Indeed, some studies have concluded that even the United States and the European Union, the largest currency unions, are themselves not optimum currency areas.NUM Plausibly, political rather than economic considerations - namely, the desire to form a more NUM perfect union - underlay the decisions of each of these entities to adopt a common currency.NUM, Besides countries well-suited for a currency union, a second group of countries that might conceivably be better off with a fixed exchange rate, at least for a time, are the very poorest and least developed countries, which may lack the institutional infrastructure to effectively operate an independent monetary policy. In these countries, a hard peg or even the adoption of the currency of a major trading partner - sometimes known as dollarization, although the term also refers to cases in which the currency adopted is one other than the dollar - may be policy options worth considering. (I want to be clear that I am speaking generally and am not advocating that other countries adopt the U.S. currency.) Although dollarization has the advantage of making monetary policy essentially automatic and should be an effective device for controlling inflation, one is struck by the fact that so few countries have chosen this approach. Costs of dollarization include the loss of revenue from money creation and the reduced ability of the central bank to serve as a lender of last resort. But perhaps the most important impediment to dollarization is that, in giving up their own currency, the country's citizens may feel that they are losing an important symbol of the nation's sovereignty and pride. For other developing and emerging-market countries, I would argue that the best course is generally to let the exchange rate float freely and to make low and stable inflation a principal focus of monetary policy. As I have already suggested, this approach makes the targeted inflation rate, and not the exchange rate or some other variable, the nominal anchor of the system. An important reason for making the inflation rate (more precisely, the price level) the nominal anchor is that the general price level is more directly linked to economic welfare than is the exchange rate. Domestic price stability improves the operation of markets, reduces the costs associated with economizing on money holdings and with changing prices, lessens distortions associated with imperfect indexing of the tax system and the accounting system, and aids long-term planning. As I have also already noted, concerns about the feasibility of this approach have been put to rest by the experience of DATE or so. Central banks in many countries, with either an explicit or an implicit inflation target, have demonstrated the capacity to keep inflation low and stable. Indeed, recent research suggests that the combination of an inflation target, central bank independence, and a market-determined exchange rate tends to reduce variability in both inflation and output, even in small open economies such as Finland and NUM When the parity is nominally fixed but can be varied, and if capital flows are less than perfectly free, monetary policy under a fixed exchange rate may have a degree of independence; thus, the resolution of the trilemma may not be a stark choice of two of the three elements but a partial adoption of each. NUM An optimum currency area is a region in which labor and capital are internally mobile and sub-regions tend to be affected by similar shocks. As Mundell (DATE) first argued, in this situation the shock-absorbing benefits of flexible exchange rates are outweighed by the reduction in transactions costs and in uncertainty provided by fixed exchange rates or a common currency. NUM See, for example, Bayoumi and Eichengreen (DATE) and Ghosh and Wolf (DATE). NUM European economic integration has been motivated to a significant degree by a desire to make a repeat of the destructive conflicts of DATE impossible. In the fledgling United States, the desire to strengthen the central government was a principal reason behind Alexander Hamilton's advocacy of a common currency and common national debt. NUM On the other hand, recent research has pointed out the interesting possibility that the formation of a currency union, by promoting trade and economic integration among its members, may lead the criteria for an optimum currency area among the participating countries to be satisfied after the fact even if not before (Frankel and Rose, DATE). Of course, to justify a currency union on this basis requires the ability to forecast how linkages among the participants will evolve under the common currency, a difficult undertaking indeed. BIS Review NUM/DATE New Zealand (Truman, DATE). To be clear, a focus on domestic inflation does not imply that policymakers must entirely ignore the exchange rate; particularly in small open economies, stabilization of the domestic price level may entail some \"leaning against the wind\" with respect to exchange rate movements, because of their influence on domestic prices. This behavior does not imply that exchange rate stabilization is an independent objective, however; and should price stability and exchange rate stability come into conflict, it is the latter that should be jettisoned. In contrast to floating rates, fixed exchange rates - rather than being a mechanism for reducing macroeconomic instability - have often been a source of instability. Historically, governments have often defended their fixed parity even after the overvaluation of the exchange rate became obvious, leading to losses of foreign exchange reserves, a balance of payments crisis, and difficult domestic adjustments. Some observers have suggested that the solution to this problem is to tie the government's hands even more forcefully by imposing a harder peg, by means of a currency board or dollarization for example. But market participants know that promises to maintain a fixed rate are almost never irrevocable, and so a speculative attack is always possible (as Argentina recently learned, for example). Another strategy for deterring speculative attacks on a fixed exchange rate is to build a \"war chest\" of foreign-currency reserves. To be effective in DATE's world of highly mobile capital, the war chest may have to be sizable indeed; and for countries with large government debts and high domestic interest rates, holding great quantities of low-yielding reserves can have serious fiscal consequences. In any case, strategies to increase the defensibility of the peg ignore the broader issue of the role of the exchange rate in macroeconomic adjustment. For an individual country, forcing adjustment to a mis-valued exchange rate through domestic price changes is likely to be far more difficult and costly than an adjustment occurring through exchange rate depreciation or appreciation. For the world as a whole, macroeconomic adjustment may likewise be impeded if economically important countries attempt to maintain pegs at levels that differ from those dictated by fundamentals. If fixed exchange rates bear such risks, what explains their continued existence? One traditional argument in favor of fixed exchange rates for developing countries focuses on their usefulness in so-called heterodox programs for overcoming high inflation.NUM According to this view, the advantage of fixing the exchange rate as one element of an anti-inflation program (along with fiscal reforms and other policy changes) is that fixing the rate is more visible, more credible, and easier to explain than a commitment to stabilizing prices directly. Even if we grant a role for a fixed exchange rate in combating high inflation, however, this argument provides no rationale for fixing the rate indefinitely. If the program is successful and the inflationary psychology is broken, nothing prevents a transition from targeting the exchange rate to targeting inflation. Two countries with chronic inflation problems, Argentina and Brazil, did not experience a sustained resurgence of high inflation when they abandoned fixed rates in DATE. Brazil now targets inflation, and by some reports Argentina has considered the option. Israel broke the back of its hyperinflation in DATE with the aid of a fixed exchange rate but then made a gradual and successful transition to inflation targeting. And, of course, this argument provides no rationale for the use of fixed exchange rates by countries, such as the East Asian emerging-market countries, that have not experienced episodes of high inflation. An interesting recent explanation for the continued existence of fixed exchange rates is the so-called fear-of-floating phenomenon (Calvo and Reinhart, DATE). According to this view, the poor credibility of policymakers in some countries implies that the exchange rate, if left unmanaged, would prove excessively volatile. High exchange rate volatility could prove very harmful in these countries, for at least two reasons. First, the openness of these economies to trade, coupled with the fact that the exchange rate may serve as a focal point for inflation expectations, may imply that exchange rate volatility translates quickly into instability in consumer prices. Second, because firms and households in these countries often borrow in foreign currencies but receive revenues and incomes in the domestic currency, swings in the exchange rate have major effects on the net worth of these borrowers. In particular, a sharp devaluation, by raising the value of foreign liabilities relative to domestic assets, might bankrupt large segments of the economy, with severe financial and economic implications. According to the fear-of-floating hypothesis, the severe consequences of exchange rate volatility in these countries may lead policymakers to manage their currencies quite closely to damp volatility, no matter what the putative exchange rate regime. If we assume that the fear-of-floating hypothesis accurately describes behavior, what are the implications? Some have argued that, given the unwillingness to float, countries would be better off dollarizing or taking other measures to achieve a hard peg. This approach would have the benefits (the argument goes) of making explicit the country's implicit policy, making a disruptive devaluation less likely, and consequently, possibly reducing the risk premium that borrowers in the country must pay to borrow abroad. I have already expressed reservations about so-called hard pegs for developing countries: Though less so than conventional pegs, they remain subject to speculative attacks, and they may make domestic macroeconomic adjustment more difficult. They also constrain the central bank's ability to act as a lender of last resort in the event of a banking crisis. Moreover, the small amount of available evidence does not favor the view that a hard peg will significantly reduce the risk premium a country must pay on international loans; for example, the dollarized nations of El Salvador and Panama do not appear to be paying lower interest rate premiums on their debt than other similarly situated countries. Furthermore, to the extent that a hard peg encourages foreign-currency borrowing, the costs of devaluation, should it come, may be greatly increased. One may also question whether the fear of floating is a permanent and irremediable condition. An important underpinning of the fear-of-floating argument is the idea that borrowing and lending in international capital markets must take place only in a few key currencies, condemning most countries to borrow in a currency other than their own and exposing them to heavy losses in the event of a devaluation (Eichengreen and Hausman, DATE). In addition, because of creditor mistrust, the borrowing that does take place must be mostly in short-maturity instruments, greatly increasing the risk of a liquidity crisis. Continuing the tradition of colorful nomenclature in international economics, this hypothesis has been labeled \"original sin,\" because the need to borrow in foreign currencies and in short-maturity instruments supposedly constrains all but the largest and wealthiest countries regardless of economic policies and performance. However, recent developments in international capital markets challenge the inevitability of \"original sin\" (Eichengreen, Hausman, and Panizza, DATE; Burger and Warnock, DATE). First, some small countries have in fact been able to sell domestic-currency debt to foreigners (examples include New Zealand, Poland, and South Africa). Second, some developing countries have been able to establish active domestic credit markets in which borrowing may take place in long-term, fixed-rate debt, providing a partial substitute for foreigncurrency borrowing (examples include Chile, India, and Korea). In both situations, the quality of the country's macroeconomic policies as well as the strength and transparency of its institutional framework have been critically important for improving the access of borrowers to capital. Redemption from \"original sin\" through good works may thus be possible. These experiences suggest that, whatever interim arrangements they adopt regarding exchange rates and capital mobility, developing countries would do well to shift their focus to the task of building institutions, protecting property rights, and establishing a sound fiscal and monetary framework, with the ultimate goal of making free capital flows and a floating exchange rate feasible. In the wake of the Asian crisis, the conventional wisdom asserted that a country should eschew fixed exchange rates in favor of either of the two extremes: a floating rate or a currency union. I agree with this \"bipolar view\" insofar as I think that a garden-variety fixed exchange rate is, in most instances, the worst of all worlds. Notably, fixed exchange rates often result in irresistible one-way bets for speculators, with crisis and painful economic adjustment the likely result. Large holdings of foreign exchange reserves reduce this risk but create other costs. Currency unions are considerably less prone to speculative attack and may reduce uncertainty and transactions costs in international trade and finance. But as I have indicated DATE, I believe that floating exchange rates are generally to be preferred either to fixed exchange rates or - except in those relatively rare cases in which the criteria for an optimum currency area are met - to currency unions. This view seems to be spreading. According to the International Monetary Fund (DATE), for example, inflation-targeting countries are becoming more numerous as countries that fix the exchange rate become fewer.NUM Consistent with this observation, average inflation rates in both industrial and developing countries are near their lowest levels in DATE, reflecting the new emphasis in policy. Politicians and policymakers around the world are being converted to the idea that monetary policy should focus on delivering low and stable inflation, with the determination of exchange rates left to free markets. The most consequential exception to the general trend toward inflation stabilization, free capital markets, and floating exchange rates is, of course, China. China currently has relatively strict - though not absolutely impermeable - barriers to capital flows, as well as an exchange rate that is effectively pegged to the U.S. dollar. The governments of the United States and the other G-NUM countries have urged China to make the transition to a market-determined exchange rate, in the interest of promoting global macroeconomic adjustment. I will add here only that moving toward exchange rate flexibility is in the interest of China as well as the rest of the world. As a large, increasingly wealthy, and increasingly market-oriented economy, China will benefit from the shock-absorber properties of an independent monetary policy and a floating exchange rate. Because it needs capital to fuel its rapid growth and because its citizens would benefit greatly from the opportunity to invest their own savings abroad, China will likewise benefit from increased capital freedom. Finally, the institutional developments needed to support ever-more-open capital markets, including a strengthened legal and regulatory framework, an increased capacity of its banks to allocate capital to the most productive uses, and a reduced role of the government in investment decisions, are themselves necessary and important steps in China's economic modernization. The United States will also benefit as China and other East Asian countries make the transition to floating exchange rates and freer capital flows. More-open capital accounts and market-determined exchange rates will likely engender greater stability and improved resource allocation in Asia, setting the stage for sustained future growth. The development of the Asian economies will expand export markets for U.S. producers, particularly as independent monetary policies and institutional reform provide scope for stimulating demand by Asian households and firms. Some observers have expressed concern about the effects of reduced reserve accumulation by Asian central banks on U.S. bond markets; however, the U.S. bond market is extremely deep and has shown a remarkable capacity to handle transitions smoothly, particularly when they occur in a gradual and predictable manner. Moreover, under a regime of free capital mobility, private savers in China and the rest of East Asia may well wish to diversify into U.S. assets, including U.S. bonds. In summary, I have argued DATE for an international system based on the principles of flexible exchange rates, free capital mobility, and independent monetary policies, at least within the great majority of countries. Important complementary elements include free trade (though I have not discussed it DATE) and the further development of the \"soft\" infrastructure - the legal, regulatory, fiscal, and financial frameworks that characterize advanced economies.

                  "Randall S Kroszner: International capital flows and the emerging market economies Remarks by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Central Bank of Argentina Seminar, Central Bank of Argentina, Buenos Aires, DATE.    I am delighted to be here in Buenos Aires at a sister central bank, the Banco Central de la República Argentina.NUM The topic of my discussion DATE - international capital flows - is sure to be of interest to any student of Argentina's economic history. As in all countries, the evolution of the Argentine economy has been conditioned fundamentally by the nation's own framework of laws, policies, and social practices. Nevertheless, the progression of economic developments in Argentina has always been intertwined with developments in global capital markets, and that connection will likely persist as Argentina continues to open up to the world economy. I will start by identifying three interrelated aspects of international capital flows in DATE's global economy. First, the scale of gross capital flows throughout the world is expanding, reflecting financial innovation, lowered barriers to capital movements, and a decline in what economists refer to as \"home bias.\" Second, increased capital mobility is making it possible to finance ever larger current account deficits, and, indeed, these deficits have grown in DATE relative to the size of the global economy. Finally, in the aggregate, we see that capital has been flowing, on net, from emergingmarket economies to industrial countries in DATE, the reverse of the pattern in previous decades.NUM I would like to focus on the last of these features - the flow of capital between developing and industrial countries. We will see that the aggregate data obscure important features of the flow of capital between the two global regions. After discussing various explanations for the net flow of capital to industrial countries, I will address the steps that emerging-market economies can take to enhance their prospects for capital formation and financial investment. I will also touch on changes in emergingmarket financing and how this has altered the distribution of risks in the global financial system. Please note that the opinions I'll be expressing DATE are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. The scale and composition of capital flows Let's begin by getting some sense of the size, source, and composition of the net capital flows that are moving from developing to industrial countries. One reasonable measure of the size of these flows is the combined current account balance of the developing economies. According to estimates by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the developing economies as a group had a current account surplus of $NUM billion DATE (IMF, DATEa).NUM Because the financial counterpart to this surplus is a deficit on the financial accounts, it represents the net capital outflow to the industrial economies. $NUM billion is a big number and stands in sharp contrast to the situation preceding the Asia crisis. For example, in DATE the combined current account balance of the developing economies was a deficit of $NUM billion, representing a capital inflow of that amount from the industrial world. The sources of the $NUM billion in net capital flow out of the developing economies are remarkably concentrated. Of those developing economies running current account surpluses, a mere seventeen of them - China, four other Asian economies, Russia, and eleven members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries - accounted for a combined surplus of $NUM billion. And about half of that was generated by the major oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and by Russia, whose surpluses ballooned in DATE as oil prices soared. Thus, the other NUM developing economies in our data had a combined current account deficit, or net capital inflow, of $NUM billion. This is not to say that things have not changed for these NUM countries in DATE: In DATE, their combined current account deficit was twice as large as it was DATE. That's the big picture in terms of the size and country source of DATE's net capital flows. Let's dig a little deeper and take a look at the gross capital inflows and outflows that constitute these net figures. Unfortunately, the information on gross capital flows is not as timely as that for the current account, and the data sets are not as consistent as we might like. Nonetheless, the estimates we have are informative and, again, a bit surprising. For example, for DATE, DATE for which we have reasonably complete data, the developing economies as a group reported a gross capital inflow of $NUM billion, more than double the inflow recorded for DATE (IMF, DATE). So how did we end up with a switch to net outflows? In DATE, gross capital outflows from the developing economies totaled almost $NUM trillion - more than a tripling of the DATE figure. Thus, we see that the question we have to answer is not, \"Why has capital stopped flowing from the industrial countries to the developing economies?\" In gross terms it has not stopped; in fact, the flow has accelerated! The question instead is, \"Why are the developing economies investing so much in the industrial countries?\" In a moment I will turn to several explanations for the recent pattern of capital flows. Before doing that, however, we should take one additional insight from the gross figures: Of the gross capital outflow from the developing economies in DATE, fully half reflects the further accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by the official sector. To be sure, a large part of this reserve accumulation was by the seventeen economies singled out earlier as large capital exporters (IMF, DATE). But the other NUM economies also recorded substantial reserve accumulations. Once we put aside these official reserve flows, it turns out that, in DATE, private capital flowed, on net, from the industrial economies to the developing economies. Why is capital flowing uphill? Why does it matter? Recognizing that the aggregate data lump together the very different circumstances of different economies, it is still true that, on the whole, net capital is flowing from the developing to the industrial world. Economists sometimes refer to this phenomenon as capital flowing \"uphill\" because it appears to contradict economic logic (See Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian, DATE). There are two elements of that logic. First, in developing economies, labor is generally much more available than capital; accordingly, capital should in principle be more productive in these economies and should thus flow there from the relatively labor-scarce industrial countries. Second, the relatively rapid income growth expected by developing economies as they catch up to industrial countries should provide them with incentives to borrow against their expected higher future incomes. These considerations lead economists to puzzle over both the net outflow of capital from the developing economies and its implications for the global economy. One approach to explaining the uphill flow of capital focuses on divergent patterns of growth and investment. According to one such view, the rise in U.S. productivity growth since DATE boosted perceived rates of return on U.S. assets and thus attracted capital; expectations of higher rates of return and higher incomes likely boosted U.S. investment and consumption spending as well (Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust, DATE; Ferguson, DATE). A complementary explanation, labeled the \"global saving glut\" by Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke DATE, argues that during DATE, declines in investment spending outside the United States - in part because of emergingmarket crises - led to a surplus of saving over investment abroad that was channeled toward the U.S. economy (Bernanke, DATE; Gruber and Kamin, forthcoming). The global saving glut argument suggests that developing economies have benefited from the recent pattern of global capital flows, gaining both demand for their products and a safe return on their assets at a time when an investment slump threatened to depress domestic activity and rates of return. The implications of the U.S. productivity story are a little harder to read, but developing economies, especially in Asia, likely have benefited from the expansion of investment and production opportunities created by the revolution in information technology. Neither the global saving glut nor the U.S. advantage in productivity growth, however, can be expected to persist indefinitely. How long the differences will persist depends upon a number of factors. In rapidly developing countries that have had high savings rates such as China, for example, consumption demand is likely to increase as they grow wealthier, thereby reducing their savings rates. Concerning productivity differences, it may require more than simply the diffusion and adoption of information technology around the globe. As I will come back to later, flexible labor, product, and financial markets appear to be crucial to reaping the full benefits of the information technology revolution, so national policy choices will play an important role in maintaining or closing productivity differences. In any event, this set of explanations for the uphill flow of capital suggests that it would be likely and desirable for net capital flows to reverse direction and head back toward the developing economies at some point. A second - but not mutually exclusive - set of explanations for this phenomenon focuses on what might be more-persistent, structural differences between developing and industrial economies. The financial systems in many developing nations are relatively weak and are not effective at directing saving toward appropriate investment projects. That failing leads to inadequate investment, particularly if business activity is further impeded by inadequate property rights and faulty regulations. As a result, excess saving flows to countries with better financial systems (Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian, DATE; Ju and Wei, DATE). A closely related point is that, compared with developing economies, industrial countries are believed to produce financial assets that are safer, less volatile, and more liquid, advantages that also draw capital out of developing economies (Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas, DATE; Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull, DATE). These considerations suggest that the current pattern of international capital flows represents a win-win scenario: Developing economies gain access to better financial services, and industrial economies enjoy the larger quantities of imports they can purchase with this financing. These explanations also suggest that the uphill flow of capital will be reversed to the extent that financial systems of emerging-market economies develop and improve. Because such a process is likely to take time, this set of explanations suggests that the uphill flow of capital is likely to persist for a while. A third set of explanations traces the emergence of current account deficits in the industrial countries, especially the United States, to increases in both public and private consumption which show up as declines in national savings rates.NUM Some observers draw a less sanguine message from this approach than the first two mentioned above, namely, that current increases in consumption in the industrial economies could potentially cost them greater indebtedness and lower future consumption, and developing economies might then have less investment than otherwise. The high level of gross flows into emerging markets and the \"downhill\" flow of private capital to some extent temper this interpretation. The three sets of explanations I have just discussed are only some of the many stories that have been offered to explain the uphill flow of capital, and none of them have gained wide acceptance as the best. Elements of each of them could account for some aspects of the current state of global capital flows, and none are complete explanations for this complex phenomenon. For example, concerning structural differences, as I discussed earlier, the aggregate current account balance of the developing economies turned to surplus only in DATE; before then, it was in deficit, even though the financial sectors in those economies were, if anything, even less mature than they are DATE. That said, the financial-sector stories as well as the productivity stories I've reviewed probably are at least part of the explanation for the global pattern of capital flows. Moreover, these stories help to identify policies that developing economies can undertake to boost domestic capital formation and enhance the attractiveness of financial assets, both for foreign and domestic investors. Such policies lay the foundation for future economic growth as well as promise to alter the current pattern of capital flows and external balances. Making emerging-market economies a more attractive place to invest Businesses in many emerging-market economies face a multitude of hurdles. Red tape, rigid regulations, and weak legal systems impede the formation of businesses, their ongoing operation, and their confidence in having their contracts enforced without long and costly litigation. Accordingly, governments in these countries could greatly improve the environment for domestic capital formation by simplifying business regulations, strengthening property rights, including the rights of creditors, and improving contract enforcement (Kroszner DATE and DATEb; Mishkin, DATE). These kinds of institutional improvements would also help ensure that capital inflows are channeled in a growthenhancing manner (Arteta, Eichengreen, and Wyplosz, DATE). As noted above, I believe it will take more than simply investment in information technology (IT) for a country to enjoy the large productivity enhancements that can be brought about by the IT revolution (Kroszner DATE and DATEb). The IT revolution has not simply allowed a worker to turn the crank faster on an improved machine (the traditional way we think of technological innovation) but opened the possibility of fundamentally altering the way production (or provision of a service) takes place. In this way, IT can contribute larger productivity improvements when an economy has flexible labor, product, and financial markets. To provide the greatest incentive for investment in the context of the IT revolution, business must operate in an environment that will permit them to transform themselves in ways that allow technologyintensive investment to have the highest possible effect on productivity growth. Similarly, labor markets must be flexible enough to allow for the prompt re-allocation of resources in response to changes in demand. The economy also must be competitive enough to allow useful innovations at some firms to be transmitted throughout the industry by market pressure. This underscores the importance of the overall regulatory and property rights environment to fostering investment necessary for productivity growth in emerging economies. More generally, a related set of policies should focus on strengthening the financial system so that it better channels domestic saving into appropriate domestic investment projects. Adopting international best practices in financial supervision and regulation would help promote prudent risk management and effective intermediation. Intermediation could also be enhanced by developing capital markets outside the banking system. The creation of secondary markets for mortgage debt and, as I will describe in more detail shortly, the development of local bond markets more generally has promoted deeper and more liquid financial systems in some emerging markets. Installing modern trading and electronic payment systems, which facilitate quick and easy allocation of capital, would also help. A simple, intuitive principle governs all efforts to develop markets that channel funds efficiently from a large number investors (both domestic and foreign). The principle is that all investors must believe they all have the same access to information about investments and that they all will be treated in the same way. To this end, policies to increase transparency, disclosure, and restrictions on insider advantages are critical (Gelos and Wei, DATE; Ahearne and others, DATE). Finally, prudent macroeconomic policies - fiscal consolidation and monetary policies aimed at price stability - are crucial to any effort to boost investment and attract financing (Kroszner DATE and DATEb). Emerging-market financing and the distribution of risks Emerging-market economies have, to varying degrees, already made progress in improving their financial environment over DATE. Inflation has been substantially reduced, and fiscal balances have been brought under control. Many countries have reformed their financial systems and modernized their business regulations. These policies have helped attract private capital inflows, even though total capital flows still move from developing to industrial economies on net. Financing mechanisms in the emerging-market economies have also evolved. Most notably, external borrowing increasingly is in the form of bonds denominated in domestic currency, often issued at fixed interest rates, and dated for long maturities, in contrast to the foreign-currency instruments that dominated external borrowing in DATE. Government bonds of this new type were first issued by Korea and Thailand in DATE; Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Russia soon followed suit (Kroszner, DATEa). These new instruments have helped establish long-dated benchmark yield curves and thus encourage corporate bond issuance and mortgage lending in domestic currency and at longer maturities. The new instruments are also changing the distribution of risk. When entities in the emerging markets borrowed in foreign currencies, they bore the exchange rate risk while lenders bore default risk. This arrangement made the financial crises of DATE very costly: Sharp currency depreciations caused the domestic-currency value of foreign-currency debt to balloon. With domestic-currency financing, lenders now bear most of the exchange rate risk. And with fixedrate bonds, the interest rate risk, too, is being shifted to the lenders. We would expect that emergingmarket borrowers would have to pay higher yields to compensate lenders for this additional risk. But yields on the new instruments have generally been moving down. For example, Mexico, even with its history of macroeconomic instability, can borrow in pesos at a DATE maturity at roughly NUM percent. These low yields are part of a more general decline in compensation for risk in emerging markets, a trend also evidenced by low risk spreads on dollar-denominated bonds and rising stock prices. In part, this trend reflects the low volatility in international financial markets in DATE. However, it also reflects improvements in the economic policies and debt positions of emerging-market economies. In the past, an environment of low risk spreads contributed to overborrowing, booms, and then busts. So far, that cycle has not developed, and it is crucial that sound and prudent policies continue to guard against it's doing so. Credible macroeconomic and financial policies in the emerging-market economies provide double benefits: They help keep borrowing costs low, and, in the event of a future retreat from risk by global investors, they will help the affected economies weather any ensuing financial turbulence. Conclusion In conclusion, I believe that the current net flow of capital toward the industrial world is not in the longterm interest of the developing economies. To raise incomes and reduce poverty, the developing economies must boost their productivity, and that, in turn, will require complementing their large and growing labor forces with increasing quantities of capital. I would add that the current pattern of net capital flows is more the deviation than the norm. The developing economies in the aggregate swung into current account surplus only in DATE. Moreover, at present, only a subset of developing economies account for those surpluses, and even those are enjoying substantial gross capital inflows. Of course, there are better ways and worse ways to achieve a reversal in net capital flows. In the past, current account deficits in the emerging-market economies were frequently the outcome of large budget deficits and inappropriate exchange rate regimes, and I am certainly not calling for a return to such policies. Rather, a swing in net capital flows back toward the developing economies would best be achieved through policies they need - regardless of their effect on external balances - to promote capital formation and economic growth. Such policies would improve the environment for business investment, strengthen domestic financial systems, and encourage the development of more-attractive financial instruments. In particular, an increase in transparency and disclosure is important so that all investors believe they will be treated equally and have an equal chance to enjoy the returns from their investments. These steps, against the background of prudent monetary and fiscal policies, will help both to encourage capital inflows and to ensure that they are used to best advantage. By the same token, industrial countries can undertake policies to enhance their prospects for solid, sustainable growth that would also have the effect of altering the current pattern of international capital flows. In the United States, it is crucial to address the implications of demographic changes for the longer-term path of entitlement spending. Other industrial economies also face this challenge. To a certain extent, financial and economic reforms are already under way in many emerging-market economies, and private capital flows to these countries have expanded sharply over DATE. Moreover, financial flows increasingly are in the form of fixed-rate domestic-currency bonds, which makes emerging-market borrowers less vulnerable to precipitous movements in exchange rates and other asset prices. Financial crises may materialize and disrupt economic activity, as they have in the past. However, provided that emerging-market economies continue to pursue structural reforms and stabilizing macroeconomic policies, their prospects for solid economic growth and resilience in the face of crisis will improve.

                  "Timothy F Geithner: Reflections on the changing global economy Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the 46th ACI Financial Markets Association World Congress, Montreal, Quebec, DATE.    Good morning. I am pleased to be able to join you DATE. And it is a privilege to be here DATE with Canada's accomplished central bank governor, David Dodge. There are few people in central banks or in governments around the world DATE that have presided over as far reaching and successful a set of macroeconomic policy reforms as has David Dodge. I want to offer some reflections about the challenges managing macroeconomic policy in a more open and integrated world economy. And I want to say something about how the international monetary system, and the current framework of exchange rate regimes, might develop in DATE. For DATE or more, choices about exchange rate regimes have played an important role in economic outcomes across countries. From the Gold Standard of DATE DATE through the Bretton Woods system and the episodes of exchange rate cooperation among the G5 and the G7 in DATE and after, the desire to achieve exchange rate stability was a major preoccupation of policymakers. The economic damage inflicted by the disastrous competitive devaluations among the major economies in DATE had a profound influence on thinking during much of the postwar period. And for governments and enterprises around the world DATE, the aversion to large fluctuations in exchange rates remains strong. As the world has become more open to trade and more closely integrated, this sensitivity to exchange rate variability has intensified. And yet, experience suggests that resisting variability makes the adjustment to changing economic conditions more painful. In an increasingly open world economy, the ability to cope with change becomes more important, and for a large fraction of the world economic, exchange rate flexibility is a necessary condition for sustained favorable economic performance. Changes in fundamental factors such as productivity growth and the inevitable shocks to demand and supply require changes in relative prices, both domestically and internationally. A flexible exchange rate regime makes it easier for relative prices to move rapidly and effectively in the appropriate direction, and this generally eases the cost of that adjustment. Even in a fixed rate regime, this adjustment in response to changing circumstances will ultimately have to take place, of course. But if relative prices cannot adjust through the exchange rate, domestic output and employment will have to bear the brunt of adjustment instead. Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, we have seen the emergence of a diverse range of exchange rate arrangements. The large industrial economies have, by and large, decided to let their currencies adjust to changing circumstances without official intervention in exchange markets. Japan aside, it is now DATE since the last episode of concerted intervention among the major economies; and there has been no Japanese intervention for DATE. Among emerging economies, too, we have seen a marked trend toward more flexible exchange rate regimes. This is particularly pronounced in parts of Latin America. At the other end of the spectrum, some of the newer members of the European Union are gearing up to adopt the euro. Somewhere in the middle between these extremes of flexible exchange rate regimes and full monetary integration are the emerging market economies, mostly in Asia and among the major oil exporters in the Gulf, that still sustain fixed or partially fixed exchange rate regimes. Most of these countries link their currencies to the dollar, though we see varying degrees of flexibility in the closeness of that link. How has the world fared under this diverse mixed of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes? In general, I think, the costs of living with exchange rate volatility have been less than feared and attempts to limit volatility have been more damaging and less effective than expected. Take the experience of the major economies. Despite periods of very substantial swings in exchange rates, and the amplitude of the changes in exchange rates among the major currencies since DATE have been exceptionally large, economic growth in the major economies have become more stable, not less. Quarterly GDP volatility in the United States, for example, has fallen by more than half since DATE. And average rates of inflation and the variability of inflation outcomes have of course declined substantially as well. This is not to say that these swings in exchange rates have not come with pain and trauma, only that overall economic performance has fared better than many would have expected DATE when contemplating life under flexible exchange rates. Among emerging markets, experience with exchange rate flexibility has been more limited, and the record has been more mixed. Chile probably has one of the longest record of successful performance under a flexible regime, success due in large part of course to a strong record of prudent macroeconomic policy management and strong institutions. But there are many more examples DATE - Brazil and Mexico are two - of emerging economies with sustained periods of improved growth and inflation outcomes under more flexible exchange rate regimes. Emerging market economies face substantially greater challenges than the less open major economies in adjusting to a more integrated world and to the greater exposure to real and financial volatility that comes with integration. Large movements in capital flows can complicate the task of achieving sustainable growth, low inflation and financial stability. This is obvious for those countries experiencing sharp net outflows of capital, but the challenges are formidable even for those countries experiencing sustained periods of large inflows. And even those countries with more flexible exchange rates can see competitiveness eroded if their major trading partners resist exchange rate appreciation. For most countries, though, these challenges would be exacerbated rather than eased by a policy designed to try to sustain a fixed rate or to narrowly constrain variability in the exchange rate. Although it may seem counterintuitive, small open economies, even more than larger less open economies, need the flexibility that floating exchange rates bring. Changes in exchange rate regimes were present at the scene of most of the major emerging market financial crises of DATE, and many have argued that the decisions to let the exchange rate adjust was a major source of the trauma that followed. But that's not a fair reading of the evidence. In general, the crises were the consequence of fundamental economic problems, often manifested in the buildup of substantial balance sheet problems, with excessive borrowing in foreign currency by the sovereign, the banking system, or both. These balance sheet problems were one reason many governments chose to postpone currency adjustment for as long as possible, and these delays ensured that the cost of adjustment, when it was forced on these governments, was far higher than if action had been taken earlier. But this is not the whole story since the fixed exchange rate regime itself had contributed to the initial currency mismatch and associated balance sheet problems. By engineering artificial expectations of stability, the regime had led market participants to disregard the possibility of exchange rate devaluations, leading to mispricing of risk, insufficient hedging and ultimately to misallocation of financial and real resources. Governments that found themselves in this position had very limited ability to mitigate the economic damage that was to come, but the policy choices that accompanied the exchange rate change often compounded the problem. Japan's experience provides another example, though the context was different. There is a perception in parts of Asia that the Japanese government's decision to let the yen appreciate in DATE was principally responsible for Japan's so-called \"lost decade\" of low growth. And, Japan, viewed through this prism, is cited as an example of the perils of letting an exchange rate move up in response to changing fundamentals. The reality is more complex. The problems of the Japanese economy in DATE were largely due to the aftereffects of the collapse of the real estate and asset price boom of DATE, a boom fueled in part by efforts by the monetary authorities to limit the appreciation of the yen. The size of the negative shock to demand from the collapse of the bubble was very substantial, and the capacity of the government and the central bank to mitigate the damage was constrained by the weakness in the banking system. A more forceful macroeconomic policy response, however, might have brought about a quicker recovery. In any case, the problem with the exchange rate choice was not the decision to let the rate adjust, but the decision to resist it and the role that played in magnifying the bubble, and thereby the subsequent damage from the fall. Given where we are DATE, and what we know about the relative merits of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes, what is the likely evolution of the current monetary system going forward? A few concluding observations. First, I think it is unlikely that we will see a substantial move toward monetary integration involving the major emerging market economies, in Asia or in the Western Hemisphere. As the economist Peter Kenen writes in his latest book, it is difficult DATE to envisage a substantial reduction in national currencies though the emergence of large regional monetary unions where they do not already exist. Within Europe, we may yet see a further enlargement of the euro area. There may be other circumstances in which individual economies can derive benefit from a currency board system or from dollarization or euroization. Countries trying to emerge from a period of high inflation may in the future, as they have in the past, adopt a fixed exchange rate as a nominal external anchor for a disinflation strategy. These seem likely to be exceptions, however, to a general move toward more flexible exchange rate regimes. Even as regional economic integration increases in Asia and other parts of the world, these economies seem a long way from the point where economic, or political conditions, will make a compelling case for monetary integration. In Europe, of course, the political case for monetary integration to a large extent preceded the economic case. And the architects of the European Union integration worked consciously to induce a level of economic integration in Europe that would induce conditions that more closely met the economist's test for an optimal currency area. For most of the emerging markets DATE, in contrast, the challenge is to establish the conditions that will enable them to live more comfortably in a world where their exchange rates will adjust more freely in response to changing fundamentals. As these economies become more open to capital flows, they will necessarily find it more difficult to occupy the tenuous middle ground with an exchange rate regime that is neither fully fixed nor flexible, but managed in a way that closely tracks the value of the dollar or carefully constrains fluctuations against the dollar. This does not mean that these countries can be indifferent to exchange rate movements or that the exchange rate is irrelevant to the conduct of monetary policy. For many small open emerging economies, price stability and exchange rate stability are obviously intertwined, and a monetary rule that responds effectively to inflation pressure cannot afford to overlook the signals coming from the foreign exchange market. But attempts to target a particular level for the exchange rate or the slope of the change in the rate in response to different conditions will, as the capital account becomes more open, inevitably, come with substantial risks to monetary and financial stability. Managing the transition to a more open capital account and a more flexible exchange rate regime is not a simple task. These transitions need to be handled with care and attention to the development of a strong institutional framework for monetary policy and the financial system. The more successful transitions came in contexts where the monetary authorities were independent of political constraint, where balance sheet problems and currency mismatches in the government and the financial system were not acute, where the prevailing legal framework provided reasonable protections for property rights and the enforcement of contract, and where there was effective supervision of the banking system. Where these conditions were weaker, the transitions from fixed exchange rate regimes were more traumatic. These conditions seem exacting, and the understandable need for caution often is invoked in defense of protracted and very gradual transitions. A certain degree of caution is wise: there is a great deal of risk in a poorly managed and premature shift toward flexibility. But there is risk in gradualism too. Delay magnifies the costs of living with the distortions caused by a managed rate. Once relaxed, exchange and capital controls are both difficult and costly to reintroduce, and even relatively modest steps back from an open regime can be damaging to confidence and credibility, without buying much in the way of lasting stability. The policy responses to the challenges that come with economic and financial integration principally involve choices for governments at the national level. International cooperation can in some circumstances help provide a more supportive environment, but there are no feasible changes to the architecture of the international financial system that offer the prospect of a durably stable external economic and financial environment for nations, large or small. Fundamentally, the only realistic choice for policymakers is to equip their economies with the flexibility to cope more successfully in this increasingly integrated global economy. And this means preparing for a world of more rather than less flexibility in exchange rate regimes. Thank you.",

                  "Donald L Kohn: Global economic integration and decoupling Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    During DATE, one of the most prominent themes sounded by policymakers, observers, and analysts of international economic developments has been \"globalization.\" Based on rapid advances in trade, finance, transportation, and communications, the world economy has become increasingly tightly knit. Large numbers of the world's population - including those in China, India, and the former Soviet Union - have emerged from their relative isolation to participate more fully in the global economic system. The impression has been that national borders and regional differences are becoming less and less relevant as businesses increasingly operate in a single global market. In DATE, however, especially as the housing sector in the United States slowed sharply and turmoil erupted in many financial markets, a different theme has come to the foreground: \"decoupling.\" This term refers to apparent divergences in economic performance among different regions of the world economy. First, there has been a perception that the business cycles of the United States and other industrial economies are becoming less synchronized, with the U.S. economy weakening more sharply than many other industrial economies over DATE. Second, decoupling is often used to refer to the fact that economic growth in the emerging market economies is holding up, even as growth slows substantially in the United States and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the industrial world. Finally, and as a related point, observers point to the fact that even as the financial markets of many industrial countries have been roiled by the turmoil that emerged DATE, conditions in the traditionally volatile financial markets of emerging market economies have proved surprisingly resilient. In my talk DATE, I would like to address two questions: First, is the world economy genuinely experiencing divergences in economic and financial performance being described as \"decoupling\"? And second, if true, can we reconcile the perception that globalization has made economies increasingly interlinked with the suggestion that the most recent U.S. slowdown has not been matched by slowing elsewhere to the extent that we have seen in recent cycles?NUM Global integration through trade and finance Undoubtedly, economies have become more integrated in DATE. For example, U.S. imports of goods and services have risen relative to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), from NUM percent in DATE to nearly NUM percent DATE. U.S. trade with other industrialized countries has more than doubled over this same period. Industrialized country trade with emerging market economies has experienced a far more dramatic increase.NUM These increases in trade are the natural result of various forces. Transport costs have been a big factor. Air shipping costs have declined over time, although some of this has been eroded recently with greater security costs and the rise in fuel prices. Costs of ocean shipping have come down, due to containerization, bulk shipping, and other efficiencies.NUM Policy-induced barriers, such as tariffs and other means of restraining international trade, also have declined, with progress especially marked in developing Asia and in Eastern Europe after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Additionally, information about production opportunities in foreign countries has become easier to attain, promoted in part by immigrants and multinational companies facilitating networking and by the enhanced availability of information through the Internet. These developments have led to expanded trade in traditional manufactured goods, but also have led to an expanded breadth of types of traded goods and especially services. As a consequence of these developments, internationally integrated production has risen. From the U.S. perspective, this rise has primarily occurred through growth in the import share of intermediate inputs used across all private industries. In DATE, the imported input share rose from around NUM-NUM/NUM percent in DATE to NUM-NUM/NUM percent by DATE. The international movement of workers leads to macroeconomic consequences, particularly for smaller developing countries. In DATE, an estimated $NUM billion in remittances went to developing countries, more than double the flow in DATE. These remittances represent a significant source of developing country income and broaden the scope for cyclical spillovers.NUM Another area of impressive growth in international linkages has been in financial services. We've seen increased cross-listings of stocks and more cross-border ownership and control of exchanges, banks, and securities settlement systems. Outside of the United States, in DATE, NUM percent of the assets in private equity portfolios were in foreign equities. DATE, this share has risen to NUM percent. For U.S. investors, the comparable shares grew from NUM percent of total equity portfolios to NUM percent. Bond portfolios have also become more international, especially for foreign investors. While financial integration has occurred globally, this growth has been uneven. Integration among industrialized countries, measured by the ratio of the sum of their foreign assets and liabilities to GDP, has tripled since DATE, while an analogous measure for emerging and developing economies has increased only about NUM percent.NUM One result of this financial integration is that the financial channels are growing in importance in the transmission of shocks between economies.NUM The extent of this integration has become painfully evident to investors and financial institutions during the current episode of financial turmoil, with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the United States spreading losses and funding pressures to many corners of the globe. Recent analysis of the size and sources of spillovers between the United States, the euro area, Japan, and other industrial countries finds a central role for international trade. But spillovers also occur through commodity prices and through financial variables such as short- and long-term interest rates and equity prices.NUM For example, when liquidity conditions tighten in one country, globally active banks may attempt to pull liquidity from overseas affiliates, reducing the liquidity consequences at home but simultaneously transmitting the shock abroad.NUM What is particularly interesting is that in some cases, financial linkages might now be more important for transmission than the traditional trade linkages. Decoupling during the recent U.S. slowdown I turn now to evidence regarding decoupling during the recent U.S. slowdown. Part of the reason the hypothesis of decoupling has gained so much traction is that the economies of the world had appeared particularly \"coupled\" during the last major downturn in the United States, the high-tech slowdown in DATE and DATE. Over DATE prior, during DATE and DATE, DATE real GDP growth in the United States averaged about NUM-NUM/NUM percent at an DATE rate; U.S. growth then slowed sharply to about NUM percent during DATE and DATE before recovering over the subsequent DATE. In other major industrialized countries, average growth slowed similarly, but the recovery was slower.NUM In the emerging market world, economic growth moved in tandem with U.S. growth, falling from more than NUM percent to about NUM-NUM/NUM percent, then recovering to more than NUM-NUM/NUM percent.NUM What about our more recent experience? During the first three quarters of DATE, the U.S. economy was growing at a solid pace of about NUM percent at an DATE rate. Over DATE, U.S. growth slowed to an average of about NUM/NUM percent, while growth in other industrialized countries stayed much closer to trend rates at about NUM-NUM/NUM percent, and growth in the emerging market economies, at NUM-NUM/NUM percent, held up quite well. It is important to keep in mind, however, that we are still in the midst of the current episode. Financial markets remain stressed; housing markets in many countries are adjusting after a sharp run-up in prices; and the effects of the turmoil on economic activity in the United States and elsewhere are still working themselves out. Accordingly, it is too early to tell how correlated U.S. and foreign activity will have been in this period. One piece of research on business cycles in G-NUM economies, done by staff at the Federal Reserve Board, shows how difficult it is to establish with any confidence that business cycles have become more synchronized in DATE, despite trade and financial integration having clearly increased.NUM Other research, which shows a modest convergence of business cycles across a larger group of industrial economies, fails to find an increase in the correlation of industrial country cycles with emerging market economy cycles.NUM NUM Bayoumi and Swiston (DATE); International Monetary Fund (DATE). NUM Cetorelli and Goldberg (DATE) provide evidence of this transmission by globally active U.S. banks. NUM The industrialized-country aggregate referred to here is a weighted average of the real GDP growth rates of Canada, Denmark, the euro area, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The weights are proportional to U.S. dollar-denominated GDP computed at market exchange rates. Growth in industrialized countries went from about NUM-NUM/NUM percent to NUM-NUM/NUM percent, then recovered only to NUM-NUM/NUM percent. The recovery in the other industrialized countries took longer than in the United States, with growth picking up further after DATE, but the pattern was broadly similar. NUM The emerging market economies aggregate is based on the real GDP growth rates of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela with the same weighting scheme as that used for industrial countries. NUM Doyle and Faust (DATE). NUM Kose, Otrok, and Prasad (DATE). BIS Review NUM/DATE The other dimension of recent linkages is financial, where the evidence is clearer. First, few question the importance of financial linkages between the United States and other industrial economies, which is an area where decoupling clearly has not occurred during the recent episode. While industrial country markets for stocks and bonds have displayed a high degree of co-movement for DATE, in the current episode we are seeing notable new correlations across money markets, with disruptions in funding markets showing up in the euro area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Canada, as well as in the United States. Some of the effects of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis on financial markets in these countries occurred as a result of direct or indirect balance sheet exposures by their financial institutions to U.S. securities. Other adverse consequences for foreign financial institutions occurred when entire markets, such as that for asset-backed commercial paper, became impaired. In contrast, some have pointed to the apparent resilience of financial conditions in emerging market economies during DATE as an example of decoupling. In particular, the disruptions in the advanced economies have had only limited impacts on money markets in emerging market economies, and other financial market indicators in emerging market economies appear to have held up relatively well. For example, the spreads of emerging market sovereign bond yields over U.S. Treasury securities have risen since DATE, but by only about NUM/NUM of the rise in the average U.S. corporate high-yield spread over U.S. Treasury securities. That rise is roughly half the average in several previous episodes of pressure on U.S. corporate bond prices over the period from DATE to DATE; these episodes include, among others, the Russian and Long-Term Capital Management crisis of DATE, the DATE surge in corporate defaults and bankruptcies, and growing concerns about U.S. auto companies in DATE. In addition, while stock prices in some emerging market countries have not performed well, a broad aggregate for these markets shows stock prices up over DATE, while the advanced economy indexes have exhibited double-digit declines, on average.NUM Certainly, stock prices in the emerging market economies moved downward during acute periods of U.S. financial stress over DATE. However, these movements were similar in scale to those seen in industrial country equity markets, and during the intervening periods when global pressures were less intense, the prices of emerging market equities rebounded more substantially than those of industrial countries. Reconciling apparent decoupling with integration How do we reconcile the obvious expansion of international trade, labor, and financial flows with the evidence, albeit mixed, of decoupling in the recent period? Three different points can help us achieve this reconciliation. The first point is purely conceptual. The conventional wisdom is that greater international trade leads demand shocks to reverberate more intensely across international markets. However, we need to recognize that economic theory does not predict that greater economic and financial integration will necessarily result in increased co-movement of output across nations. One way in which integration might lead to less synchronization is through the tendency of international trade to promote specialization of production. If economies become more specialized, then their economic growth, and even equity markets, may be driven more by developments that are specific to the industries that have taken root in each country.NUM The second point in this reconciliation stems from the observation that the correlation of business cycles will be specific to the shocks driving the cycles. In DATE and DATE, the sharp decline in growth in the foreign countries soon after the U.S. economy slowed reflected the global nature of the bursting of the technology bubble and its worldwide transmission through equity markets and manufacturing. In the current slowdown, the implosion of the housing sector is playing the most prominent role in dragging down U.S. GDP growth. As construction utilizes local inputs and results in an output that is not traded internationally, its spillovers abroad are more limited. To be sure, a portion of the decline in domestic demand in the United States has been absorbed by foreign economies as our imports have fallen and exports have risen. However, these indirect spillovers are small compared with the more direct effects that would result from a shock in the tradable goods sector or from one of more global origin. Although the financial turmoil triggered by problems in the U.S. housing sector has been more international in scope, in particular with respect to other industrialized countries, its effects on the real side of foreign economies appears to have been limited, at least to date. The recent period also has been one of enhanced demand for commodities and sharp runups in many commodity prices, including for fuels, metals, and food. The actual increase in demand is benefiting many producers of commodities and is helping to offset the effect of weakening of export markets in industrial countries, thus contributing to the resilience of output in many emerging market economies. The third and final point is that structural changes in emerging market economies have helped these countries during the recent period. One change in particular is the strengthening of the policy environment. With improved economic and financial policies, emerging market economies are more flexible and less subject to internal and external shocks that scare investors and disrupt asset markets. Inflation rates have come down dramatically since DATE, in part as a result of better monetary policy, assisted in many cases by more flexible exchange rate regimes that allowed monetary authorities to focus more intensively on domestic price stability. In addition, structural progress has been made on the fiscal side in emerging markets. Fiscal balances are much improved, and many emerging market economies are running current account surpluses. Improvements in the policy environment have helped reinforce perceptions that emerging market assets, on average, are less risky than in the past and are less likely to be sold off in the event of financial disruptions and generalized retreats from risk, such as we have seen since DATE. As evidence of this, as I noted earlier, emerging market credit spreads have become less sensitive to movements in industrial country corporate spreads, and this trend has been ongoing even prior to the events of DATE. Inflation and decoupling Up until now, I have been discussing whether movements in economic activity have or have not decoupled from each other. But whether or not business cycles have diverged, it is clear that the sharp increase in many commodity prices has given rise to highly coincident increases in inflation rates around the world. In industrialized economies, such as the United States, rising inflation has chiefly reflected the surge in energy prices, whereas in developing countries, for which food takes up more of household budgets, rising food costs have been a more important culprit. The reasons for the trajectory and persistence of increases in prices of food and energy DATE, as global growth has moderated, are not entirely clear. The upward trend in prices of food and energy over the past several DATE, however, importantly reflects the pressures posed by rapidly growing demand in developing economies against relatively inelastic global supplies of commodities. For the moment, higher headline rates of inflation have shown only a few tentative signs of embedding themselves in core inflation or in longer-term inflation expectations. However, policymakers around the world must monitor the situation carefully for signs that the increases in relative prices globally do not generate persistently higher inflation. Additionally, in those countries where strong commodity demands are associated with rapid growth in aggregate demand that outstrips potential supply, actions to contain inflation by restraining aggregate demand would contribute to global price stability. Conclusion To sum up, the evidence sometimes presented as indicative of a divergence in economic performance, referred to as decoupling, is not definitive. It is certainly the case that in DATE, the U.S. economy slowed to a greater extent than other industrial economies, and economic activity in the industrial economies, in aggregate, has slowed more than in the emerging market economies. This experience contrasts with that near DATE, when the economic downturn of DATE through DATE was felt more uniformly throughout the global economy. In addition, financial conditions in most emerging market economies have remained relatively stable, considering the turmoil that overtook industrial country financial markets over DATE. Even so, neither economic growth nor financial markets in the different regions of the world moved in lockstep in the past, nor are they expected to do so across all business cycles. It is far from clear that the divergences in performance we have seen of late, which are tentative in any event, represent distinct breaks from historical benchmarks. The recent divergences of economic performance reflect a particular set of shocks that have hit the global economy, as well as changes in the way that different economies have responded to those shocks. As our global economy becomes more intertwined and complex, the nature and transmission of business cycles and the associated policy responses will no doubt continue to evolve. Economies benefit from having independent monetary policies that provide room to respond flexibly to alternative configurations of economic and financial shocks. These benefits could be increased if exchange rate flexibility were to become more widespread and monetary policies given greater latitude to respond to shocks wherever they originate.

                  "Timothy F Geithner: The economic dynamics of global integration Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Forum on Global Leadership: US Competitiveness in a Globally Integrated Economy, Washington DC, DATE.    We are meeting at a time of relatively favorable U.S. economic performance, but also of growing concern about our relative position in the world and our longer-term economic prospects at home. On a wide range of measures, the American economy and American business are performing well. We are in DATE of expansion in the United States and in the midst of the strongest global economic expansion in DATE. Corporate profits as a share of GDP are close to the highest level in DATE. Corporate balance sheets are healthy. The DATE trailing bond default rate has stayed near zero DATE, and the delinquency rate on commercial and industrial loans at banks remains extremely low. We have seen a substantial acceleration in trend productivity growth over DATE. And although productivity gains have slowed recently, as they typically do as expansions mature, U.S. companies remain at the forefront of changes in science and technology-and in the application of those innovations to business processes across a range of industries. Overall, the U.S. economy continues to display remarkable resilience and flexibility, despite a range of adverse shocks. This is a remarkably favorable picture; and yet there is growing concern about the long-term challenges for the U.S. economy and their implications for future prosperity. In parts of the business community, there is growing anxiety about a perceived shift in the locus of dynamism and growth away from the United States toward Asia and other parts of the world. Public opinion surveys report increased concern among Americans about economic security; about the prospects for future income growth and economic mobility; and about the implications of the long-term increase in income inequality. And there we can see growing concern among the general public and in the business community about the struggle to find a political consensus to support reforms to help us meet these challenges. The United States has long been one of the most open of the major economies. This basic policy choice, along with a range of other actions that have made our economy relatively flexible, has allowed us to be a substantial beneficiary of the rapid increase in global economic integration and in the growing economic success of the rest of the world. Globalization has brought challenges as well as benefits, however. The combined forces of technological change, immigration, and the rapid integration of China, India, and other economies into the world economy are altering the dynamics of competitive pressures on U.S. companies. The pace of change seems to be increasing, and more things we produce, and more of our services, are becoming tradable. And this seems to have fed anxiety, among firms and their employees, about the challenges in coping with these forces. These changes have taken place in the context of a longer-term increase in income inequality in the United States. Incomes have grown more rapidly for the richer and better educated than for those at lower points of the income scale. These changes have, in turn, contributed to some erosion in the strength of the political center in the United States on a range of economic policy issues. Surveys suggest diminished support for global trade. And there is more divisiveness on a range of issues such as tax policy and the appropriate role for government in the regulation of economic activity. Over DATE and more, the U.S. economy has enjoyed some substantial and important relative advantages. Among the most important of these are the quality of our best universities; our openness to change; the incentives provided for innovation; the strength of property rights; the depth and liquidity of our world-class financial markets; and a record of stability in macroeconomic policy. These relative strengths of the U.S. economy remain significant and substantial. But the rest of the world is getting better at establishing the important conditions for dynamism and innovation. These improvements are not a reflection of U.S. weakness, nor are they themselves a threat to U.S. competitiveness. We will benefit from more rapid growth in the rest of the world, but at the same time we need to be more attentive to addressing a range of challenges that could ultimately damage the prospect for future growth in living standards here at home. I want to talk about challenges we face in four areas:  sustaining support for global economic integration,  the role of public policy in education and other areas that are critical to our capacity to adapt to change,  regulation and the role of the market, and  macroeconomic policy. Let me start with openness. The pressures that have come with globalization and technological change have led many to suggest that we should become less open as a country, that we should slow the pace of integration, or that we should provide greater insulation or protection from competition for selective parts of the U.S. economy. Moving in this direction would, I believe, be a fundamental mistake. More than ever before our fortunes are linked to those of the global economy. If anything, we need to become more open, not less; more open to trade in goods and services, but also to investment, to people and to ideas. Global integration is not the solution to all our problems, but acting to restrict it or to insulate us from its consequences would damage our capacity to grow and to adapt to change, and these costs would make it harder, not easier, to deal with our longer-term challenges. To the extent we are reluctant to remove restrictions or subsidies in the United States, we make it easier for the forces in other countries to block reforms from which we would benefit. The world has a lot of experience with the costs and benefits of protection, and the balance of judgment on those questions has not significantly changed even with all the changes that technology and policy have brought to global trade. Economies that are more open have generally seen more rapid growth, both in incomes and in employment. Economies that are less open have generally grown less rapidly. Openness itself, of course, is not enough. Our capacity to adapt to change depends in part on the effectiveness of government policy in a range of important areas. Education seems the most obvious of these, but policy in health care, in public infrastructure, and many other areas will also play an increasingly important role in determining the relative strength of the U.S. economy in this more integrated world. The U.S. educational system combines the strengths of high completion rates for secondary education, a rich variety of post-secondary school educational options, and exceptionally strong elite universities, with the weaknesses of substantial unevenness in the quality of public education, and large disparities in the educational opportunities available to those of modest income and the relatively rich. By some estimates, students from families in the bottom half of the income distribution account for only NUM percent of all places in our elite universities. An education system should be judged by how it serves the majority of the population, not just the performance of its best institutions. And as technological progress continues and global integration increases, our system will be judged by how good a job it does equipping a broader range of students with the skills commensurate with these challenges. In communities across the country, there are encouraging efforts at experimentation and reform. Progress is probably going to require more substantial public investments in education going forward. Health care does not usually make the agenda of conferences on competitiveness, but we're seeing a welcome wave of attention in the business community to the broader economic imperative of health care reform. The U.S. system has compelling strengths in the quality of care and the choices available to much of the population. But our system is also remarkable for the magnitude of the costs, the incidence of those costs across the economy, the number of uninsured, and our poor performance on health outcomes even compared with less wealthy economies. To cite just one example, infant mortality rates in the United States are more than two times the level in Japan. In a world in which economic performance depends increasingly on flexibility and adaptability to change, we probably need to move to a system in which a change in employer or profession does not carry the substantial uncertainty it does DATE about how one will provide for one's health and that of one's family. This seems fundamental to the willingness of Americans to support the level of openness to trade and to change that is an essential part of our present and our future. A defining feature of the American economy has been our embrace of the market, and the recognition that market forces are, in general, the most effective way of allocating resources. But markets cannot solve all problems, and government policy plays an important role in how well markets function. The test of policy is not just in the incentives we create for competition and innovation, but also in the clarity and stability offered by the regulatory framework and in the quality of public goods that governments deliver. Any one who travels outside the United States DATE returns with an appreciation about how rapidly public infrastructure is improving in many parts of the world, relative to what is evident in many parts of the United States. As global markets become more integrated and companies and capital can move more freely across borders, policymakers will face new challenges in the design of regulations. They will have to look more carefully at the balance of benefits and costs, when companies have more choice about where to invest. They will have to find ways for regulations to evolve more quickly in response to developments in markets. They will have to explore ways to cooperate more closely with other governments, where national approaches alone cannot be effective. We need to get used to a world in which we will see, in many areas, less willingness to adopt a U.S. model or to defer to a U.S. view on the appropriate global standard. You can see some of these dynamics in the financial arena, and concern about the erosion in the relative position of the U.S. financial system. Financial markets outside the United States are now deeper and more liquid than they used to be, making it easier for companies to raise capital domestically at reasonable cost. These financial markets are at an earlier stage in the process of capital market development, and they will therefore experience rapid growth in securitization and the role of derivatives. These factors, more than other differences in tax, accounting, or legal regulatory regimes, account for the bulk of the declines' share of equity and debt raised in the United States by companies around the world. And this shift is something that we benefit from, not just in the direct sense that U.S. financial institutions play an important role in those markets, but in the broader sense that we will gain from the improvements in economic growth that come from financial market development around the world. But in this context, we need to be more attentive to the risk that specific aspects of our system, regulations or other constraints, create a greater disincentive to locate a financial business here, or to invest here, or to raise capital here, than would have been the case DATE. We need to take a careful look at how we regulate financial activity in a world where capital is more mobile, and the structure of the financial system has diverged substantially from the system for which our regulatory framework was designed. That does not mean we should contemplate weaker regulation or lower standards. The strength of the U.S. system is in part the result of the confidence we have developed in the integrity and resilience of our markets, in part by establishing strong standards for investor protection, market practices, and safety and soundness. Sustaining this confidence will be critical to the future strength of our financial system. To complete this list of policy challenges that are important to U.S. competitiveness, let me conclude with a few brief points on the broader imperatives of macroeconomic policy. The United States faces very substantial gaps between our fiscal resources and our expenditure commitments. The size of these gaps, these deficits, have been masked in DATE by a substantial, unanticipated and probably transitory surge in revenues, and by an unusually long period of unusually low long-term interest rates, in part the consequence of foreign official capital flows. But these gaps remain substantial and the U.S. fiscal position is unsustainable. Time does not help. We are going to have to begin to develop a political consensus on the mix of policy changes that can bring our commitment and resources more into balance, if we are to preserve confidence in our market and our long-term economic prospects. One of the most important roles for public policy is the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework that enables firms to make long-term investment decisions. In this sense, the fiscal policy choices ahead for this country will be critically important to the overall environment in which U.S. enterprises operate. The business community will play an important role in shaping the policy response to these longer-term economic challenges. These reforms will have a long fuse. The benefits will be shared broadly, rather than captured specifically by particular sectors of the economy. American companies have a strong collective interest in sustaining public support for global integration, improving the quality of public goods the government provides in education, health care and infrastructure, and in preserving confidence in U.S. fiscal sustainability.

                  "Randall S Kroszner: The United States in the international financial system - a separate reality? Resolving two puzzles in the international accounts Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Central Bank of Argentina DATE Money and Banking Conference \"Financial turbulence - impact on developed and emerging economies\", Buenos Aires, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    I would like to thank the organizers here at the Bank for inviting me to this DATE's conference and for giving me the opportunity to join Madam Hu and Bill White in this session on \"Different Tools, Different Realities. Differences in \"tools\" have been much discussed recently, in both the abstract (such as how the goals of monetary policy are set and communicated) and the operational (such as the structure of facilities used to provide liquidity to the financial system). Rather than continue this discussion, I would like to focus on the second part of the session title and ask whether the United States can be said to face a different economic \"reality\" than that faced by the rest of the world. The term reality can, of course, be interpreted in a number of ways; DATE, I am going to use it to refer to international trade and financial linkages that transmit disturbances, or \"shocks,\" from one economy to another. In asking whether the United States faces a different reality, I am, in effect, asking whether the United States has become decoupled from the global economy. After arguing against the decoupling hypothesis, I will address two apparent puzzles in the international financial accounts that might suggest that the United States faces different financial constraints than other countries. However, I will show that a careful analysis of the data reveals that the United States, in fact, faces a \"reality\" very similar to that of other countries. Are the United States and the rest of the world decoupled? Some commentators suggested last DATE that the rest of the world would remain relatively unaffected by the housing slowdown in the United States. However, as turmoil emerged in financial systems around the world in DATE, it became clear that this was not the case. Concerns about financial securities backed by U.S. mortgages spread to assetbacked securities more generally, which led to funding difficulties in European money markets at anything but the shortest maturities. Moving into DATE, concerns about potential spillovers from slower U.S. growth and weaknesses in the financial system weighed increasingly on advanced economy equity markets. As the step-down in growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in a number of advanced economies became apparent, we also began to see reduced growth and prospects for growth in many emerging market economies, and stock markets in emerging economies declined sharply. Throughout the world, the challenges posed by weakening economic activity were further complicated by mounting inflationary pressures as food and energy prices soared. By now I believe it has become clear that the initial assessment that the United States had decoupled from the rest of the world was incorrect, and that, in fact, the global economy remains closely connected by both trade and financial linkages. Global trade linkages Trade linkages among countries are, broadly speaking, relatively well understood: One country's imports are another's exports. That is, of course, an oversimplification, but it captures a key element of global trade linkages, that exports to other countries can provide a direct and powerful stimulus to the domestic economy. The importance and benefits of free trade are widely accepted, although agreement on how to allocate these benefits is not always easy to come by. When domestic markets for goods and services are unrestricted and open to sellers worldwide and when supply adjusts efficiently to meet changes in demand, costs to consumers are minimized. The recent sharp increases in global food prices have underscored the importance of reducing barriers to trade in agricultural products. Reducing such barriers was one of the key subjects of the latest set of talks in the Doha round, and I am disheartened that this round of talks collapsed. Given the urgent need to expand the global food supply to meet burgeoning world demand, it is particularly unfortunate that these negotiations were unable to make progress. Global financial linkages DATE's global financial linkages are quite complex and subtle. The nature and extent of these financial linkages are reflected in a range of characteristics, which include not only the net international investment positions but also the sizes of gross cross-border claims and liabilities positions, the composition of these positions by asset type, and the returns on the underlying assets. A quick review of these characteristics of U. S. financial linkages to the world will help resolve some puzzles in international finance that might otherwise suggest that the United States faces a different \"reality\" than other countries. First, investments made by U.S. residents abroad and by foreigners in the United States are enormous, both in absolute terms and as shares of GDP. (See figure NUM.) Last DATE, for example, U.S. liabilities to foreigners totaled more than $NUM trillion, exceeding NUM percent of U.S. GDP. At the same time, U.S. claims on foreigners totaled $NUM trillion, roughly NUM percent of U.S. GDP. Even the net liability position of the United States is sizeable, $NUM trillion or more than NUM percent of GDP. This net position as a share of GDP has remained fairly constant in recent DATEs, while gross claims and liabilities have both been growing steadily. Second, within these enormous gross positions is a great variety of types of claims and liabilities, including many forms of direct investment, equity securities, and debt instruments.NUM (See figure NUM.) The composition of U.S. liabilities is quite different than the composition of U.S. claims on the rest of the world. For example, more than two-thirds of U.S. liabilities are in the form of debt instruments, while over half of U.S. claims are in equity securities and direct investment. Some call this the \"venture capitalist\" nature of the U.S. external position: U.S. investments abroad tend to be concentrated in relatively risky equity instruments, but liabilities of the United States tend to be in low-volatility debt instruments. Third, the different asset classes tend to have different rates of return for both capital gains and income. (See figure NUM.) The return on equity securities (both claims and liabilities), for instance, is mainly from capital gains, while the return on debt instruments and direct investment is primarily from income. For debt and equity securities, the income return and the rate of capital gain on U.S. claims are roughly the same as those on U.S. liabilities. This is not true, however, for direct investment: The income return on direct investment by the United States in other countries is more than twice as high as the income return foreigners receive on their direct investment in the United States. Taking into account the differences in returns and the differences in the composition of assets, the total return on U.S. claims turns out to be about NUM percentage points per DATE higher than the return that the United States pays on its liabilities to the rest of the world. Puzzles in the U.S. international accounts Some apparently puzzling features of the U.S. cross-border investment positions have given rise to a number of hypotheses, several of which spring from the notion that the United States is unique in important respects. For example, in two cases that I will discuss DATE, some observers have concluded, first, that the United States is able to borrow on highly advantageous terms to finance its external deficits and, second, that the United States receives a much higher return on its foreign investments than other countries receive on their investments in the United States. Some novel theories have been developed to support these interpretations. Recent work by Federal Reserve staff, however, has shown that one need not resort to such exotic explanations to understand the behavior of the international accounts. Instead, a careful look at the published data reveals that differences in the three characteristics of U.S. claims and liabilities that I just discussed - returns, composition, and size -contain the key to understanding these apparently anomalous results and, hence, that the United States faces a \"reality\" similar to that of other countries. Puzzle NUM: Do foreigners pay to lend to the United States? The first puzzle is longstanding and is well known within the international finance community: Why does it appear that foreigners pay to lend to the United States? For more than NUM DATEs, the U.S. net international investment position has been negative. As I just mentioned, in DATE the net liability position of the United States was NUM percent of GDP. (See figure NUM.) Nonetheless, and somewhat surprisingly, the income received by U.S. residents on their foreign investments has consistently exceeded that received by foreigners on their holdings in the United States. This difference totaled $NUM billion in DATE. So, at first blush, it might appear that the rest of the world pays the United States for the privilege of lending to it. Put differently, imagine a credit card that paid you interest to carry a debt balance, instead of the other way around. Sign me up! This U.S. investment income puzzle has piqued the interest of some well-known economists. For example, in DATE, Milton Friedman wrote: Clearly, if our investments abroad are yielding a positive return, their capital value must be positive not negative. Is this a defect of the figures on current flows, or is it a defect of the balance-sheet figures?NUM Friedman's question suggests that the reported data must either be wrong or be missing some important component. Following this reasoning, some researchers have inferred the existence of unrecorded U.S. claims based on the observation of positive net investment income. Such unrecorded claims are sometimes called \"dark matter\". The term is borrowed from physics; dark matter cannot be seen, but its presence can be inferred from its effects on visible matter. These researchers suggest that unobserved assets, particularly intellectual property, are so large that the true claims position substantially exceeds the $NUM trillion in U.S. liabilities to foreigners. A careful look at the data, however, reveals that while unrecorded intellectual property may make a modest contribution to U.S. claims, there is no evidence of large-scale mismeasurement on the order of magnitude claimed by proponents of the \"dark matter\" theory. In fact, Federal Reserve staff research suggests just the opposite - that is, if anything, the true U.S. net investment position is slightly more negative than the published data show. How then can we resolve this puzzle? The answer lies in the returns, composition, and size of U.S. claims and liabilities. As I mentioned earlier, for most cross-border assets, including debt and equity, the income component of the return paid on U.S. liabilities is roughly equal to that received on claims. The return received on U.S. direct investment claims on the rest of the world, however, is much larger than that paid by the United States on its direct investment liabilities to the rest of the world or on any other asset. Additionally, direct investment is a greater share of U.S. claims than it is of U.S. liabilities. With this combination of return and compositional differences, U.S. claims in total earn about one percentage point per DATE more than the United States pays on its liabilities. This rate of return differential does not, by itself, lead to positive net income on a negative net position: If the U.S. net liability position of $NUM trillion were the result of more modest gross positions, then U.S. net income might not be positive. The enormous gross positions magnify the impact of the different rates of returns on claims and liabilities, so, on net, income receipts are positive. Because of this leverage effect, it is not particularly informative to compare the net position to net income or to compute a rate of return on the net position. Ultimately, this is why the \"dark matter\" argument fails, because it relies on the negative net position to infer the existence of missing assets. The United States is not unique in this regard. In several other countries, including the United Kingdom, net investment income is positive despite a large net liability position. And, as in the United States, a difference in the rate of return on direct investment claims and liabilities is largely responsible. Taken together, these observations go a long way toward resolving the apparent puzzle: Positive net investment income receipts in the face of a net liability in the investment position can be explained by differences between the composition of U.S. claims and liabilities and between the corresponding rates of return, magnified by the leverage effect of the enormous gross positions. The remaining question is, what accounts for the high return on U.S. direct investment claims? This high return may in part reflect a risk premium associated with investments in emerging economies. Tax policy may also play a role - some analysts have suggested that multinational entities are shifting intangible assets such as intellectual property to countries with more-favorable tax laws in order to reduce their overall tax burden. However, given the magnitudes involved, it seems unlikely that unrecorded intangible assets could account for a substantial part of the return differential. The topic remains the subject of ongoing research. Puzzle NUM: Can the United States borrow without increasing its debt? The second puzzle has emerged more recently: Why does it seem that the United States can borrow without a corresponding increase in its debt? As is well known, the United States has been running large current account deficits for many DATEs. Financing these deficits has required substantial borrowing from abroad. However, the net increase in U.S. liabilities has been quite small relative to the cumulated current account deficits. To be more specific, over the past six DATEs, the United States has run current account deficits that add up to over $NUM trillion, and these deficits have required an equivalent amount of financing from the foreign sector. One might have expected this borrowing to have led to equally sizable increases in the U.S. external debt, but this has not been the case. Over DATE, U.S. net liabilities increased by only $NUM billion, which is $NUM trillion less than the cumulated current account deficits.NUM (See figure NUM.) So it might seem that the United States has been able to borrow large amounts from abroad while accumulating few additional liabilities. Returning to the credit card analogy, imagine a charge card with a balance that increases by only a small fraction of your charges. No bank would issue such a card; how could a country do effectively the same thing? Unlike a credit card balance, however, changes in the U.S. net external debt balance reflect more than just net transactions. There are also changes to the net position owing to capital gains and other adjustments to the values of claims and liabilities. As I mentioned, over the past six DATEs, the net position has diverged from the cumulated current account by about $NUM trillion, which represents capital gains and other adjustments. About $NUM trillion of this divergence is due to valuation adjustments (capital gains) favoring U.S. claims; these adjustments arise from observed movements in asset prices and the dollar. An additional $NUM billion is labeled \"other adjustments\" by the agency that maintains and publishes the international transactions accounts in the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Some researchers have interpreted these \"other adjustments\" as additional capital gains. These adjustments significantly favor U.S. claims, and including them in capital gains doubles the total return advantage in favor of U.S. claims from the published estimate of about NUM percentage points per DATE to NUM percentage points per DATE. Borrowing a phrase popularized by Charles de Gaulle, these researchers suggest that this return differential constitutes an \"exorbitant privilege\" enjoyed by the United States. However, Federal Reserve staff have used survey data for the underlying cross-border positions to show that these \"other adjustments\" are not hidden capital gains but instead arise from imprecision in the measurement of a number of balance of payments flows and cross-border positions. As such, the returns advantage in favor of U.S. investments is, in fact, half the size claimed by proponents of \"exorbitant privilege\" and is well in line with the BEA's published data. As with the first, the key to resolving the second puzzle lies in differences in portfolio returns, composition, and size. Most U.S. liabilities are debt securities, which realize small capital gains, while a large fraction of U.S. claims on the rest of the world are equity securities, which realize much larger capital gains. The result is a net difference in the capital gains rate slightly in favor of U.S. investors. When this rate differential is applied to the enormous gross claims and liabilities positions, however, it generates a sizable adjustment to the net investment position. As also was the case with the first puzzle, the United States is not unique in regard to this second puzzle. For several other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the international investment positions have for extended periods diverged from the value suggested by historical current account balances, in a manner similar to that of the United States. The divergence can go the other way as well - Switzerland and Japan currently report net investment positions substantially less positive than those suggested by their persistent current account surpluses. Conclusions Our experience since the beginning of the recent financial turmoil strongly suggests that the global economy is bound together by strong trade and financial linkages, and through them the United States remains closely coupled to the global economy. The United States thus faces economic \"realities\" similar to those of the advanced and emerging market economies. These linkages provide powerful connections or \"couplings\" among economies and can contribute importantly to the efficient operation of global markets. The nature and extent of financial linkages between economies both depend on several characteristics of cross-border investment, including the size and composition of the underlying gross positions, as well as the performance of the underlying assets. Two apparent puzzles concerning these international linkages - the apparent willingness of foreigners to pay to lend to the United States and the apparent ability of the United States to borrow without a corresponding increase in its debt - can be explained by careful analyses of these data, without resorting to theories such as \"dark matter\" or \"exorbitant privilege. In the end, the economic realities faced by the United States are not so different from those faced by the rest of the world. References Curcuru, Stephanie E., Tomas Dvorak, and Francis E.

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Financial supervision issues Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Securities Industry Association Annual Meeting, Boca Raton, Florida, DATE.    I want to thank you for the invitation to speak at this DATE meeting of the Securities Industry Association (SIA). The financial services industry continues to evolve to meet the challenges posed by mergers, new financial instruments, and changing regulatory frameworks. The Federal Reserve Board, as the umbrella supervisor of financial holding companies, has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness and relevance of regulation and supervision in this changing environment. Some of the issues that we have been dealing with recently are of mutual concern to both broker-dealers and commercial bankers - albeit they may represent different sides of the coin. Others involve reconciling the differing perspectives and regulatory environments of investment firms and commercial banks around similar financial products and activities in the wake of financial conglomeration. DATE I would like to bring you up-to-date on three such issues, as well as highlight some aspects of the Federal Reserve's proposed anti-tying guidelines. In all of these areas, I encourage your participation as we work toward new regulatory guidance. Accounting for securities The first supervisory issue I would like to discuss involves accounting for investment securities. The recent accounting guidance, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, or EITF NUM-NUM, has raised serious questions about accounting for investments that are held in available-for-sale portfolios. As many of you are aware, when the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) came to its consensus DATE, it was not intending to dramatically change accounting practices for debt securities. But in DATE, the public accounting firms began interpreting the guidance very differently. Specifically, if a security was sold from the available-for-sale investment portfolio at a loss, the new interpretation called into question the facts and circumstances that should be used to determine if the remaining portfolio should be viewed as \"other than temporarily impaired,\" and thereby marked down to the lower of cost or market through earnings (LOCOM). At the Federal Reserve, we were concerned about the interpretation since most banks use their available-for-sale portfolio to manage their net interest margin on longer-term, fixed-rate deposits and funding. A LOCOM accounting model applied to such instruments is not consistent with this important management function. For asset-liability management purposes, historical cost accounting better reflects the use of the available-for-sale portfolio to hedge this type of interest rate risk. We have always expected banks to regularly review the fair values of all their securities. But the concept of \"tainting\" due to realized losses from the available-for-sale portfolio had not been widely applied in such a narrow way. I commend FASB for listening to questions raised by preparers, auditors, and bank regulators and for agreeing to defer the effective date of the impairment guidance in this interpretation. FASB has also issued some implementation guidance, and its comment period ran until DATE. To be sure, the fixed-income research groups of a number of SIA members have played an important role in educating their commercial bank customers on the issues surrounding EITF NUM-NUM over DATE. However, more work may be needed and I would encourage you to closely monitor FASB's deliberations. Pay particular attention to the facts and circumstances that should be considered. Note that the guidance allows sales of available-for-sale securities at a loss for the same reasons sales of held-to-maturity securities are permitted without tainting the remaining portfolio. For example, mergers or changes in regulatory capital justify untainted sales. The guidance also permits sales for unexpected and significant changes in liquidity needs or for increases in interest rates. In practice, EITF NUM-NUM should make all organizations that have available-for-sale securities review their procedures for identifying impairment. Clearly, investors should continue to monitor for credit downgrades and changes in prepayment speeds, especially for interest-only strips and mortgage-backed securities booked at a premium. But the trigger for recognizing impairments for changes in interest rates under EITF NUM-NUM would no longer be an intent to sell, but rather whether the investor no longer intends to hold the security until fair value recovers to its amortized cost. Also note that the disclosure aspects of EITF NUM-NUM do apply to DATE financial statements. The major change is separate disclosure of securities whose fair value is below carrying cost. Organizations must now disclose separately the amount of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for DATE, and in the narrative discuss why the loss has not yet been recognized. As dealers in investment securities for banks and other investors, your organizations should be aware of the importance of remaining informed about emerging accounting interpretations that deal with longaccepted practices - not only in the context of providing products and services to your customers, but also in your own bank-like entities that may be affected as investors. Regulatory capital issues Let me now move on to some accounting issues that relate broadly to the new capital framework for the largest U.S.-based financial institutions, including broker-dealers who wish to have consolidated supervision for purposes of meeting European Union requirements. In general, this entails brokerdealer implementation of Basel II capital requirements. As you know, the Basel II effort to revise bank risk-based capital standards is now in its final stages and moving toward implementation. Importantly, that effort has adopted an approach to credit risk for instruments held in the banking book that differs from the current capital rules applied to instruments held in the trading book under the DATE Market Risk Amendment (MRA) to the Basel Accord. Clearly, the fair valuing or \"marking to market\" of commercial bank trading portfolios and the implied short-term holding periods of such positions factor into the different approaches. We must remember, however, that the MRA was adopted at a time when bank trading portfolios looked very different from DATE. Significant growth in structured transactions, collateralized debt obligations, and credit derivatives are just a few examples of the significant developments over DATE. Moreover, the MRA was structured with commercial banks in mind and not broker-dealers who, as you know, mark most of their balance sheets to market. Also, both banking organizations and investment firms appear to be holding less-liquid instruments at fair value over longer time horizons than has been traditionally associated with the concept of a commercial bank trading account. Taken together, these industry and regulatory dynamics suggest that the time may have arrived for supervisors to begin to review the appropriateness of the DATE MRA for commercial bank trading accounts and investment firm fair-valued holdings. In an initial effort to fully identify the types and characteristics of instruments that banks hold in their trading accounts, and that securities firms hold at fair value, a joint subgroup of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is surveying the industry. This survey seeks to gain a better perspective on the range of techniques financial institutions are developing to more robustly measure the risk these instruments entail. The information acquired in the survey is to be fully incorporated in supervisors' review of the current adequacy of the MRA. However, this effort to review the MRA is still in its early stages. As yet, it is uncertain whether the effort will result in minor revisions or significant changes to the current MRA. Challenges in securities accounting and auditing Both of these securities-accounting issues that I have just discussed should also be viewed in light of broader issues that are challenging corporate management, independent accountants, and regulators. Fair value accounting for securities, whether in the income statement or in disclosures, relies on key assumptions, modeling techniques and judgment. For example, modeling techniques are commonly used in valuing mortgage-backed securities. The present value of the estimated future net cash flows attempts to anticipate prepayments of mortgages due to forecasted changes in interest rates. Changes in the assumptions used in the modeling approach for any instrument or product will affect the resulting values. For example, if property values are rising rather than falling, the resulting buildup of home equity can affect a borrower's desire to refinance the loan or use the equity to purchase a more expensive home. Thus, the auditing of model-based fair values for accounting purposes requires a high level of specialized knowledge. The auditor must fully understand how modeling or other sophisticated techniques are used to determine fair value, whether the assumptions used in the models are appropriate, and whether the data have integrity. Furthermore, \"fair value\" is not always clearly defined or easily determined for some products or instruments. The lack of observable market prices, differences in modeling assumptions, expectations of future events and market conditions, and customer behavior make the task of assigning appropriate valuations very difficult. Certainly, a noncomplex instrument that is highly liquid and that has an observable market price is easier to value with more precision than a highly complex, illiquid instrument. Given the myriad of complex financial instruments that currently exist and that are constantly being created, developing verifiable and auditable fair value estimates is a major concern. And because fair value models are forward looking, an auditor has an additional challenge: determining what is the normal variability in expectations that surrounds any forecast and what is earnings manipulation. To its credit, FASB has recently issued an exposure draft on fair value measurement. The proposal provides a framework for fair value measurement objectives, and it is just the initial phase of a long-term fair value project. The initial phase is generally intended to apply to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are currently subject to fair value measurement and disclosure. It is not intended to expand the use of fair value measurements in financial statements at the present time. In my view, the proposal is a good first step in enhancing fair value measurement guidance, but I believe additional guidance is warranted. The proposal should address reliability issues more comprehensively. Most important, FASB should develop additional guidance and conduct more research and testing to enhance the reliability of fair value measurements before the use of fair value is significantly expanded in primary financial statements. Furthermore, FASB should work with other organizations including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and accounting firms to enable the development of robust guidance that ensures fair value estimates can be verified and audited. Anti-tying restrictions on banks Finally, I want to discuss the nature of anti-tying regulations for financial institutions, an issue that can be very confusing to nonbankers. As innovations create new financial instruments, services, and markets, and as banks expand the scope of the financial services they offer, the process banks use to make business decisions is similar to the process many of you apply in your own business. Financial institutions are trying to build customer loyalty by offering a broader menu of financial services to corporate customers. Some of these financial services are more profitable than others, and thus, add greater shareholder value. The concern addressed by anti-tying restrictions is that banks may force customers to take unwanted products in order to obtain needed services - primarily loan products. As a brief background, a special anti-tying statute applies to banks. The statute generally prohibits a bank from conditioning the availability or price of one product on a requirement that a customer also obtain another product that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate of the bank. For example, a bank may not inform a customer that it will provide the customer with a loan only if the customer engages the bank's securities affiliate for an underwriting or obtains some other product or service that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate. The words \"that is not a traditional bank product\" are important. Not all tying arrangements are illegal ties. The statute and the Federal Reserve Board's regulations expressly permit a bank to condition the availability or price of a product or service on a requirement that the customer also obtain one or more traditional bank products from the bank or an affiliate. For example, banks for DATE required customers obtaining construction financing to maintain compensating balances. A traditional bank product generally is defined as any \"loan, discount, deposit, or trust service,\" and the Board's proposed interpretation provides guidance on what types of products fall within the scope of these terms. In light of the complexities of the anti-tying restrictions, the Board has published and received public comment on both an interpretation of the anti-tying statute and on related supervisory guidance. The proposed interpretation was published to help banking organizations and corporate customers clarify permissible practices under this complex statute in DATE's financial services environment. Importantly, the interpretation proposes guidelines that a bank should follow when it seeks to engage in traditional \"relationship banking,\" that is, serving its customers on the basis of the profitability of the overall customer relationship with the entire banking organization. The proposed supervisory guidance communicates our expectations as to the types of policies, procedures, internal controls, and training programs that should help banks comply with the anti-tying restrictions. The proposed guidance also emphasizes the importance of the compliance and internal audit functions in ensuring compliance with the law and regulations. Ensuring compliance can be an extremely difficult endeavor because there is no prohibition against cross selling products or aggressive marketing. The goal is to ensure that banks don't cross the line between offering choices and illegally tying products and services. The Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have long required that banking organizations establish and maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-tying restrictions, and the agencies monitor these policies and procedures through the supervisory process. Admittedly, at times it can be difficult to determine whether a violation of the anti-tying statute has occurred. As I mentioned, some forms of tying by banks are expressly permitted, and the statute does not apply to tying arrangements imposed by a bank's nonbank affiliates. Moreover, divining whether a bank imposed a prohibited tie often requires a close review of the facts and circumstances associated with a particular transaction. A prohibited tie, for example, may be conveyed orally and not memorialized in transaction documentation. Our supervisory reviews indicate that banks generally understand and have implemented systems to ensure compliance with the anti-tying provisions to which they are subject. In addition, although we have encouraged customers that believe they have been the subject of an illegal tie to come forward, we have received few complaints from bank customers. Moreover, few customers have sought to challenge their banks directly, although they are granted a private right of action under the statute and may obtain triple damages if successful. A DATE report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on bank tying practices found that the available evidence did not substantiate claims that banks were engaging in illegal tying, but the report did note that borrowers were reluctant to file formal complaints. The GAO recommended that the Board consider taking additional steps to enforce compliance with the anti-tying provisions. Our proposed interpretation and guidance are intended to help banks and the customers understand this rather complex compliance area. I should mention that we also received a comment letter on the proposed interpretation from the Department of Justice. This letter, which is available on the Department's web site, expresses concern that the bank anti-tying statute itself may suppress competition and harm consumers, especially as it is applied to large customers. The Justice Department recommends that the Board interpret the bank anti-tying statute in a manner similar to the federal antitrust laws. Under federal antitrust laws, which apply to independent broker-dealers, a showing of market power is essential to support a finding that a company has coerced its customer to purchase an unwanted product or service. In contrast, the courts historically have found that the special anti-tying statute that applies only to banks generally does not require a showing of market power to support a violation. Alternatively, the department recommends that the Board exercise its statutory authority to exempt large, corporate customers from the reach of the bank anti-tying statute. These are all issues the Board will have to carefully consider as it moves toward finalizing the anti-tying interpretation and guidance. Conclusion I know that the SIA and your financial firms have been devoting time to many of the regulatory issues that have made the headlines in DATE. I hope that my comments DATE will also remind you that the evolution of the industry and financial products creates challenges that you are likely to encounter in the more normal course of business.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Sound capital and risk management Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the OpRisk USA NUM Conference, New York, DATE.    I would like to thank the sponsors of OpRisk USA for providing an opportunity for bankers, regulators, consultants, and other interested parties to share their perspectives on operational-risk management. DATE, I will speak about the importance of risk management and its relationship to capital. I will also touch on the broad objectives of effective operational-risk management and offer specific observations on some of the challenges of operational-risk quantification. In addition, I will describe the current status of the Basel II process. Importance of risk management Over DATE, we have witnessed substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry, particularly at our largest institutions. These very large entities have broad geographic reach, operate in many lines of business, and offer a wide array of complex products and services. The largest institutions have moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on the balance sheet and have adopted strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets and active management of risks. The risk-management techniques employed by banking organizations continue to improve and adapt to the ever-changing financial landscape. The Federal Reserve, in its role as both a bank supervisor and the nation's central bank, has an obvious interest in maintaining the stability of the banking industry and the financial system as a whole. We, along with our counterparts at the other U.S. bank and thrift regulatory agencies, are responsible for ensuring that banking institutions operate in a safe and sound manner and have strong capital levels. But with the advent of very large banking organizations that engage in a wide variety of business activities--some of them quite complex--the Federal Reserve has become even more interested in ensuring that banking organizations understand the risks of these activities. For their part, bankers continue to improve the risk-management and risk-measurement processes at their institutions, and regulators have supported these efforts. Banks themselves have created many of the new techniques to improve their risk management and internal economic capital measures in order to be more effective competitors and to control and manage their losses. By more clearly defining risk exposures and identifying the causes of and controls for their losses, bank management can more effectively integrate decisions about risk-taking into their strategic and tactical decisionmaking. Banks that integrate risk measurement into their business-line goals often find that this effort helps them to implement their strategic plans more effectively. Ideally, an institution should use a systematic approach to identify and measure its risk exposures; however, even the best processes for evaluating and measuring risk suffer if flawed data are used. To conduct a credible internal analysis of relevant risks, institutions should identify which risks can generally be quantified and which ones cannot. When risk measurements are based on scarce or incomplete data, or on unproven quantitative tools, institutions might need to use sensitivity analyses, stress tests, or scenario analyses to a greater extent in order to develop meaningful risk measures. Banks that wish to remain competitive must keep up with the latest developments in risk measurement and management. Bankers must ensure that their models keep up with current practice and continue to capture risks accurately, especially as new activities and new products are introduced. Similarly, the supervisory community needs to keep up with developments in banking and finance. We consider this vitally important because banking is and will remain a highly dynamic industry. Supervisors will have to pay attention to evolving sound practices and ensure that new regulations do not unduly inhibit banks from adopting new banking practices and financial instruments. Our focus on balancing developments in the industry with safe and sound operations at institutions is increasingly important, given the growing complexity, sophistication, and concentration of DATE's banking system. And with the advent of Basel II, which is intended to update capital rules for large, internationally active U.S. banking organizations, supervisors must become even more involved in understanding emerging sound practices in risk measurement and management. One of the most important sound practices for a banking organization is the tying of risk exposures to capital. Banks that use similar risk models can have very different risk exposures. That is why the Basel II approach to capital is so important. Basel II provides a framework in which the risk level banks choose to accept is reflected in their capital. Banks with higher loss exposures will be required to hold more capital than those who have lower risk appetites. This provides a strong relationship with risk management, in that returns earned in riskier business lines will necessarily be higher to cover the cost of the additional capital held. Operational-risk management Focusing now on operational risk, one of the most substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry in DATE is the movement of the largest organizations toward fee-based revenue streams. These new activities include securitizing loan portfolios, with the bank retaining responsibility for loan servicing; buying and selling financial instruments for customers; and other business lines that generate revenue by charging customers transaction and account processing fees. These activities generate little balance-sheet exposure, but they present the potential for large losses if the complex systems and financial deals associated with them are not managed in a sound manner. Operational risks are also becoming more important in the large, complex financial institution as more technology and automated processes are used in all areas of operations. When banks used manual processes, errors were confined to the limited area where the employee worked. But in a modern technology setting, factors such as breakdowns in controls, errors in software code, and processing stream interruptions can have enterprisewide effects on the performance of the organization. Recent history provides us with ample evidence that operational risk can be significant. Large financial institutions have reported operational losses from breakdowns in operating controls that, in some cases, have exceeded their credit- or market-related losses. In the area of legal risk, for example, many institutions have learned that failing to identify and promptly correct problems can result in losses that significantly exceed management's initial expectations. Over DATE, large financial institutions have experienced more than NUM operational loss events in excess of $NUM million each; some of these individual operational losses, resulting from fraud, rogue trading, and settlements stemming from questionable business practices, have exceeded $NUM billion. An effective operational-risk management framework, therefore, is essential for identifying and managing operational risks. As you know, analysts at the main rating agencies are placing increasing importance on operational risk when they assess a bank's credit ratings. We believe effective operational-risk management has both quantitative and qualitative components and that reliance on solely quantitative or solely qualitative approaches is no longer appropriate. What remains critically important is how these approaches are combined in the implementation of an effective process for identifying, measuring, managing, and controlling operational risk throughout an organization. Effective operational-risk measurement tools enable the executive management at the largest banking organizations to make better risk-and-return decisions, thereby enhancing the return on their institution's capital investments. By considering operational risk as part of their assessment of capital requirements and true profitability, corporate decisionmakers can better decide which business lines to invest in or shut down. The organization further benefits when operational-risk measurement is integrated with the management processes of individual business units, because this helps communicate risk-management issues to the business lines. The allocation of operational-risk capital to these units provides them with a financial incentive to reduce the chance of operational losses. Hard numbers, linked to specific risks, also allow business lines to more accurately price their products. Some banking organizations are already benefiting by factoring operational-risk measurement and management into pricing decisions, strategic planning processes, portfolio management activities, management reporting metrics, and decisions regarding incentive compensation. There are potential longer-term benefits as well, including: a reduction in operational losses as control weaknesses are identified and improved; fewer errors and breaks in customer service, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and retention; stronger information security and customer data privacy; higher credit ratings, and increased operational efficiency. One objective of Basel II is to enhance practices at our largest and most complex banking organizations for identifying operational risk exposures and ensuring that these exposures are appropriately supported by regulatory capital. Importantly, the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk under Basel II allows banks to use a framework that relies on their own qualifying methodologies for identifying operational-loss events and measuring risk exposure in order to determine their operational-risk regulatory capital requirements. In this way, the AMA gives banks the flexibility to continue developing and incorporating evolving sound practices for operational-risk measurement and management into their AMA frameworks. Challenges to operational-risk quantification under Basel II In the context of Basel II, it has often been argued that measuring operational risk is much more difficult than measuring market or credit risk; however, any model intended to capture unexpected loss has its challenges. For example, market-risk models can be violated when the price of financial products moves in a way that is outside of the historical norm. Credit-risk models need to consider downturn estimates for loss given default, which can depend on the severity of the economic downturn and the price of collateral. Similarly, operational-risk models need to address potential losses that may not have occurred during the short period that most institutions have been collecting internal operational-loss data. This absence of a robust time series of internal operational-loss data is one factor that makes operational-risk modeling particularly challenging. To address the difficulties presented by the very nature of operational risk, the designers of operational-risk measurement frameworks have had to be innovative. For example, we have seen frameworks that use scenario analyses, risk self-assessments, and the judgment of senior business managers in innovative ways. We have also seen creativity in the melding of internal and external loss data to guide thinking about internal loss exposures. Perhaps most significantly, we have seen some truly innovative thinking about ways to integrate operational-risk measurement into the broader framework of operational-risk management. I would like to offer some specific observations on a couple of key challenges relating to operationalrisk quantification. First, with respect to operational-loss data, Basel II banks face the challenge of establishing credible operational-loss databases that they can use in determining their regulatory capital requirement for operational risk. The advanced approaches under Basel II create a link between regulatory capital and risk management. Banks using an AMA for operational risk will be required to adopt more-formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management procedures and processes. For example, Basel II establishes standards for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. These standards are consistent with broader supervisory expectations that high-quality risk management at large complex organizations depends on credible data--and not just for Basel II. Data are needed for all models and risk measures used in financial services, including credit-scoring models, market-based measures such as KMV, and value-at-risk and other economic capital models. The emphasis in Basel II on improved data standards, therefore, should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital standards but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices that will strengthen the value of the banking franchise. As I mentioned earlier, regulators view capital from the perspective of ensuring safety and soundness in the financial system. But individual financial institutions generally focus on capital, in particular economic capital, as a means for evaluating the profitability of their activities, defining their risk appetite, and setting risk limits. Although the goals differ, there are important linkages between firms' efforts to quantify operational-risk capital for regulatory capital purposes and for strategic decisionmaking. To the extent the operational-loss data considered in banks' internal economic capital models appropriately reflect the banks' risk exposures, banks should be able to leverage their economic capital data collection efforts to measure their operational-risk exposure under an AMA. This leverage is also consistent with the Basel II objective of better aligning regulatory capital with banks' internal economic capital. The second challenge I wanted to touch on is banks' integration of insurance in their processes for quantifying operational risk. As many of you are aware, Basel II contains a provision whereby banks using an advanced measurement approach for operational risk could adjust their calculated operational-risk exposure to reflect reductions due to operational-risk mitigants, such as insurance, subject to certain limitations. According to the Basel II framework, a bank's risk-mitigation calculations must reflect the bank's insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the bank's overall determination of its operational-risk capital. To the extent banks want to reduce their operational-risk capital charge through the use of insurance, banks must analyze and demonstrate the relationship between specific losses and the ability to collect from the insurer. At the time of the Loss Data Collection Exercise, banks that incorporated insurance benefits into their operational risk capital calculations appeared to do so through an ex-post adjustment to their capital figure in the aggregate, rather than by embedding the specific effects of insurance into the AMA modeling process itself. We expect operational risk managers to work closely with their insurance managers to make better decisions about insurance coverage. This should include clear communication of the nature of individual loss exposures and consideration of the availability of insurance coverage for particular risks. While work remains for those banks that are building their AMA frameworks, we have seen, and continue to see, significant progress in these AMA development efforts. One indication of this progress can be seen in the results of the Loss Data Collection Exercise. This exercise resulted in the submission of over one million internal operational-loss event observations by participating institutions. As you know, internal loss-event data are a key input for determining an institution's regulatory capital requirement for operational risk. These data have provided the agencies with invaluable insights about the comprehensiveness of data at individual institutions. The agencies have provided feedback to participating institutions that should help them in their continuing AMA development efforts. In addition, the agencies continue to analyze the loss data in an effort to provide the industry with additional insights relating to operational-risk quantification. Proposed revisions to regulatory capital regime I have referred to certain parts of the Basel II framework in my remarks so far, mostly relating to operational risk and the AMA. Now I would like to give a brief update on where we stand with implementing Basel II in the United States, as well as with amending the current Basel I regime. First of all, you may have heard that DATE the Federal Reserve Board plans to review a draft of the interagency Basel II notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) at a public meeting, meaning that a draft NPR will also be made available to the public at that time. The final NPR is expected to be issued in the Federal Register after all of the U.S. banking agencies complete their review and approval processes, meaning it will then be \"officially\" out for comment. We are pleased that the agencies have reached agreement on the draft NPR, since, as you know, we have spent substantial time and considerable effort on the document. We also recognize the extent to which the industry, Congress, and others have anticipated the release of this document--and the greater detail it contains about Basel II in the United States. Of course, we look forward to hearing feedback on the NPR. Your comments and those from others will contribute importantly to the assessment of Basel II objectives and its implementation, and will help us as we develop the framework further. Reasons for pursuing Basel II I think it is helpful, as we anticipate release of the NPR, to review the reasons we are developing U.S. proposals for Basel II. The current Basel I capital framework, adopted DATE, has served us well but has become increasingly inadequate for large, internationally active banks offering ever-more complex and sophisticated products and services. We need a revised capital framework for these banks, and we believe that Basel II is such a framework. One of the major ways in which Basel II should improve safety and soundness is by more closely linking capital requirements to risk. The current Basel I measures are not very risk sensitive and do not provide meaningful measures to bankers, supervisors, or the marketplace for complex banking organizations. Under Basel I, it is possible for two banks with dramatically different risk profiles to have the same minimum capital requirement, and a bank's capital requirement does not reflect deterioration in asset quality. In addition, the balance-sheet focus of Basel I does not adequately capture risks of certain off-balance-sheet transactions and fee-based activity--for example, the operational risk embedded in the services from which many large U.S. institutions generate a good portion of their revenues. In addition to enhancing the meaningfulness of regulatory capital measures, Basel II should make the financial system safer by substantially improving risk management at banks. Basel II builds on the riskmanagement approaches of well-managed banks and creates incentives for banks to move toward leading risk-measurement and risk-management practices; we have already seen some progress in risk management at many institutions in the United States and around the globe as a result of discussions about and preparations for Basel II. The new framework is also much more consistent with the internal capital measures that institutions use to manage their business. Basel II can also provide supervisors with a more conceptually consistent and more transparent framework for assessing the linkage of risk and capital over time at our most complex institutions; identifying which institutions have deficiencies; and, ultimately, evaluating systemic risk in the banking system. Therefore, Basel II establishes a more coherent relationship between how supervisors assess regulatory capital and how they supervise the banks, enabling examiners to better evaluate whether banks are holding prudent capital levels, given their risk profiles, and to better understand differences across institutions. Compared with the current framework, Basel II is more able to accommodate new products and transaction types and to provide meaningful capital measures for the risks embedded therein. As the central bank and the supervisor of banks, bank holding companies, and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Basel II framework delivers a strong and risk-sensitive base of capital. That is why we support safeguards to ensure strong capital levels during the transition to Basel II, and why we will remain vigilant in monitoring the ongoing impact of and Basel II. This means that during after the transition to Basel II, supervisors will rely on ongoing, detailed analyses to continuously evaluate the results of the new framework and ensure prudent levels of capital. To be quite clear, the Federal Reserve believes that strong capital is fundamentally important to the health of our banking system. We believe Basel II will be a strong contributor to our tradition of ensuring that U.S. banks maintain capital levels that provide an appropriate cushion against risk-taking. As we have stated before, we will continue to use existing prudential measures to complement Basel II. For example, the current leverage ratio requirement--a ratio of capital to total assets--will remain unchanged for all banks, whether or not they are subject to the Basel II framework. Also, supervisors will continue to enforce existing prompt-corrective-action-requirements in response to declines in capital. Both the leverage ratio and prompt corrective action are fully consistent with Basel II. Proposed amendments to Basel I Before I end my remarks about regulatory capital, I would like to offer some thoughts about ongoing efforts to revise existing regulatory capital rules, known as Basel I. First of all, we expect only one or two dozen banks to move to Basel II in the near term. That is, the vast majority of U.S. banks would be able to continue operating safely and soundly under Basel I, as it is amended through the rulemaking process. The Basel I framework already has been amended more than twenty times in response to changes in the banking industry and a better understanding of the risks in individual products and services. The agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to amend the Basel I rules. Concerns have been raised about potential competitive inequities between Basel II banks and Basel I banks. We take these concerns seriously. In an effort to mitigate those concerns, regulators have proposed changes to enhance the risk sensitivity of U.S. Basel I rules and remain vigilant about potential competitive distortions that might be created by introducing Basel II rules. We are also mindful that amendments to Basel I should not be too complex or too burdensome for the multitude of smaller banks to which the revised rules will apply. Additionally, we recognize the need to have full transparency about Basel II proposals and proposed Basel I amendments. Accordingly, we expect to have overlapping comment periods for both the Basel II NPR and the proposed Basel I amendments. The intent is to allow banks and others to review both NPRs before both sets of rules are finalized. In that way, bankers from potential opt-in institutions and from those not planning to move to Basel II can evaluate the potential impact of Basel II in light of the proposed Basel I amendments. In fact, we want all interested parties to compare, contrast, and comment on the two proposals in overlapping time frames. At this point, we are still reviewing the comments received on the ANPR for amendments to Basel I (the comment period ended in DATE). The agencies are developing their proposals for Basel I amendments, on the basis of comments received, and hope to have a Basel I NPR DATE. Conclusion As prudent supervisors, we need to ensure that banks have strong capital levels--whether banks operate under our current rules, revisions to our current rules, or Basel II. Our focus will continue to be on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate for operations of each institution and that those risk systems operate effectively. Our challenge as regulators is to work with the industry in developing an effective capital framework. We envision Basel II as a significant step toward a more risk-sensitive capital framework.

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: The proposed U.S. approach to regulatory capital - an update Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the conference on The Changing Regulatory Capital Regime in Europe: A Challenging New Business Concept, Brussels, Belgium (via videoconference), DATE.    Good TIME. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to join you at this impressive conference. You asked me to provide some thoughts about Basel II, particularly its application in the United States. Before doing that, I would like to inform you of our progress in developing the new accord. As most of you know, we are in a very important stage of the process. Over DATE there have been some crucial developments as a result of the discussions among member regulators, a demonstration once again of the Basel Committee's determination to listen to comments and make those modifications necessary to deliver the best accord possible. The proposal for a capital standard based on unexpected losses submitted by the committee for public comment is a good example of this earnestness in seeking an improved final product. Other issues are still being discussed, including securitization, retail credit, and credit risk mitigation. One should not forget that, on a parallel track, member countries still have to complete their own domestic efforts to translate the accord into national regulation. As you probably know, the comment period for the initial U.S. proposal for Basel II - known as the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) - just ended DATE. U.S. supervisors are reviewing the comments carefully. If supportable arguments are given for further accord alterations, we will develop proposed changes to present to our colleagues on the committee. In the United States, after this next round of discussions there will still be additional procedural steps before a final rule is in place, with opportunity for comment at each stage. To be clear, the need for more procedural steps in the United States should not be taken as an indication of our lack of commitment to the Basel process. Rather, it is a sign of our attempt to develop these proposals on as transparent a basis as possible and to hear a wide range of comments. The Congress of the United States has also held hearings on the development of the new accord. The interest and oversight by our Congress in these discussions is appropriate and welcome, particularly for an undertaking as extensive as Basel II. The U.S. regulators appreciate the fact that we are able to operate as independent agencies but also realize that we have an obligation to keep the elected representatives informed of our progress in this major effort. Of course, it is expected that other countries and the European Union will be following their own procedures as well. Overall, I have been impressed by the efficacy of the comment process and believe it offers an open forum for all parties to voice their opinions. Debate and discussion on such an important undertaking are essential, and - if solid and convincing arguments are put forth - provide a real opportunity for enhancements to the final product. The current proposal is better because the comments have elicited good ideas that have been taken seriously. Future comments based on sound thought and evidence will create further modifications. But I must say that simple assertions will not carry very much weight. At the same time, we do need to ensure that momentum is maintained. In DATE, the committee members committed to work promptly to resolve outstanding issues by DATE. In DATE, the Basel Committee will meet to address further analysis of outstanding issues and review the timetable for completing and implementing the committee's work on the accord. Using the agreement reached in the committee as a template, U.S. supervisors then plan to conduct another Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) to gauge more clearly the impact of the Basel proposals. We believe it is critical that we carefully test the new proposal to determine its effects on individual institutions and to ascertain the need to fine-tune the proposal further, a process that could include recalibrating some of the risk-weight functions. It is our sense that other countries will be doing the same. Because timing is a function of the degree of changes required by the QIS, the U.S. agencies will then conduct a full notice of proposed rulemaking once again to seek and then evaluate public comments before adopting a final rule. U.S. proposals for Basel II Against that background, let me turn to a number of topics that some have raised about Basel II. The U.S. banking agencies have, as you know, proposed to implement Basel II somewhat differently than other nations have. These differences are perfectly consistent with the spirit and letter of the proposal, and reflect the particular characteristics of the U.S. banking system and the rules and regulations under which it operates. While our approach is best for the United States, it is not necessarily best for other nations. The U.S. banking agencies propose that only the most advanced approaches under Basel II be offered for banking organizations in the United States: the advanced internal ratings-based approach for credit risk, known as A-IRB, and the advanced measurement approach for operational risk, known as AMA. As indicated in the ANPR, the standardized approach and the foundation IRB approach to Basel II would not be permitted for credit risk. Nor would the basic indicator approach or standardized approach be available for operational risk. The banking agencies took considerable time to develop the advanced proposals, which we believed would clearly be the best option for the U.S. banking system. The complex operations of the largest banks have outgrown the existing capital regime, and for them Basel I has become less and less effective. Indeed, in the view of U.S. supervisors, an overhaul of the regulatory capital system for our largest banks would be worthwhile only if the most advanced approaches were used. Because of the heterogeneous nature of the U.S. banking system, some balance in the application of Basel II would be necessary. On the one hand, the size, scale and complexity of the internationally active U.S. banks requires, in the opinion of the U.S. supervisors, that these entities operate with the best feasible risk measurement and management procedures, and these procedures are most consistent with the advanced versions of Basel II. On the other hand, the U.S. agencies do not want to impose the higher costs of the advanced version of Basel II on institutions for which it is clearly not suited. In the end, the U.S. banking agencies tried to allow as much choice as possible, while ensuring that banks are still meeting domestic regulatory obligations, avoiding private-sector costs that do not produce some clear and convincing level of benefits, abiding by the evolving Basel II agreement, and, most important, maintaining a safe and sound U.S. banking system. The U.S. banks that would be required to adopt Basel II, as well as those that we expect to choose or opt in to the new regulatory capital rules, are those that, because of size and complexity, should operate with the most sophisticated risk-management practices. The ANPR lays out objective criteria, including asset size and foreign exposure, to identify the large, internationally active banks that would be considered mandatory banks. Naturally, there are also thousands of banks in the United States that do not qualify as large and internationally active and for which the advanced approach of Basel II may not necessarily be appropriate. The overwhelming majority of these banks are significantly less complex and have a scale of operations and market that generally does not extend beyond the United States. As I will discuss, these entities need not be covered by the revised accord to meet international obligations or our own regulatory responsibilities. Thus, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed that those banks not operating under Basel II advanced approaches would remain under the current U.S. regulatory capital rules. An important factor in our decision to retain the current capital regime for those entities that are neither large nor significant global competitors is the scale and nature of the existing capital regime in the United States. The U.S. supervisory regime already contains the substantial elements of Pillar Two under Basel II, including evaluations of internal capital adequacy processes. U.S. supervisors have for DATE conducted extensive and thorough on-site supervisory reviews, a process which we believe has contributed to a sound banking and financial system. In addition, the culture of disclosure within the United States already comes close to, and in some areas exceeds, the Pillar Three requirements of the accord revisions. For those U.S. institutions with public debt or equity, requirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as demands by the market, translate into fairly extensive public disclosure. Moreover, these small and medium-sized banks for the most part already hold capital well in excess of the supervisory minima under both the current and proposed capital regimes. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of U.S. banks maintain capital above the well-capitalized criteria of NUM percent of risk-weighted assets under the U.S. prompt corrective action rules, and generally the smaller the bank, the larger the proportionate capital cushion. Nearly NUM percent of all small and medium-sized banks have regulatory capital ratios of at least NUM percent, and thus it is likely that their current ratios would essentially meet or surpass proposed requirements under Basel II. Therefore, we believe that the current approach to determining regulatory minimum capital in the United States is at least as prudent as Basel II. While U.S. supervisors see no need to require Basel II for banks not considered large or internationally active, the proposal would allow any bank to adopt the accord revisions if it so desired. Of course, any bank wishing to adopt Basel II would have to meet the same high standards applied to mandatory institutions, particularly the internal measurement and management of risk for its exposures. For some large nonmandatory regional institutions, moving to Basel II may be a good choice, and we anticipate that at least ten, and perhaps more, may do so. In effect, the approach proposed in the United States requires that those institutions that would not be required by scale or global activities to adopt the A-IRB version of Basel II would have to conduct their own cost-benefit analysis to determine if they should opt in or wait, perhaps for the costs of implementation to come down through vendor and other developments, or, alternatively, if they should remain under the current capital regime. Initially, some of our colleagues on the Basel Supervisors' Committee criticized the U.S. agencies' approach to scope of application, claiming that the application was too limited or inconsistent with the proposed accord. But this criticism has faded with better understanding of the structure of the U.S. banking system: More than two-thirds of the assets of U.S. banking organizations are likely to be covered by Basel II, as well as more than NUM percent of the foreign claims held by U.S. banking organizations. Potential competitive effects The U.S. agencies have increasingly focused on the potential competitive effects of Basel II on U.S. banks. As the ANPR outlines, policymakers will be attentive to the competitive concerns of both the institutions expected to adopt Basel II in the United States, and those that might not. We are of course interested in the evidence developed from the ANPR. In addition, Fed staff members are now conducting empirical research to try to determine if the bifurcated approach has any implications for possible acquisition strategies to be used by advanced Basel II banks in acquiring non-Basel II banks. Moreover, we are also trying to determine empirically the evidence for the competitive implications of the U.S. implementation proposals on credit for small and medium-sized business, residential mortgage, and credit card markets. If that empirical evidence indicates a high probability of general competitive imbalances, we will then review our options for addressing the problem. But we first need to see the evidence that a problem exists and then determine how large it may be. That these issues surfaced, I might add, illustrates the benefits of a transparent comment period. Standards for Basel II One would hope that, by now, no one misunderstands the extensive requirements for any institution adopting Basel II, particularly for the advanced approaches that will be the only option in the United States. Because capital requirements under the advanced approaches will be based on bank inputs, the bar will clearly have to be raised, particularly for risk management and control systems. For most banks - in fact, I would say for all banks moving to the advanced versions of Basel II - meeting these standards and requirements will be very challenging and will require substantial resources. Managers at some institutions may believe that their institution is already very close to meeting all the prerequisites for Basel II. Although our rules and standards are not yet final, on the basis of pilot reviews and discussions with line supervisors here in the United States, I would advise any institution thinking it has little work remaining to make a careful and frank reassessment of where it stands. In the United States we are developing a set of supervisory guidance to accompany our rulemaking. This supervisory guidance, which will be developed for all A-IRB credit portfolios of Basel II as well as for the AMA, is intended to provide additional clarity and interpretation of the rule, and to more clearly define supervisory expectations. And the guidance, by describing in more detail what it will take to satisfy U.S. supervisors, should assist nonmandatory banks in deciding whether to opt in. Initial drafts of supervisory guidance for corporate A-IRB and for AMA were published for comment in concert with the ANPR. U.S. regulators are already reviewing feedback on this draft supervisory guidance and, as with the ANPR, remain open to suggestions for altering that guidance if we are presented with valid arguments for doing so. Draft guidance for other A-IRB portfolios, such as retail, is being developed and will be published for comment as well. This is also a good opportunity for me to add a few initial thoughts about the possible nature of qualifying examinations for Basel II in the United States. As I noted, we still need to reach an agreement in Basel and complete the process for formulating a final rule in the United States before we can start assessing institutions vis-à-vis new standards related to Basel II. However, the U.S. agencies are starting to identify, on a joint basis, what a qualification process for Basel II would encompass, both for mandatory and opt-in banking organizations. This will not be an easy task, in part because our particular regulatory structure has different supervisors overseeing different banks and legal entity types. And it will be complicated by the need to coordinate qualification internationally with host jurisdictions to minimize the burden on banking organizations supervised by agencies from multiple countries. Cooperation among the U.S. agencies on this and other matters relating to Basel II implementation has been excellent. There is, of course, no expectation that under Basel II the U.S. regulatory structure will change in terms of the legal mandates assigned to each agency. As the ANPR states, an institution's primary federal supervisor would have responsibility for determining an institution's readiness for an advanced approach and ultimately would be responsible, after consultation with other relevant supervisors, for determining whether the institution satisfies the supervisory expectations for the advanced approaches. And this procedure will obviously apply at both the bank and bank holding company level in the United States. Given the significance of Basel II, enhanced communication and cooperation among U.S. supervisory agencies - and between U.S. supervisors and affected host country supervisors - will be necessary. We are already in agreement that the U.S. qualification process will be intensive, rigorous, and lengthy, because of the nature of what we are about to embark upon. But in the end we believe that a rigorous qualification process will create a more risk-sensitive regulatory capital regime and improve risk management. Cross-border issues The accord revisions wisely contain a certain amount of flexibility to account for differences in the banking systems of member countries. These so-called national discretion elements, combined with different approaches that member countries might choose for their banking system, mean that maintaining a level playing field across countries is a challenge. Achieving an acceptable level of consistency in implementation is something that the Basel Committee takes seriously and is the reason it formed the Accord Implementation Group (AIG) DATE. The AIG comprises line supervisors from member countries and is charged with identifying potential implementation issues and creating as much consistency as possible across countries. These issues, which are referred to as \"cross border\" or \"home/host\" issues, cover both credit and operational risk. Cross-border issues are particularly complicated because the new accord will apply to both consolidated banking organizations in home countries as well as subsidiary bank and bank holding companies in host countries. DATE the AIG issued a set of high-level principles for cross-border implementation of the accord. These principles lay the groundwork for further cooperation and coordination for implementation among member countries. They clearly identify the need to respect both home and host country rules and regulations, the need for enhanced and pragmatic cooperation between both types of supervisors, and the desire for supervisors to minimize the burden on banking groups as much as possible. The U.S. agencies believe that their choice for scope of application is consistent with these principles. For example, the proposal to allow only the advanced approaches in the United States also extends to any U.S. banking subsidiaries of foreign banking organizations and reflects our legitimate role as host country supervisors and the principles of national treatment. At the same time, we understand that other countries may offer approaches that are different from those offered in the United States. So a consolidated banking organization not based in the United States may choose to operate under an approach not offered in our country - such as foundation IRB for credit risk or basic indicator for operational risk - even though the advanced approaches would be the only ones available to its U.S. bank and bank holding company subsidiaries. And if those U.S. subsidiaries are not considered mandatory Basel II institutions, they also have the option of remaining on the current U.S. regulatory capital regime. By the same logic, foreign banking subsidiaries of U.S.-based organizations would have to abide by the local rules and regulations of host country supervisors, even if their consolidated entity is operating under different rules. These differences between approaches offered in host versus home countries present challenges for global banking organizations, both foreign-based and U.S.-based. As a result, U.S. supervisors need to work very closely with supervisors from other member countries to assist banking organizations in meeting the various requirements. The AIG has already begun to foster this type of collaboration. For this issue the bottom line is that legal mandates across countries are not going to change, and supervisors realize that they have an added responsibility to keep complexity to a minimum. One of the most challenging home/host issues that has arisen of late is the allocation of operational risk capital within a consolidated banking organization. This issue, similar to other cross-border issues, goes right to the heart of home/host supervision. The conflict arises because host supervisors may require subsidiary banks at the local level to hold a certain amount of capital which, when aggregated across both geography and entity type, may be greater than what the consolidated organization deems necessary, because of diversification effects. This is clearly a difficult issue. As Chairman Caruana commented DATE, it may well take some time for our efforts to converge to an acceptable solution in this matter, and that solution may not be completely satisfactory for all parties. Right now the AIG is working with the Committee's Risk Management Group (RMG) to develop a set of possible solutions to the problem. My expectation is that reaching a solution will require a slow and steady effort, but in the end, we will reach an acceptable compromise. In that sense, this issue reflects much of what the Basel II process is all about - identifying challenging issues, listening carefully to comments, conducting analysis to find a range of possible options, and then reaching an acceptable compromise solution that is consistent with safety and soundness. Finally, I would like to turn to the AIG's work on consistency of standards. Because member countries have different supervisory regimes, there is the possibility for Basel II rules to be applied in a variety of ways. While some variety in standards across countries may be unavoidable, we believe that maintaining as much consistency as possible is a worthwhile objective. It benefits no one if there is an appearance that countries vary considerably in their application of standards. The entire accord is undermined if a set of banks from one country appears to be subject to softer standards. We are already happy with the progress we have seen within the AIG on this issue and believe that pursuing the goal of consistent standards will truly bring about a better and safer global banking system. Concluding thoughts I thank you for the opportunity to share some of my thoughts on Basel II. As I stated, I consider the recent decisions reached by the Basel Committee to be a very good example of how supportable and valid arguments for alterations in the accord proposals are taken seriously. In the United States, additional opportunities still remain for comments to be heard and for possible modifications as the United States continues its rulemaking processes. That said, we do not expect to slacken the high standards expected of banks operating under the advanced approaches for Basel II. The U.S. agencies have tailored the application of Basel II to the particular characteristics of the U.S. banking system, while maintaining both the letter and spirit of the accord. We expect other countries to act similarly with regard to their own banking systems. We understand that a number of cross-border issues relating to Basel II implementation pose challenges, and that it may take some time to resolve them. This will of course mean that supervisors across countries must work even more closely together. But I hope it is evident that the fervent efforts among member countries to heed comments and to find solutions underscore our commitment to craft the best accord revisions possible, while maintaining a safe and sound global banking system.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Linkages between internal capital measures and regulatory capital requirements Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the International Center for Business Information's Risk Management Conference: Basel Summit, Geneva, DATE.    I thank you for the invitation to speak at this impressive conference and am honored to have the opportunity to start the program. I believe that conferences such as this provide an excellent forum for regulators, bankers, academics, and other practitioners to share ideas, discuss outstanding issues, and learn from one another. I particularly appreciate the opportunity to talk with those of you in the industry, listen to your views, and hear about your experiences. Today I would like to discuss the linkage between internal capital measures and regulatory capital requirements and give you some insights into the lessons learned in the United States from the fourth Quantitative Impact Study--known as DATE. Importance of capital in the banking business I would like to begin by offering some general thoughts about the importance of capital and its linkage to risks. From a regulatory perspective, capital is obviously an invaluable support for the safety and soundness of our banking system. One can point to many historical examples in which countries' banking and financial systems suffered due to inadequate capital during times of stress. But I think you would all agree that not just the regulators see the importance of capital. Most bank customers, investors, counterparties and rating agencies would agree that capital provides an important backstop against risk-taking. Generally, economic models of capital are tied to unexpected losses. The assumption is that expected losses in the ordinary course of business should be covered by normal operating earnings. For losses beyond the normal range of expectations, sufficient capital should be in place to absorb the loss and leave the financial institution stable and able to continue operating effectively. Thus, financial institutions and lines of business with weaker profit margins or greater range of loss possibilities should have more capital. It is important here to distinguish between higher expected losses, for which bankers raise prices to cover risks, and higher unexpected losses, which require additional capital. Indeed, bankers continue to improve the risk-management and -measurement processes at their institutions, and regulators have been supportive of these efforts. Management--by more clearly defining risk exposures, drivers of losses, and mitigants of loss--can more effectively integrate decisions about risk-taking into their strategic and tactical decisionmaking. Banks that integrate risk measurement into business-line goals believe that it has improved the effective implementation of strategic plans. Managers \"compete\" for capital by demonstrating that the risk-adjusted returns in their line of business are more attractive than other alternatives. Tying capital to risks One of the questions regulators have been asked as we work toward implementing Basel II is whether we can just continue to encourage the improvement in risk modeling at banks and stop there, i.e., not tie risk models to capital. While improvements in the methodology of risk models and the transparency of better risk modeling in business decisionmaking are very useful, I believe we cannot stop there. Banks that have similar models of risk can have very different inherent levels of risk. That is, each institution has to decide what level of risk it is willing to accept to run its business. Some organizations are willing to take on much greater levels of risk than others. Some lines of business and some products are inherently riskier than others, while some organizations may be more adverse to accept risk than others. For safety and soundness reasons, bank supervisors must be sure that a bank with greater exposure to riskier lines of business, products, and customers holds more capital than a bank that is more risk adverse and designs its business plan to minimize risk taking. That is, just looking at risk models and not tying capital to the measured risk exposures does not provide the backstop that supervisors need to ensure that each institution has the appropriate capital in place before the unexpected loss occurs. Capital should be based on risk exposures, and the evolving risk modeling methodologies provide improved tools to better determine the appropriate level of capital. Let me add a point about the differences between minimum regulatory capital, as set out in Basel I, Basel II, or any supervisory model, and the level of capital that banks may choose to hold for business reasons. In almost all cases, banks hold capital above the regulatory minimum. Sometimes markets and customers demand a stronger credit rating at the bank than that implied by a minimum capital framework. Many banks also want to remain prepared to promptly pursue mergers and new business expansion opportunities as they arise, which requires capital above the regulatory minimum. They might also wish to hold additional capital if there are concerns about their ability to raise it in future periods. Such justifications for holding capital above regulatory minimums are entirely appropriate, indeed necessary, for determining the appropriate level of capital for an individual institution. Ideally, an institution should use a systematic process to assess its internal capital needs, one that takes a holistic approach to the firm's risks and complements its regulatory capital measures. As many of you know, the Federal Reserve has had, for DATE, a program to foster our largest, most complex banks' ability to assess internal capital needs. We believe that our discussions with bankers over DATE have improved the manner in which institutions determine the amount of capital they should hold, as well as helped improve their risk-measurement and risk-management practices. Identifying and measuring relevant risks In discussions with institutions, we see that successful internal capital processes emphasize the need to identify and measure all relevant risks. Obviously, these include credit, market, and operational risk, but also encompass certain other risk types--such as liquidity, interest rate, strategic, and legal risks. These \"other\" risks might indeed be the most relevant ones for certain institutions. In addition, institutions should be mindful of the difficulty in evaluating risks embedded in new products, instruments, and services; I would point to the potential risks associated with new mortgage products as one example. In conducting a credible internal analysis of relevant risks, institutions should identify those that are generally able to be quantified, and that are those not. Even the best processes for evaluating and measuring risk suffer if the data used are flawed. For those cases in which measurements of risk are based on scarce or incomplete data, or unproven quantitative tools, institutions might arrive at their measure of risk through a greater use of sensitivity analysis, stress tests, or scenario analysis. Determining appropriate capital levels Obviously, one should not simply stop at risk identification: Risk exposures should be tied to capital. The manner in which this is done should be well documented and updated regularly for appropriateness and relevance. Successful institutions pay particular attention to the need to maintain additional capital beyond what is suggested by quantitative or other measures--both for individual activities as well as in the aggregate. Most institutions maintain a \"cushion\" above internally generated capital measures to account for the vicissitudes of real life not necessarily captured in models. Additionally, management should remember that assumptions may become dated, leading to mismeasurement or misunderstanding of risks and the capital needed to support them. Institutions should also evaluate whether their long-run capital targets might differ from short-run goals, based on current and planned changes in risk profiles and the recognition that accommodating new capital needs can require significant lead time. Successful institutions have contingency plans, based on stress-test outcomes, to address potential capital shortfalls or liquidity and funding issues. Controls and oversight As this audience knows well, good risk management is more than just having high-quality data and sophisticated quantitative tools. Control and oversight mechanisms are vital elements of assessing internal capital needs. As prudent supervisors, we require any organization with complex risk profiles, for example those employing sophisticated financial practices or using complex financial instruments, to have a governance and control structure commensurate with those activities. That is, senior management of the bank should set appropriate limits in line with the risk appetite set by the board of directors, and communicate them to line staff. Management should also design and implement effective internal controls and have a robust process for monitoring exposures. Standards should be just as high in this area as they are for risk measurement and data maintenance. For if banks do not create an appropriate environment in which their quantitative risk measures and associated models are used--in other words, if an institution considers internal controls to be just a checklist--risk measures will not provide the performance the bank hopes to achieve. Indeed, in my work as a banker, I realized that effective measurement and management of risks usually can only be achieved within a management culture that sees risk management as the responsibility of line management across the institution and encourages more than just capital calculations. Keeping pace with developments in risk management The rapid developments in finance, technology, and information systems have provided tremendous benefits to customers and raised the productivity of banking institutions. These innovations also contribute to financial stability more broadly. Keeping up with the latest developments in risk measurement and risk management is a considerable challenge--indeed a necessity--for institutions wishing to remain in business. Bankers must ensure that the models keep up with current practice and continue to capture risks accurately, especially as new activities and new products are introduced. Sometimes a change in a product or activity may expose an institution to new or different risks--the exotic new residential mortgages products in the United States are a good example. The supervisory community also needs to keep up with developments in banking and finance. We consider this vitally important because banking will remain a highly dynamic industry. Supervisors will have to be attentive to changing sound practices and ensure that new regulations do not unduly inhibit adoption of new banking practices and financial instruments. Our focus in this area is even more important as banking becomes increasingly complex and sophisticated and as banking systems become more concentrated. And with the advent of Basel II, supervisors are becoming even more involved in understanding the emerging best practices in risk measurement and management. Bridging the gap between internal capital measures and regulatory capital As I alluded, supervisors are focused on setting minimum levels of regulatory capital at individual banks that is sufficient for safety and soundness in the institution and the banking system more broadly. Successful individual financial institutions, on the other hand, generally strive for a higher level of capital that is tied to their individual circumstances and allows them to effectively implement their business strategies. As a result, the capital goals of supervisors and institutions are not necessarily identical (nor should they be)--but they are complementary. Even though the capital goals of regulators and bankers may differ, supervisors can still use the internal information produced by large, complex institutions to augment the risk-sensitivity and overall meaningfulness of regulatory capital measures. Basel II--particularly the advanced approaches--is an attempt to do just that. Increasingly, the measures produced by Basel I are no longer accurate representations of the risks to which large, complex institutions are exposed. These institutions have moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on the balance sheet to strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets and active management of risks. They have significant, complicated exposures off the books that need to be considered more explicitly in determining minimum regulatory capital. Among these are operational risks, which in some recent instances have been the source of substantial losses far exceeding credit- or market-related losses. Basel II, by tying regulatory capital to bank inputs, offers greater transparency about what stands behind the inputs provided by banks and exactly how they are calculated. As I noted earlier, successful institutions understand that calculating internal capital measures is a serious and challenging undertaking, with many moving parts. Supervisors, through their analysis of bank inputs to Basel II, will develop an even better assessment of institutions' risk-measurement and riskmanagement practices. Furthermore, the added transparency in Pillar NUM disclosures is expected to provide market participants with a better understanding of an institution's risks and its ability to manage them. Perhaps most importantly, Basel II's advanced approaches create a link between regulatory capital and risk management. Under these approaches, banks will be required to adopt more formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management procedures and processes. The new Accord's emphasis on improved risk management should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital standards, but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices to benefit the institution more broadly. While the new framework would, in our view, provide useful incentives for institutions to accelerate the improvement of risk management, we believe that in most areas of risk management institutions would retain their ability to choose among which specific methods they employ. In other words, we expect the standards in Basel II to be met in a number of ways, not just one. Supervisors will work to define an acceptable range of practice within which several types of bank approaches and methodologies could be used. Importantly, as risk-management practices improve over time, supervisors can assess each new innovation to see whether it indeed fits within the range of acceptable practice. And those innovations should, in turn, improve regulatory capital measures even further. So by design, the Basel II framework allows for flexibility and leaves open the possibility to include risk-management improvements not yet discovered. Analysis of recent Basel II data You are most likely aware that DATE the U.S. banking agencies conducted additional analysis of the initial results from DATE. The agencies were concerned that the results from DATE, conducted DATE, showed a wider dispersion and a larger overall drop in regulatory capital requirements for the DATE population of banks than the agencies had initially expected. The interagency analysis relating to DATE is essentially complete. From it we learned that the drop in DATE required minimum risk-based capital was largely due to the favorable point in the business cycle when the data were collected; while the previous QIS3 exercise was conducted with data from DATE, a higher credit loss year, DATE reflected the more benign credit conditions present in DATE. We learned that the dispersion among institutions was largely due to the varying risk parameters and methodologies they used, permissible in the DATE exercise, and also due to portfolio differences. That is, banks have different approaches to risk-management processes, and their models and databases reflect those differences--a point I will return to in just a moment. Importantly, we also learned that some of the data submitted by individual institutions was not complete; in some cases banks did not have estimates of loss in stress periods or used ad hoc estimates, which might have caused minimum regulatory capital to be underestimated. Generally, we realized that all institutions have additional work to do, but the findings did not point to insurmountable problems. Rather, they pointed to areas for future supervisory focus. In that way, the DATE analysis was critical in enabling us to move forward. In general, we were pleased to see that DATE showed that progress is being made toward developing more risk-sensitive capital measures. In fact, it was quite interesting to see the range of practice employed by institutions in developing their DATE estimates. As noted, a fair portion of the dispersion among institutions stemmed from their assignment of risk parameters, with differences in portfolio composition playing some role. The institutions participating in DATE use a variety of credit-rating systems. Rating philosophy is an area in which rating systems can differ, with some focused more on \"through the cycle\" ratings, and others on \"point in time\" ratings. Choices made in rating philosophy can have an impact on how assessments of risk translate into required capital. Additionally, it is quite interesting to see institutions continually working to upgrade their rating systems and incorporate innovations where possible; for example, many systems have recently been enhanced for greater granularity. So although work remains, we believe real strides are being made. In analyzing institutions' estimates of default probabilities, we saw that some firms used internal data, others external data, and some a combination of data sources. We also saw that differences in the use of reference data could affect capital outcomes. Similar results were seen with estimates of loss given default, as firms again used both internal and external data. Furthermore, we saw significant differences across banks in the discounting of recoveries, assumptions for workout costs, methods for incorporating downturn conditions (or lack thereof), and the treatment of collateral. These differences appear to have had significant effects on banks' loss given default estimates and to have contributed to the dispersion in required capital levels across firms. So what does it mean that institutions estimated different parameters for similar exposures? It could mean that not all practices are entirely robust or producing accurate results--understandable given that DATE was a done on a \"best efforts\" basis without close supervisory oversight, that the U.S. agencies need to issue their proposals, and that banks are still in the process of implementation. Differences in parameter estimates could also mean that institutions have varying interpretations of risks or methods to estimate those risks--all of which could be perfectly acceptable. In fact, DATE we see different interpretations and assessment of risks in financial markets as counterparties assume different probabilities of default, estimates of loss, or forecasts of prices. As you know, U.S. supervisors are still developing their Basel II proposals and associated supervisory guidance, so there are not yet any established standards for Basel II. In some cases, we were able to identify practices used for DATE that appeared to be clearly inconsistent with what is envisioned in the framework. In other cases, it was not easy to determine whether the practices used in DATE would be within the expected range of acceptable practice for U.S. Basel II standards. Clearly, one of the real challenges we will face as supervisors is to how to define the range of expected practice for Basel II standards, how to communicate that range to institutions, and how to deal with practices that are on the margin. Uncertainty about the expectations placed on institutions does not benefit supervisors or bankers. One of the key ways to reduce that uncertainty would be to continue our communication with the industry broadly, and with institutions individually, during the entire implementation process. Certainly, as we move closer to implementation, supervisory oversight of the Basel II implementation methodologies by our examination teams will increase. Indeed, during the qualification process, we expect to have several additional opportunities to evaluate institutions' risk-management processes, models, and estimates--and provide feedback to the institutions on their progress. So DATE, an assessment conducted at one point in time, should not be considered a complete forecast of institutions' future Basel II capabilities or the framework's ultimate effects. But DATE did give a very useful insight into the linkage between capital and risks, and how institutions are attempting to quantify that linkage. Indeed, it was one of the best glimpses we had to date. As we move forward with Basel II implementation, we expect to gather even more useful supervisory information about banks' progress in meeting Basel II standards, the potential impact of the framework, and, perhaps most importantly, banks' ability to measure and manage the risks to which they are exposed. As supervisors, we will highly value this opportunity to enhance our understanding of banking organizations, which we believe will promote safety and soundness in the banking system. Identifying and addressing home-host issues Given this extensive international audience, it might be helpful for me to offer the Federal Reserve's perspective of the so-called \"home-host\" aspects of Basel II implementation--a perspective that I believe is shared by my U.S. supervisory colleagues. First, we recognize that some may have concerns about the recent announcement by the U.S. agencies to implement Basel II with a DATE delay and with DATE of transitional floors. Understandably, internationally active organizations may worry that cross-border implementation will be complicated by the timing differences between the United States and other Basel member countries. While not downplaying potential challenges, the U.S. agencies, in deciding to adjust implementation plans, thought it was important to ensure that implementation in the United States be conducted in a prudential manner and without generating competitive inequalities in our banking markets. As we did before our DATE announcement of altered U.S. implementation plans, the U.S. banking agencies continue to work with institutions and foreign supervisors to minimize the difficulties in cross-border implementation. Our support includes extensive discussion with other countries in the Basel Accord Implementation Group, specifically formed to help address home-host implementation issues. We also have held numerous informal, bilateral discussions with institutions and foreign supervisors, and those will of course continue as implementation moves ahead. One should also remember all Basel-member countries have their own rollout timelines and national discretion issues, not just the United States--which is entirely appropriate. To assist institutions in resolving their crossborder challenges, we are eager to hear specifics from institutions so that we can develop targeted solutions. In addition, Basel-member countries continue to work on guidelines for institutions and supervisors, such as the recently issued consultative paper on home-host information sharing for Basel II. The paper is an attempt to set forth a practical way for home and host supervisors to ensure that they have sufficient information to assess Basel II compliance without being overly burdensome. It contains principles and guidelines, not prescriptive rules, because we do not see a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to information sharing. Instead, arrangements should be tailored to the unique circumstances of both the bank and the supervisors involved, and should be worked out by the supervisors involved on a case-by-case basis in a pragmatic manner. Additionally, the home-host paper emphasizes that information sharing within the bank itself is equally important. Local management of a banking subsidiary should understand and manage its risk profile, and should have access to information about Basel II implementation in its jurisdiction. Taking a step back, I think it is also helpful to remember that a number of the home-host issues pertaining to Basel II are actually variations of long-standing challenges faced by bankers and supervisors in the context of cross-border banking. That is, many of the issues under discussion are not necessarily new, but just made more complicated by the framework. The good news is that supervisors are already building upon their existing relationships to accommodate differences in national jurisdictions and minimize the burdens placed on banks. We believe the Federal Reserve has a long history of working constructively with other national supervisors in this manner. While such cooperation and information sharing can go a long way toward reducing the burden placed on bankers, at DATE we must realize that national jurisdictions still matter. We can work to harmonize differences, but it is probably not practical to try to eliminate them entirely. Conclusion Basel II provides a means for regulators to rely more on banks' internal estimates of risks--but only if those estimates meet certain supervisory standards. Our expectation is that Basel II will also promote further enhancements to risk management. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve considers Basel II to be a worthwhile undertaking and we look forward to its implementation. The recent DATE exercise in the United States provided valuable information about the Basel II framework and banks' progress in estimating more risk-sensitive regulatory capital measures. It also offered some sense of how institutions are implementing advanced risk- management practices more generally. As the Basel II implementation process moves along, we look forward to gathering additional information and further enhancing our understanding of institutions' practices.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Observations on measuring and managing operational risk under Basel II Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve System's Conference on Implementing an Advanced Measurement Approach for Operational Risk, Boston, DATE.    Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve's conference - \"Implementing an Advanced Measurement Approach for Operational Risk.\" It gives me great pleasure to open this conference. I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Board staff for organizing this important event and all the speakers for the time and effort they have devoted to making this conference worthwhile. Indeed, judging from the impressive lineup of speakers, this conference should be a highly useful forum for an exchange of ideas. I also want to extend a special welcome to the international supervisors and bankers who are in attendance. I know that some of you have spent the earlier part of DATE sharing your views about and experiences with the implementation of the Basel II operational risk framework and working to achieve an appropriate level of consistency in implementation across countries. Our hope is that this conference will broaden and deepen the understanding within the banking and regulatory community of operational-risk measurement techniques, both quantitative and qualitative, particularly as they relate to the development of the advanced measurement approaches, or AMAs. I think you have an interesting DATE ahead of you, with an opportunity to hear the current state of implementation from banks and regulators. Specifically, TIME you will hear supervisors describe the range of practices they observed during the \"interagency AMA benchmarking exercise\" conducted DATE at institutions that will likely be required to adopt Basel II. They will also summarize the results of the operational-risk-loss data-collection exercise and Fourth Quantitative Impact Study - known as QIS4. TIME you will hear from academics and practitioners who are experts in measuring operational risk, and DATE you will hear from financial institutions who will share their practical experiences in designing and implementing operational-risk measurement systems and then from regulators on the outstanding policy issues. DATE, I would like to address some of the practical aspects of implementing Basel II in the United States, including some observations on progress being made in the management and measurement of operational risk as well as some observations on the challenges associated with implementing an AMA. Implementation of Basel II in the United States The agencies' reaction to the results of QIS4 shows how seriously we are taking Basel II implementation. As you probably know, the agencies issued a statement on DATE indicating that results from QIS4 were more widely dispersed and showed a larger overall drop in capital than we had expected. This was the impetus for deciding to delay issuance of our next round of proposals for Basel II. These unexpected results show the continued benefit of conducting periodic quantitative impact studies. They serve as a milestone to help us calibrate the progress of the framework and the bankers as we move to Basel II. We now must determine the reasons for the unexpected results from QIS4. Do they reflect actual differences in risk among respondents when prior supervisory information suggested more similarity in credit quality? None of the participating banks has completed their databases and models for all of their risk areas. In some cases, this created results that would not be reliable for implementing Basel II. For example, for some portfolios, expected losses reflected only the DATE or two of results. Thus, the strong credit performance of recent experience was not balanced by higher losses at other points of the credit cycle. Were there limits of the QIS4 exercise itself? Is there a possible need for adjustments to the Basel framework? Analyzing the data used in QIS4 is vitally important, because ultimately the success of Basel II will depend on the quantity and quality of data that banks have to use as inputs to the framework. U.S. regulators expect to provide additional information on the lessons we learn from the QIS4 review in the near future. The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for Basel II will incorporate what we learn from this exercise. But we really are caught in a process dilemma. Bankers cannot complete their models and collect the necessary data until they know what the specific requirements will be. Regulators, on the other hand, will have to develop these requirements before seeing the actual results of these models and robust databases. Given what a vast undertaking Basel II is, this seems entirely appropriate and beneficial. In addition to what we learn from the work on QIS4 results, we will also assess the trading and banking book comments of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. We will incorporate the latest proposal into the notice of proposed rulemaking and hope to complete our efforts in a timely manner. In addition, under our current plans, we also will be delaying issuance of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to revise current capital rules for non-Basel II banks. U.S. banking regulators have longed recognized that the existing capital rules need to be updated. These modifications are needed to reflect changing products and risk exposures and also to address potential competitive impacts from Basel II. We plan to issue these proposals for public comment concurrently with, or soon after, the NPR on Basel II to allow the banking community to comment on a combined package. I will now turn to some observations about operational risk. Observations related to implementing an AMA As you may know, I have spent much of my career in the field of risk management, and of course the Federal Reserve has a keen interest in this topic. For those of us who have spent DATE in the business, it is easy to see the recent progress in the quantitative aspects of risk management brought about by improved databases and technological advances. Indeed, the development of techniques for the measurement and management of operational risk is very dynamic, with much progress being made relatively recently. Evidence of this dynamic development process can be seen in the results of an interagency AMA benchmarking exercise conducted DATE, as well as the results of the operational-risk-loss data-collection exercise and QIS4. In fact, one very encouraging sign of progress in measuring operational risk is the broad participation we saw in the loss data-collection exercise and on the operational-risk portions of QIS4. As you will hear in more detail later TIME, twenty-seven institutions participated in these exercises; and it appears that, based on our preliminary analysis of the submissions, significant progress has been made in the collection of operational-risk data and the quantification of operational risk. A review of the loss data submitted by you and your colleagues shows a substantial increase in the number of institutions collecting operational-risk data over DATE. In addition, the QIS4 responses suggest that although significant quantification challenges remain, many institutions are developing sophisticated approaches for measuring their operational-risk exposure. It has often been argued that measuring operational risk is much more difficult than measuring market or credit risk. The lack of a consistent definition of operational risk (until recently); the central role of the internal control environment; the relatively short time span of historical loss data; and the important role of infrequent, but very large, loss events are just some of the challenges that operational-risk measurement systems have had to confront. Coming up with credible ways of capturing the tail of the loss distribution and, just as important, of verifying that it has been captured in a reasonably accurate and consistent way, have presented interesting challenges to those developing operational-risk measurement frameworks. But, in a very real sense, these challenges have become the true strengths of the operational-risk measurement discipline. As will be very evident from the presentations over the next DATE, tremendous creativity and insight have been brought to bear on the issue of operational-risk measurement. To address the difficulties presented by the very nature of the risk, the designers of operational-risk measurement frameworks have had to be more innovative, take bigger steps into new territory, and be more willing to step away from traditional - and comfortably familiar - techniques than their counterparts in the market- and credit-risk arenas. Designers of operational-risk measurement systems have had to do some really fundamental thinking about the goals of risk measurement and about the tools used to achieve those goals. As a result, we have seen innovation in the use of \"soft\" data derived from scenario analysis, risk self-assessments, and the judgment of senior business managers. We have seen creativity in the melding of internal and external loss data to guide thinking about internal loss exposures. Perhaps most significantly, we have seen some truly innovative thinking about ways to integrate operational-risk measurement into the broader framework of operational-risk management. I commend you on all that you have accomplished to date, but substantial work remains to be accomplished before Basel II can \"go live.\" I strongly encourage both bankers and supervisors to continue their efforts to support the evolution of operational-risk measurement and management practices. One of the major challenges bankers face in implementing an AMA is creating a credible database of internal loss-event data on which to base the AMA capital charge. Another, and no less important, challenge is ensuring that operational-risk measurement and management systems are integrated into the day-to-day decisionmaking processes of your institution. The focus on enhanced risk management in Basel II means that banks should not view Basel II preparations with a checklist mentality. Rather, they should be moving ahead on many fronts, looking at how to make the fundamental changes needed for better risk identification, measurement, management, and control. By doing so, banks can position themselves to succeed in implementing an operational risk-management and -measurement system on a timely basis. We do, however, recognize that a certain time constraint exists for institutions wishing to implement the new framework. On the one hand, banks are encouraged to start preparations as soon as possible; on the other hand, we leave open the possibility that elements of the framework are subject to change. This is not a trivial matter. As a former banker, I sympathize with the challenges you face in deciding on investments and upgrades to your systems and personnel. When it comes to Basel II, we recognize that certain details relating to systems and processes will depend on what the final U.S. rule and guidance contain. Accordingly, your primary supervisor is available to discuss your implementation efforts and we want to hear specifics about which elements of the proposal, from your perspective, will demand the greatest investments or appear to generate the greatest uncertainty. Using that information, the agencies can then understand where to target resources to assist banks during the transition to Basel II. We certainly hope that many upgrades made for Basel II are those that would have been made anyway to strengthen enterprise-risk management. An additional challenge that you face in implementing an AMA is that operational risk has only relatively recently risen to management and regulatory attention - not because it was previously unimportant, but because it has been so difficult to measure. As QIS4 has demonstrated, we are still in the early stages of measuring this risk, and the challenges in gathering the relevant data and developing the models are still great. The main reason for the lack of data, as I am sure many of you know firsthand, is simply the fact that most banks have only recently started systematically collecting operational-loss data. While the importance of models and loss data in quantifying operational risk may be quite apparent - at least to practitioners of the art - the importance of the qualitative aspects may be less so. In practice, though, these qualitative aspects are no less important to the successful operation of a business - as events continue to demonstrate. Some qualitative factors, such as experience and judgment, affect what one does with model results. It is important that we not let models make the decisions, that we keep in mind that they are just tools, because in many cases it is management experience - aided by models to be sure - that helps to limit losses. Some qualitative factors affect what the models and risk measures say, including the parameters and modeling assumptions used and the choices that relate to the characteristics of the underlying data and the historical period from which the data are drawn. I think you will hear a common theme DATE and DATE: Value is added to the firm when operational-risk measurement is integrated with the business-unit management processes. In other words, the business-line staff should be in the process of developing the firm-wide operational-risk measurement framework. While firms generally are developing corporate-level operational-risk management functions and firm-wide policies and procedures to bring greater consistency to how operational risk is measured throughout the institution, business-line staff can add significant value to this effort through their understanding of inherent risks and controls in their areas. And finally, the more business- line staff is involved in the development of the measurement framework and the more transparent the framework is, the more credible will be the process of allocating the total capital number back to the business lines - an effort in which many of the banks represented here DATE are now engaged. To be meaningful, the quantification of operational risk must be forward-looking. This means that a mechanical focus on historic loss data series will not work. We must recognize the roles of qualitative factors and a well-reasoned assessment of what we will call stress events or scenario analysis. In this regard, the burden is on management to exercise judgment. Clearly, this judgment must include consideration not only of a soundness standard but also of contingencies and actions taken to reduce the risks posed by those contingencies. A self-assessment of the internal control structure and overall risk-management process is crucial. Clearly, this is not a simple process if the results are to be relevant to the specific risk profile of the firm. But based on the progress we have seen to date in this area, I think you are up to the challenge and I encourage you to keep moving forward. Before I wrap up, I would like to say a few words directly to the potential \"opt-in\" institutions. An institution that does not meet the mandatory criteria in the framework will be under no obligation to adopt Basel II. Some potential opt-in institutions have complex and varied operations and are developing enhanced enterprise-wide risk-management processes and systems to strengthen their internal control environments. These institutions understand that complex operations receive a more structured and well-defined risk-management framework to monitor the effectiveness of internal control processes and risk exposures. For these organizations, the incremental cost to opt into Basel II advanced approaches will be a relatively moderate incremental cost. For other financial institutions, with a simpler organizational structure and less-complex processes and services, a less-sophisticated enterprise-wide risk-management and -measurement is entirely appropriate. For these organizations, the incremental cost to develop advanced Basel II systems can be substantial. These organizations may appropriately choose not to adopt Basel II, especially at the earliest possible date. If they choose to opt in, they may want to implement Basel II later when they can take advantage of third-party models and databases to assist in the development of their systems at much lower costs. Also, I would like to quell any concerns that potential opt-in institutions may have about being viewed as having inferior risk-management systems if they decide not to adopt Basel II. It is important for you to know that, as supervisors, we will not look upon institutions that decide not to adopt Basel II as having deficient risk-management systems simply because they choose to stay under the Basel I capital framework. As supervisors, our focus will continue to be on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate for operations of each institution and that those risk systems operate effectively. Thus, we expect that non-Basel II banks will continue to have CAMELS NUM and NUM ratings as they operate in a safe and sound manner. As Basel II implementation continues, customers, credit rating agencies, and analysts should also understand these fundamental concepts of effective risk management and internal controls. Conclusion In my remarks DATE, I have encouraged you to continue your efforts to support the evolution of operational-risk measurement and management practices. I want to end by reminding all of you not to become so caught up in the latest technical developments that you lose sight of the qualitative aspects of your responsibilities. Models alone do not guarantee an effective risk-management process. You should encourage continuous improvement in all aspects, including data integrity and internal controls, to name just a few. For the risk managers at this conference, I hope the message you have heard is that you should be actively engaged with managers throughout the organization, talking about the merits of a consistent, sound enterprise-wide risk-management culture. In doing so, you can help managers see that the risk-management process will allow them to better understand the inherent risks of their activities so that they in turn can more effectively mitigate these risks and achieve their profit goals in a safe and sound manner. The agencies will continue to provide as much information as possible to help potential opt-in institutions make their decisions. Our supervisory teams continue to stand ready to discuss Basel II issues with all institutions and answer any questions that arise.",

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Risk management and Basel II Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston AMA Conference, Boston, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    I am delighted to be here DATE at this impressive conference. I thank my hosts, President Rosengren and his staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, for the invitation. I also thank President Rosengren for providing such interesting and informative introductory remarks. Over DATE, you will be having a number of discussions on specific aspects of operational risk and the advanced measurements approaches (AMA) for calculating riskbased capital requirements under Basel II. Therefore, I can probably best contribute to this conference by offering a broader perspective about risk management and Basel II, using examples from the field of operational risk management. I will discuss the implementation of Basel II, including enhancements to the framework being undertaken by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in light of recent market events, as well as a proposal to implement in the United States a less complex version of the Basel II framework, known as the standardized approach. Background I believe focusing on risk management DATE is certainly topical, given some of the risk management challenges that financial institutions have faced over DATE. Recent market events have shown that a number of institutions have not maintained satisfactory risk management practices; however, we also can point to many examples of sound risk management practices during the recent disruptions.NUM Individual institutions are responsible for maintaining sound risk management practices. But supervisors, of course, also have a role to play both in promoting effective risk management and offering incentives for bankers to make improvements to their practices. There are a number of methods supervisors use to that end - some informal, some formal - including speeches, one-on-one discussions, supervisory guidance, onsite examinations, formal supervisory actions, and regulations. One substantial initiative that seeks to improve risk management practices at banking organizations is Basel II. Importance of Basel II As you all know, banking activities must be supported by both sound risk management and strong capital levels. For example, even where robust internal controls are in place, the potential for losses from fraud can never be fully eliminated, meaning that institutions need to hold sufficient capital to offset unexpected losses. Determining the right level of capital to hold for fraud and other elements of operational risk is not necessarily easy, as many of you here can attest. But the AMA is designed to make that determination more risk sensitive and more accurate. In this manner, Basel II represents a major step forward in banking regulation. While the existing Basel I capital regime was a significant advance when introduced in DATE, it has become outdated for large, internationally active banking organizations. Retaining Basel I for these institutions would have widened the gap between their regulatory capital requirements and their actual risk profiles. That is one reason why the Federal Reserve supports Basel II so strongly. With regard to credit risk, the advanced approaches of Basel II improve regulatory capital measures by requiring banks to distinguish among the credit quality of individual borrowers. Generally speaking, banks holding riskier credit exposures are required to hold more capital. Similarly, the AMA framework requires a more systematic approach for assessing the operational risk to which a bank is exposed and ties an explicit regulatory risk-based capital requirement to these exposures. Under Basel I, this charge was indirect and embedded in credit and market risk measures. In contrast, under the AMA, banks with higher levels of operational risk - such as those more heavily involved than others in activities that have elevated loss potential from fraud, business disruption, or systems failure - generally should have higher capital requirements. By establishing a much more refined approach that requires banks to hold capital commensurate with the actual risks of their exposures and activities, Basel II should lead institutions to make better decisions about assuming, retaining, and mitigating risks. Not only does Basel II establish more risk-sensitive and meaningful regulatory capital requirements, it also encourages ongoing improvements in banks' risk management practices. The U.S. final rule for Basel II includes extensive system and process requirements and U.S. supervisors have high standards for banks seeking to qualify. One reason for such high standards is that the framework will only function as intended if Basel II banks have solid risk management infrastructures and robust quantification methods on which to base capital requirements. Another reason for such high standards is that the risk management improvements in Basel II offer broader safety and soundness benefits, beyond those associated with capital requirements. Risk management and the AMA There are strong linkages between the AMA and supervisory expectations for sound management of operational risk. The AMA builds upon the longtime best practices of banks to develop techniques for identifying, measuring, and attributing capital for operational risk. I commend those of you here DATE who have made strides in improving operational risk management, and heartily encourage you to maintain your efforts. Supervisors have been working actively with bankers to improve operational risk management and help bankers move toward qualification under AMA. A good example is the research and analysis conducted by my colleagues here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston: their useful papers have covered such topics as estimating operational risk loss distributions, evaluating various measurement techniques, and analyzing the reputational impact of operational risk losses. Supervisors have also conducted a series of loss-data collection exercises in which many of you have participated. More generally, I think supervisory attention on operational risk management has provided support to risk managers striving to improve practices within their organizations. The AMA has specific qualification requirements that are intended to bring about risk management improvements. For example, institutions are required to categorize operational risk losses by event type, which promotes identification of the underlying risk drivers of each category. The AMA also requires consistent comprehensive operational risk capture, which promotes an enterprise-wide assessment across all business units within an entire organization. Moreover, qualifying for the AMA requires strong senior management and board oversight of the entire process. In designing AMA requirements, supervisors decided against creating a mandated, standard treatment and instead allowed for considerable flexibility. Allowing more flexibility lets banks create an AMA reflective of their organization, and it promotes innovation in AMA approaches. But that flexibility makes banks more responsible for creating a solid and robust process rather than simply providing inputs to a supervisory-determined formula. Operational risk management is a relatively new field, and a number of challenges remain, such as collecting sufficient and relevant data and developing appropriate modeling techniques to capture low probability events of high severity. Naturally, validating the techniques used in the AMA is also very important, as with any quantitative models. Pillar NUM and Pillar NUM While Pillar NUM minimum capital requirements are very important, people sometimes forget that Basel II has three pillars of equal significance. Under Pillar NUM, banks are required to have an internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), subject to rigorous supervisory review. The bank's ICAAP should ensure that the bank is holding enough overall capital to support its entire risk profile, and it should provide a cushion against the potential impact of periods of financial or economic stress. In its ICAAP, for example, an institution may choose a solvency standard for overall capital adequacy that is higher than the NUM percent implied by the AMA - for example, a solvency standard of NUM or NUM associated with a certain credit rating. As most of you know, estimating capital needs in the tail of a loss distribution becomes more and more difficult the farther out one goes, so simply \"scaling\" the AMA measure will likely not suffice for truly assessing capital adequacy against a higher solvency standard. More broadly, one of the supervisory expectations surrounding the ICAAP is that institutions should understand the limitations of models and conduct stress testing and scenario analysis to provide greater information about potential losses and capital needs. Even good models have their limits - such as incomplete data or assumptions that have not been tested across business cycles - and need to be supported by more qualitative measures and sound judgment. Put another way, Pillar NUM is not just about using \"one number,\" but requires institutions to develop a robust process to evaluate the full range of potentially adverse outcomes that could affect capital adequacy. This process certainly includes considering the potential for operational risk losses becoming correlated with losses in other risk areas. Recent events provide ample evidence that underestimating the potential for concurrent losses in multiple risk areas can put pressure on capital levels. Pillar NUM plays an important role in providing greater information on banks' risk profiles and their ability to manage them. In addition to disclosing their capital requirements for operational risk under the AMA, banks will have to provide a description of their AMA process, including their measurement approaches and relevant internal and external factors considered. They will also have to provide information about the use of insurance to mitigate operational risk. As a strong believer in market discipline and the importance of information in market transactions, I believe Pillar NUM will improve bank disclosures about risk profiles and enhance discussions between bankers and market participants about risk-management practices. Next steps with Basel II implementation In the United States, Basel II has been an official regulation for DATE. But the full implementation process will take time. While I believe that expeditious application of Basel II will have significant benefits, it is of the utmost importance that the implementation be undertaken thoughtfully and deliberately. As you know, following a successful DATE parallel run, a banking organization would have to progress through three transitional periods - each lasting DATE being able to fully implement Basel II. A banking organization would need approval from its primary federal supervisor to move into each of the three transition periods. Of course, we recognize the substantial work that bankers have undertaken over DATE to prepare themselves for Basel II, and we think that preparation will pay off. Thus, before setting a parallel run target start date, we strongly recommend that banks conduct a sober and frank self-appraisal of their current state as well as their ability to meet requirements of the final rule. Systems development can take time, for example, and it is important to make sure that these systems function appropriately. As stated in the final rule, and as the U.S. agencies articulated DATE, a key instrument in the qualification process is a bank's implementation plan. This written implementation plan, approved by a bank's full board of directors, is a detailed and tangible representation of how the bank complies, or intends to comply, with the rule's qualification requirements. Our hope is to provide a bit more information in DATE or so about our expectations for these plans, so I will only provide high-level comments here. One important part of a credible implementation plan is a thorough assessment of how the bank intends to address the gaps it has identified between its existing practices and the qualification requirements set forth in the rule for the advanced approaches that cover all consolidated subsidiaries. The implementation plan also must include objective, measurable milestones - including delivery dates - and a target date when the bank expects its advanced approaches to be fully operational. The bank must establish and maintain a sound, comprehensive planning and governance process to oversee implementation efforts, and it must demonstrate to the full satisfaction of its supervisor that it meets the qualification requirements. Because the implementation plan (including the gap analysis) is the only requirement to enter parallel run, the agencies have high expectations for its overall quality and the reasonableness of the approach taken by the banks in assessing their current state. The large, internationally active banks subject to the final rule on a mandatory basis - the core banks - have until DATE to adopt an implementation plan and have it approved by their board of directors. This deadline for submission of plans by core banks is intended to ensure that the board of directors will provide the necessary resources and oversight and prevent delays in implementation efforts. Of course, banks may always submit their plans earlier. Once they have adopted an implementation plan, banks have ample time to fully meet the qualification requirements, since the final rule allows a bank DATE before it would have to exit parallel run and enter the first transition period. As with all things, however, waiting until the last possible moment leaves little margin for error. Again, as supervisors, we understand that banks face challenges in implementing Basel II, and we stand ready to assist bankers as they work to meet the high standards we expect. For one, we have already engaged in a number of discussions with bankers to address their questions on certain aspects of the final rule. In that effort, supervisory staffs of all the U.S. agencies are working together to ensure that we give consistent messages to bankers, and we intend to maintain such cooperation among the agencies throughout the implementation process. We have also been preparing our examiners to assess banks' practices during the qualification process. In this manner, we have been working to ensure that qualification is done thoroughly, fairly, and consistently. Enhancements to the Basel II framework One of the substantial benefits of the Basel II framework is its overall flexibility and adaptability to new practices, instruments, and circumstances. That is, Basel II provides a robust structure within which to integrate new information and enhanced risk management practices as needed. As such, the Basel II framework is well suited to address some of the current challenges seen with the current Basel I framework. For example, the new framework's credit risk capital charges for mortgages vary with the underlying riskiness of the exposures unlike Basel I. Basel II also takes into account off-balance sheet exposures much better than the Basel I framework. Just as lessons learned from recent events can help bankers improve risk management practices, they can also help supervisors further increase the effectiveness of the Basel II framework. Indeed, members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recently announced plans to strengthen the resiliency of the framework based on the lessons we have learned over DATE. The Basel Committee's plans to enhance aspects of Basel II are entirely consistent with what we have done in the past with regulatory capital rules upon receiving new information and represent good supervisory practice. These proposals to enhance the resiliency of the Basel II framework are fully consistent with one of its key objectives - improving risk management - and should in no way interfere with institutions' efforts to meet the process and system requirements in the U.S. final rule. The Basel Committee's enhancements, which it outlined in an DATE press release,NUM are intended to improve Basel II's ability to make the banking system more resilient to financial shocks. For one, the Committee will revise the framework to establish higher capital requirements for certain complex structured credit products, such as so-called \"resecuritizations\" or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) of asset-backed securities, which have been the source of many losses during the recent market disturbances. There are also plans to strengthen the capital treatment of liquidity facilities extended by banks to support off-balance sheet vehicles such as asset-backed commercial paper conduits. Furthermore, the Committee will strengthen the capital requirements in the trading book, given the large growth in trading-book assets and the wide range of instruments held there, some of them quite complex and less liquid. The current value-at-risk based treatment for assessing capital for trading book risk is limited in its ability to capture extraordinary events that can affect many complex and less liquid exposures. The Committee is working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on an interim treatment for certain instruments held in the trading book, such as complex securitizations, and will conduct further analysis to determine a suitable longer-term approach. The Committee plans to issue Pillar NUM guidance in a number of areas to help strengthen banks' practices and help them better prepare for financial shocks that could affect capital adequacy. Areas under consideration include proper asssessment of the risks from offbalance sheet exposures and securitizations, as well as the need to address reputational risk and apply proper stress testing. These efforts relating to Pillar NUM are certainly in line with my earlier comments that bankers must understand the limitations of their more formal risk models, and think creatively to ensure that they have captured all risks and addressed them appropriately. Going forward, the Committee will monitor Basel II minimum requirements and capital buffers to evaluate their appropriateness. It will also assess banks' internal capital management processes and associated risk management practices. This oversight will be particularly important given some of the breakdowns in risk management at institutions over DATE and the associated pressures on capital ratios. The Committee is also working to promote better disclosures by banking organizations under Pillar NUM. Standardized approach in the United States As a final point, I would like to mention that U.S. agencies plan, fairly soon, to publish for public comment a set of proposed rules that would provide an optional capital framework - known as the standardized approach - for those banks not subject to the advanced approaches of Basel II. The proposed standardized approach would help increase risk sensitivity and foster competitive equity. Since we have not yet formally issued the proposed rules for public comment, I will provide just a brief overview on aspects of the proposal that the agencies have already discussed publicly. The proposed U.S. standardized approach will be based on the approach of the same name in the international Basel II framework, modified in some areas to suit the U.S. banking system. The standardized approach would enhance risk sensitivity by increasing the number of risk-weight categories to which a bank would assign credit exposures. It also would increase capital requirements for certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as liquidity commitments, and allow for broader recognition of credit risk mitigants, such as collateral and guarantees. In addition, the approach will include a specific capital requirement for operational risk. Banks not required to adopt the Basel II advanced approaches are facing a choice about whether to opt-in to them. Some of these banks may be sophisticated institutions that exhibit sound risk management, but they might not wish to undertake the extensive effort to meet the advanced approaches of Basel II. The agencies recognize that such institutions should be afforded an alternative to more-risk-sensitive capital requirements, one not as complex as the advanced approaches. Therefore, the proposal is being developed as an optional riskbased capital framework for all banking organizations not required to adopt the Basel II advanced approaches. We plan to retain our existing Basel I-based regulatory capital framework for those banks that would prefer to remain under that regime. I encourage all interested parties to review and comment on this proposal once it has been issued. We are keenly aware of the need for capital requirements to make sense from a standpoint that considers safety, soundness, and competitiveness; we recognize that a onesize-fits-all approach is probably not the best for our banking system, in light of our wide range of institutions. We remain sensitive to the principle that if we have multiple regulatory capital frameworks they must work together to support the safety and soundness of our entire banking system without artificially creating competitive inequalities. Conclusion My remarks DATE have focused on the risk management aspects of Basel II, with particular emphasis on operational risk. Events of DATE have shown that institutions should never let their guard down when it comes to risk management. Even though most of the highprofile losses during DATE have - so far - stemmed from market and credit risks, one should not, therefore, assume that less attention should be paid to operational risk management. The Basel II capital framework is a positive step forward through its combination of more risk-sensitive capital requirements with strong incentives for improved risk management. In this manner, we expect Basel II to make the U.S. banking industry more resilient in the face of future financial turbulence and generally more safe and sound.",

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Implementing Basel II in the United States Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Standard & Poor's Bank Conference DATE, New York, NUM November DATE.    Good TIME. I would like to thank Standard and Poor's for the invitation to speak DATE at this impressive conference. I am quite pleased to be able to offer some remarks on Basel II implementation in the United States. I am even more pleased that in DATE's speech I can now talk about U.S. implementation of Basel II in the present tense, since within DATE each of the U.S. banking agencies approved the U.S. final rule for Basel II. While work on Basel II - for both bankers and supervisors - is far from complete, adoption of the Basel II rule is nevertheless a very important accomplishment. I would also like to offer thanks and extend congratulations to all the parties involved in the successful adoption of Basel II. This includes staff at each of the U.S. banking agencies, who worked tirelessly and with incredible determination and patience to see this rulemaking to its completion, as well as the principals at the other agencies, who worked very hard to find common ground and develop a rule that would serve the public interest and satisfy each of our agencies' objectives. Of course, I would also like to thank the many industry participants - some of whom may be here DATE - who spent considerable time and effort providing valuable comments on our proposals over DATE. Your contributions made the final rule a much better product. Developing Basel II was like running a marathon, and even though some of us may have hit the wall and wanted to drop out at mile NUM, we persevered and successfully reached the finish line. I am proud of what we have all accomplished. Completion of the U.S. final rule In the banking industry, most of the innovation and evolution in risk-management practices occur on a continuous basis, generally in small steps. Updates to banking regulations, on the other hand, typically occur in large jumps. As was the case with Basel I DATE, I consider the adoption of Basel II to be a major step forward in banking regulation in the United States. Importantly, we are also working on an additional proposal, known as the standardized approach, to offer non-core banks a set of regulatory capital requirements that have more risk sensitivity than the current Basel I rules, but less complexity than the advanced approaches in the Basel II final rule. One of the main reasons we were able to complete the Basel II final rule successfully, I believe, was our renewed focus on the fundamental rationale for developing Basel II: enhancing the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system by providing more-risksensitive capital requirements for our largest, most complex banks and improving risk management practices at those institutions. Moreover, we endorsed the notion that the U.S. rule would foster international consistency and be less burdensome on banks if it adhered more closely to the international Basel II framework finalized in DATE - and if it also aligned as closely as possible with what banks themselves were doing for risk management. These were principles that I emphasized as I represented the Federal Reserve in interagency discussions, and I believe my counterparts shared these views. Perhaps our ability to refocus stemmed from a fresh set of comments received on our proposals, our renewed commitment to getting things right, and the infusion of some new approaches brought to the table. Regardless, we of course owe a huge debt of gratitude to our predecessors, who broke the hard ground in the long U.S. rulemaking process. Reasons for adopting Basel II I would like to return briefly to our reasons for adopting Basel II, since it is useful to remember why we undertook so much effort to see it through. While the existing Basel I capital regime was a major step forward when introduced in DATE, it has become outdated for large, complex banking organizations. Retaining Basel I for these institutions would have widened the gap between their regulatory capital requirements and their actual risk profiles, generating further incentives for regulatory arbitrage to take advantage of that gap. In contrast to the simple risk-bucketing approach of Basel I, in which exposures to obligors of varying creditworthiness were given the same capital treatment, the new Basel II rules require banks to distinguish among the credit quality of individual borrowers. For example, under Basel I almost all first-lien residential mortgage exposures are subject to the same risk weight regardless of the borrower's creditworthiness, whereas Basel II provides for a more refined differentiation of low- versus high-credit-quality mortgage borrowers. Likewise, Basel I is inadequate for dealing with capital markets transactions such as highly structured assetbacked securities. Basel II, on the other hand, provides a much more refined approach by requiring banks to hold capital commensurate with the actual risks of such transactions. Recent market events highlight why a robust and independent assessment of risk on the part of banks is so important. The enhanced risk-sensitivity of the Basel II advanced approaches creates positive incentives for banks to lend to more-creditworthy counterparties and to lend against good collateral, by requiring banks to hold more capital against higher-risk exposures. The Federal Reserve's role as the nation's central bank reinforces our belief in the importance of maintaining prudent and risk-sensitive capital requirements for financial institutions. Financial stability is enhanced when banks' regulatory capital measures adequately reflect risk, as well as when banks continually improve their risk-management practices. Since the Basel II regime is far superior to the current Basel I regime in aligning regulatory capital requirements with risk and fostering continual improvements in risk management for our largest and most complex banking organizations, I believe it will contribute to a more resilient financial system as a whole. In addition, let me emphasize that the Basel II regulatory capital framework establishes a more coherent relationship between regulatory measures of capital adequacy and the day-DATE risk management conducted by banks. That is, it builds on risk-management tools, such as credit-risk rating systems and economic capital, that are already in use at sophisticated financial institutions. As a result, Basel II will be better able than the current system to adapt over time to innovations in banking and financial markets and will reduce incentives for arbitrage that arise from the gap between what the regulators require and what sound economic risk management requires. Moving ahead with Basel II implementation Next steps for supervisors I used the analogy of running a marathon earlier, describing how the final rule represented a finish line of sorts for the U.S. banking agencies. Alas, I'm afraid that we cannot rest because in fact we have simply passed the baton from the runner in the first stage of the race - rule finalization - to the runner in the next stage - implementation. Successful implementation of Basel II will require additional hard work and determination. As most of you know, the agencies have for some time been preparing for Basel II implementation by working to integrate Basel II into our day-to-day supervisory processes. With completion of the final rule, we must now be ready to pace ourselves through another long, intensive, but ultimately rewarding, effort. The agencies are already working hard to foster consistency across banks and across the agencies. We are building upon the cooperation already established through our work on the final rule and our efforts to prepare supervisory staff for the Basel II qualification process. Our supervisory staffs have been meeting regularly for some time to align qualification approaches, iron out any differences, and ensure that each bank subject to Basel II is treated appropriately and consistently. We also remain attentive to the way in which the framework is implemented in other countries, so that we can minimize the burden placed on banks by having to meet multiple national rules. I hope our decision to align the definition of default for wholesale exposures more closely with the definition used internationally, for example, sends a positive signal about our intentions to increase cross-border consistency and reduce unnecessary burdens that can distract banks from one of the fundamental goals of Basel II - improving risk management. Of course, the agencies need to move ahead with Basel II implementation carefully and with our eyes wide open. The advanced approaches are a significant change from our current, time-tested, risk-based capital rules, and we have therefore embedded the transitional safeguards set forth in the agencies' DATE proposal into the U.S. Basel II rule. These safeguards will help ensure that capital levels remain strong and that we have sufficient opportunity to assess the framework before full implementation. Importantly, we also are retaining the leverage ratio and our existing prompt-corrective-action framework. As noted in the agencies' DATE press release, we are committed to a robust and transparent study of the framework during the transitional phase to assess its overall effectiveness, and we will address any material deficiencies that we identify. This study should include active and meaningful dialogue among the agencies, the industry, market participants, Congress, and other interested parties. This is consistent with my view that whenever regulators undertake a major regulatory change, a careful and thorough empirical review of the effectiveness of the regulation is extremely valuable. Such a review can help assess whether the goals for the rule are being met, whether the benefits of the rule exceed the costs, and how the rule can be made more effective and less burdensome. In addition to this study, during and after the transitional phase we will be relying upon ongoing, detailed analyses to evaluate continuously the results of the new framework in operation. A primary objective of this ongoing review will be to ensure that capital levels remain prudent. For example, we will respond if we see unreasonable declines in capital requirements at individual institutions that do not appear to be supported by either those banks' own internal capital-adequacy assessments or by our supervisory view of those institutions' risks and how well those risks are managed. As has long been the case with our capital rules, we expect that adjustments to the capital framework will be made over time to address industry and market developments, any potential shortcomings in the rule identified in our review and analysis during implementation, and new and improved techniques of risk management. Next steps for bankers Completion of the Basel II rulemaking process means that banks adopting the new rule must also gear up their efforts. Of course we recognize the substantial work that bankers have undertaken over DATE to prepare themselves for Basel II. But, understandably, they have had to wait for completion of the final rule to see how the agencies would articulate certain requirements - some of them quite detailed. Therefore, it would seem that bankers need to read the rule very carefully and take time to understand how their own bank will be able to meet its requirements. As stated in the final rule, and as the U.S. agencies articulated DATE, the key instrument in the qualification process is a bank's implementation plan. This written implementation plan, approved by a bank's board of directors, must describe in detail how the bank complies, or intends to comply, with the rule's qualification requirements. Specifically, the plan must describe how the bank intends to address the gaps it has identified between its existing practices and the qualification requirements set forth in the rule for the advanced approaches, covering all consolidated subsidiaries. The implementation plan also must include objective, measurable milestones - including delivery dates - and a target date when the bank expects its advanced approaches to be fully operational. The bank must establish and maintain a comprehensive and sound planning and governance process to oversee implementation efforts, and must demonstrate to its supervisor that it meets the qualification requirements. Banks subject to the final rule on a mandatory basis, the core banks, have DATE to adopt an implementation plan. Of course, banks may always submit their plans earlier, and I understand that a number of core banks are working toward that goal. This deadline for submission of plans by core banks is intended to prevent delays in starting implementation efforts. However, the final rule provides flexibility and gives banks adopting Basel II ample time to fully meet the qualification requirements once they have adopted an implementation plan. Specifically, a bank's plan may include developmental goals for full implementation for up to DATE from the effective date of the final rule. As supervisors, we will take the qualification requirements seriously, expecting banks to meet both the letter and the spirit of those requirements. Thus, we strongly recommend that banks undertake their own sober and frank appraisal of their ability to meet the final rule. Systems development can take time, for example, and it is important to make sure that these systems function appropriately. While I believe that expeditious adoption of Basel II will have significant benefits, it is of the utmost importance that the implementation not be rushed but be undertaken thoughtfully and deliberately. After a bank has submitted a credible implementation plan to its primary supervisor, it must then begin a parallel run lasting at least four consecutive calendar quarters, during which the bank's supervisor must determine the bank's compliance with the qualification requirements to be satisfactory. During the parallel run, a bank remains subject to the Basel I risk-based capital rules for all applicable regulatory and supervisory purposes, but the bank also must calculate its capital ratios using the advanced approaches and report pertinent information to its supervisor. It is only upon notification from its supervisor that a bank can move into a series of three transitional periods (each lasting DATE), during which the cumulative reductions of the bank's risk-based capital requirements are limited. Supervisory approval is needed to move to a subsequent transitional floor-level and then to move from the transitional floors to stand-alone use of the Basel II rules. Importantly, as bankers move forward with implementation, they should not lose sight of Pillars NUM and NUM, which may ultimately be more important to the success of Basel II than Pillar NUM, which has received the bulk of the attention so far. Under Pillar NUM, banks are required to have an internal process - which will be subject to rigorous supervisory review - for ensuring that they are holding enough overall capital to support their entire risk profile. Thus, Pillar NUM should be a key area of focus for banks implementing Basel II. The preamble to the final rule describes the steps that supervisors will take under Pillar NUM, namely that supervisors will take into account a bank's internal capital-adequacy assessment process - known as its ICAAP - as well as the bank's compliance with the minimum capital requirements set forth in this rule, and all other relevant information. The agencies expect banks to implement and continually update the fundamental elements of a sound ICAAP - identifying and measuring material risks, setting capital-adequacy goals that relate to risk, and ensuring the integrity of internal capital-adequacy assessments. A bank is expected to hold adequate capital against all of its material risks, particularly those risks not covered or not adequately quantified in the risk-based capital requirements - such as liquidity risk or interest-rate risk in the banking book. In general, a bank's ICAAP should reflect an appropriate level of conservatism to account for uncertainty in risk identification, risk mitigation or control, quantitative processes, and any use of modeling. In most cases, this conservatism will result in levels of capital or capital ratios above minimum regulatory requirements to be regarded as adequate. Pillar NUM is a key mechanism for banks to communicate to market participants about their risk profiles, their associated levels of capital, and the manner in which they are meeting the requirements in the final rule. In addition to providing information about its various components of regulatory capital and its minimum capital requirements and ratios, a bank must disclose information about how it measures and manages credit risk, operational risk, equity risk, and interest-rate risk in non-trading activities, as well as the range of risks related to securitizations. For example, a bank has to describe the operation of its credit risk rating system as well as the data used in parameter estimates for credit losses. Some of these disclosure requirements will be new for banks but others are already required by, or are consistent with, existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements, or bank regulatory reporting requirements. As a strong believer in market discipline and the importance of information in market transactions, I believe Pillar NUM will improve bank disclosures about risk profiles and enhance discussions between bankers and market participants about risk-management practices. Of course, while we want to promote consistency, we must also allow bankers some flexibility in meeting the Basel II requirements and permit a reasonable amount of diversity of practices across banking organizations. Such flexibility will allow banks to use and readily improve their existing risk-measurement and risk-management practices. More to the point, as supervisors we should actively encourage such improvements. As we move forward, we encourage banks to raise issues as they try to meet the rule's requirements; in other words, we want banks to maintain an ongoing dialogue about implementation with their supervisors, who stand ready to answer questions and assist banks in interpreting Basel II requirements. Standardized approach proposal for non-core banks Before concluding, I would like to discuss the agencies' additional plans for revising capital rules, specifically plans for those banks not subject to the advanced approaches of Basel II. Some commentators on the earlier Basel II and Basel IA proposals voiced concerns that adoption of a new capital framework for the largest and most complex U.S. banking organizations could disadvantage other U.S. banking organizations, particularly the smaller banks. We understand that banks not required to adopt Basel II are facing a choice about whether to opt-in to the advanced approaches. Some of these banks may be sophisticated institutions that exhibit sound risk management but do not quite meet the criteria to be core banks. The agencies recognize that such institutions should be afforded an alternative for more-risk-sensitive capital requirements, but one that is not as complex as the advanced approaches. In this regard, the agencies have responded by committing to proposing a \"standardized\" approach instead of Basel IA. Specifically, the staffs are currently working on a notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement some of the simpler approaches for both credit risk and operational risk from the Basel II framework - referred to as the standardized approach. The proposal is being developed as an optional risk-based capital framework for all banking organizations that are not required to adopt the advanced approaches. We also expect to retain our existing Basel I-based regulatory capital framework for those smaller banks that would prefer to remain under that regime. The proposal for the standardized approach will take into consideration relevant commentary received in response to the Basel IA and Basel II proposed rules that were published in late DATE and should, in essence, modernize the Basel I-based rules without imposing a substantial implementation burden. Among other things, the proposal is being designed both to provide greater differentiation across corporate exposures based on borrowers' underlying credit quality and to recognize a broader spectrum of credit-risk mitigation techniques. The agencies are also considering how to implement Pillars NUM and NUM of the Basel II framework in the standardized proposal in a manner that is commensurate with banks' complexity and risk profiles. Our goal is to realize the benefits of these two pillars without imposing excessive regulatory burden and without creating competitive advantages or disadvantages for different types of banks. I expect this proposal to be presented to the Board for consideration within DATE, and I encourage all interested parties to review and comment on this proposal once it has been issued. We are keenly aware of the need for capital requirements to make sense from the standpoint of both safety-and-soundness and competitiveness; we recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach is probably not the best for our banking system, in light of our wide range of institutions. We remain sensitive to the principle that if we have multiple regulatory capital frameworks, they must work together to improve the safety and soundness of our entire banking system without artificially creating competitive inequalities. Our goal is to have the standardized approach ready for implementation concurrently with the start of the first Basel II transition phase. Conclusion The U.S. banking agencies have reached an important milestone in adopting the final rule for Basel II. Our focus on the fundamentals of improving risk management consistent with safety and soundness, and on international consistency, has been key to achieving this success. Obviously, however, effective implementation of Basel II is as important as, if not more important than, the rulemaking process. It is imperative that we observe how the new rule works in practice - assessing carefully both its advantages and its limitations. I am confident that both banking organizations and the supervisory community are up to the challenge. It is also important to modernize the existing Basel I-based regulatory capital framework to improve the risk sensitivity of capital requirements at the non-core banks, by offering a standardized option. Finally, we should all bear in mind that implementation of Basel II - and, more significantly, the improvements in risk measurement and management that will be required - will not be a one-time event, but rather an ongoing process. Basel II is designed to accommodate innovation and change as markets and risk-measurement and -management evolve over time. As one marathon is completed, yet another begins.",

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Strategic risk management in an interconnected world Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Risk Management Association Annual Risk Management Conference, Baltimore, Maryland, DATE.    It is not an overstatement to say that we are in the midst of a fundamental transformation in financial services, with market-wide ramifications. At the heart of that transformation lies a much more intense emphasis on funding and liquidity. Additionally, we are all witnessing the extent to which banking and financial markets are interconnected. The current environment certainly presents some fundamental challenges for banking institutions of all types and sizes.NUM Their boards of directors and senior management, who bear the responsibility to set strategy and develop and maintain risk management practices, must not only address current difficulties, but must also establish a framework for the inevitable uncertainty that lies ahead. Notably, the ongoing fundamental transformation in financial services offers great potential opportunities for those institutions able to integrate strategy and risk management successfully, and I will argue that survival will hinge upon such an integration in what I will call a \"strategic risk management framework.\" In the remainder of my remarks, I plan to discuss the necessity for institutions to improve the linkage between overall corporate strategy and risk management, and how they can develop concrete strategic risk management frameworks. I will argue that in the highly interconnected financial world, funding and liquidity need to be at the center of such frameworks. But before doing so, I will briefly review recent events. Recent events in financial markets We are indeed witnessing dramatic shifts in the structure of financial markets. These are quite extraordinary times that have required extraordinary responses from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and other governmental bodies in the United States and around the world. Since DATE, there had been a continuous deterioration of conditions in financial markets, becoming much more acute since DATE. For instance, we have seen significant disruption in several key sectors of our financial system, such as normally creditworthy companies having difficulty issuing commercial paper, dramatic increases in interbank lending rates, and significant concerns about money market funds \"breaking the buck.\" These are sectors usually considered to be relatively low risk and quite liquid, so disruptions here have signaled the extent and depth of this turmoil and the lack of confidence among financial market participants. The Federal Reserve has responded to these developments in two broad ways. First, following classic tenets of central banking, the Federal Reserve has provided large amounts of liquidity to the financial system to cushion the effects of tight conditions in short-term funding markets. Second, to reduce the downside risks to growth emanating from the tightening of credit, the Fed, in a series of moves that began DATE, has significantly lowered its target for the federal funds rate. Indeed, DATE, in an unprecedented joint action with five other major central banks and in response to the adverse implications of the deepening crisis for the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve again eased the stance of monetary policy. We will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to improve market functioning and liquidity, to reduce pressures in key credit and funding markets, and to complement the steps the Treasury and foreign governments will be taking to strengthen the financial system. As a result of these ongoing upheavals, we are witnessing substantial institutional changes, in which some long-standing financial institutions have either failed, sought government assistance, or were forced to merge with other institutions. What were the major U.S. investment banks have essentially disappeared, such as by merging with bank holding companies or becoming bank holding companies themselves. Other major banks and thrifts have been absorbed into other banking organizations. Financial institutions and investors have placed much more emphasis on the banking charter, likely driven by banks' more stable funding and deposit insurance, even before the recently announced government support of the banking system. Over DATE, there has been increasing concern among financial institutions and other counterparties about the health of some financial institutions. Uncertainty about the value of assets and other exposures, as well as uncertainty about the ability of institutions to sustain continued access to funding, has caused financial institutions to operate with great caution and hoard funds. What was once a healthy, active interbank market has become frozen from time to time, as some institutions feel that conditions are so uncertain that they cannot even lend to long-standing clients or counterparties. In quite a dramatic shift from DATE, there is much more scrutiny being placed on capital adequacy, with financial institutions trying to retain as much capital as they can, raise as much as possible, and demonstrate that their capital positions are not impaired. The Capital Purchase Plan by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is focused on improving capital adequacy and, hence, improving confidence in the interbank market. Perhaps one of the most pressing issues, as I mentioned briefly earlier, is the intense emphasis on funding. This dramatic shift in concerns about a financial institution's funding base results in much more focus on the stability of funding sources - one of the reasons that the bank charter has become so attractive. Indeed, we are seeing the emphasis on funding driving many other factors that affect financial institutions, including the viability of various aspects of firms' business models. And problems with liquidity have affected capital levels, which in turn have further exacerbated liquidity concerns. It is indeed quite remarkable how this \"flight to liquidity\" has brought about so many institutional and structural changes, and become essentially the most important factor (at least now) for the viability of a financial institution. Over DATE there have been a number of studies analyzing the causes of the current turmoil, which include shortcomings in the risk management practices of financial institutions.NUM It is absolutely clear that many financial institutions need to undertake a fundamental review of risk management. They now realize that ignoring risk management in any aspect of the banking business usually creates problems later on. Risk management shortcomings need to be addressed not only to improve the health and viability of individual institutions, but also to maintain stability for the financial system as a whole. Framework for strategic risk management At this time, I would like to explain a bit more about what I mean by a \"strategic risk management framework.\" In my view, an effective overall corporate strategy combines a set of activities a firm plans to undertake with an adequate assessment of the risks included in those activities. Unfortunately, many firms have forgotten the second part of that definition. In other words, there can be no real strategic management in financial services without risk management, hence my use of the term \"strategic risk management.\" Risk management needs to be interwoven into all aspects of the firm's business and should be part of the calculus for all decision-making. Strategic decisions about what activities to undertake should not be made unless senior management understands the risks involved; assessing potential returns without fully assessing the corresponding risks to the organization is incomplete, and potentially hazardous, strategic analysis. Ensuring that risk management permeates an entire organization may require some fundamental changes for certain firms. And this lesson applies not just to the prominent organizations mentioned in the headlines of late, but also to smaller firms. Even if smaller firms have been less affected by the recent turmoil (and perhaps have even won back some market share as customers seek more \"traditional\" places to put their money), their managements must understand that the financial landscape has changed and needs to be surveyed anew because events outside of their control in market-wide flight to liquidity, for example, can have direct impacts on them. Of vital importance will be incorporating into strategic risk management the lesson that funding and liquidity will be a major determinant of institutions' success going forward. Building a rigorous strategic risk management framework requires an institution to reexamine both its internal practices and its external environment, and to understand how closely the two are connected. In other words, external factors have an impact on internal practices, but those internal practices, because financial markets are so interconnected, can in turn have an impact on how the institution is viewed externally - and even have an impact on the marketplace more broadly. We have witnessed several such examples of late, in which an institution encountered severe liquidity needs, which then affected funding for other institutions. Institutions need to understand better that a number of factors affecting their business are beyond their control, and that events can have secondary or tertiary \"knock-on\" effects. The real art is to realize that while all institutions may be affected by external factors, each is affected in its own way. Now that I have laid out a general framework for strategic risk management, I would like to offer a few examples of its application. Funding and liquidity As I noted, the clear driver of the fundamental transformation in financial services is the increased importance of funding and liquidity. The ability to secure funding is a fundamental task in banking, and banks have been managing expected liquidity demands since the beginning of banking itself. In times of stress, such as now, having a solid and reliable funding structure becomes much more important, in some cases so much so that it affects most other banking activities. The current turmoil has brought about substantial deleveraging in financial services. Managing this process is an immediate challenge for banking institutions, as they must consider the need to reduce leverage at their own institution as well as understand the consequences of deleveraging at other firms. This is clearly an example of external factors affecting internal practices, and vice versa. From a strategic perspective, bank directors must examine their current and future funding situation in light of recent deleveraging, its nearterm prospects, and the state of overall liquidity in financial markets. Financial institutions rely on external funding in some fashion - either through retail deposits, interbank lending, or debt offerings. Therefore, they must understand that their funding can be subject to the vagaries of the market, such as sudden shortages of market liquidity or rapid swings in investor sentiment. For example, banks may benefit in the near term in attracting deposits and thereby improve their funding positions, but they also may experience more difficulty securing other sources of funds and find that situation persisting for some time. Additionally, counterparty reactions to changes in the business mix or risk profile of an perceived institution (or even the change in its risk profile) could suddenly hamper the ability to find funding. In recognizing the inherent leverage in the business of banking, institutions must examine longer-term implications of funding and liquidity, and begin to build those into the overall strategic plan for their organizations. The market for external funding is an international one, so liquidity troubles in one market can have repercussions in others. Accordingly, banks should be prepared for a range of adverse situations related to funding and market liquidity that can be precipitated by a range of sources. Bank directors and senior management need to anticipate potential difficulties in funding the bank, and demand that solid contingency plans are in place - and are regularly updated - for a variety of funding and liquidity problems. Such plans should include the potential for external factors to generate a funding squeeze for the institution, even if its own positions and risk profile have not materially changed. Preparing for sudden changes in the pricing and availability at any price of funding sources is something that, leading up to the current turmoil, most banks did not fully consider. Instead, their managements focused mostly on building market share, growing revenues, and realizing the short-term profitability of their activities - a telling example of banks not properly including risk management in their overall corporate strategy. As the Senior Supervisors Group Survey of major financial institutions pointed out, there have been numerous examples of failures of strategic risk management and these must be rectified going forward. Finally, strategic risk management for funding and liquidity needs to consider potential liquidity problems on both sides of the balance sheet. We saw such examples recently when there were draws on liquidity commitments to structured investment vehicles and commercial paper conduits, and when banks faced difficulty selling exposures in illiquid markets. When there is a marketwide scramble for liquidity, a bank must be prepared to manage funding challenges and unplanned asset expansions simultaneously. Developing a strong strategic risk management framework that recognizes the vital importance of funding and liquidity to both sides of the balance sheet is one way in which directors and senior management can help ensure that their institutions are ready for such outcomes. They should also ensure that they fully understand that funding and liquidity issues will drive many of the activities in which they will be able to engage, something to which I will now turn. Choice of financial services activities While the financial landscape is by no means settled, certain emerging trends will affect which activities make sense, which exposures should be assumed, and which risks should be undertaken. One immediate trend is that much of the future of business activities of banking organizations will be driven by the increased focus on funding and liquidity. Accordingly, this trend must be integrated into a strategic risk management framework. For instance, there may be less opportunity to pursue activities that were quite prolific under the previous \"originate-to-distribute\" model, such as securitizations, given current disruptions or longer-term uncertainties about the reliability of market liquidity. For similar reasons, other activities, such as investing in collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles - which typically relied on relatively easy maturity transformation - may not be as viable in this new environment. Whether transactions take place on an organized exchange or in the so-called over the counter market is another important aspect of the strategic risk management choices undertaken by an organization. When contracts are traded on an exchange, clearing and settlement, for example, may have less uncertainty associated with them. In addition, an exchange that has a centralized counterparty - perhaps the clearinghouse of the exchange - can reduce uncertainty about counterparty risk and help to avoid market dislocations that can arise from such uncertainty, not only for an individual firm but, potentially, more broadly in that market. Thus, market infrastructure and its impact on how organizations are connected to each other can have a large impact on market confidence in times of stress. Of course, we have seen that uncertainty, fear, and lack of trust among key counterparties can dramatically affect trading in some products across markets in many countries, again an example of the impact of interconnectedness. DATE, institutions are seeking more assurance that their counterparties will not default from DATE to the next. Whether there is a shift to more trading on clearinghouses will be driven by firms' analysis of counterparty credit risk and the extent to which they are comfortable doing business with leveraged counterparties about which they have limited information. Firm managers should take these infrastructure and interconnectedness issues into account in undertaking their own strategic risk management choice about what activities to undertake and the risks posed by each. This is a clear example of how external structures should be taken into account in a firm's strategic planning. In their strategic risk management frameworks, institutions should also understand the broader issue of potential gravitation to a model in which most or all types of financial services are brought together in single institutions. That is, institutions have to prepare for the possibility that they could lose customers and/or be less competitive if they are unable to provide the full set of financial products. Importantly, however, bank directors and senior management, in assembling their strategic risk management framework, should fully understand the complications associated with offering multiple products and engaging in a wide array of activities - such as reputational risk. And they should not automatically assume that engaging in multiple activities in multiple geographic markets will provide so-called \"natural diversification.\" As I just noted, different financial markets and different types of financial services are quite interconnected, and during times of stress all can experience losses concurrently. Of course, there may also be an opportunity for some institutions to benefit from more traditional, \"bread-and-butter banking,\" with exposures and risks tied more closely to bank balance sheets. This potential opportunity for niche banking could have certain benefits, as clients and investors, because of the fear of contagion, seek institutions that are specifically not involved in multiple markets and activities. And local banks can often provide more personalized service and have a better understanding of their clients' needs. In such cases, however, institutions conducting specialized or local business must understand the inherent risks, such as potential risk concentrations. Compensation As many of you know, as an economist I am particularly interested in the impact that compensation has on incentives for bank management.NUM I am pleased that the industry has also begun to address this issue, as reflected in a recent report by the Institute of International Finance.NUM Clearly, the industry needs to better understand the link between compensation and risk management, as in the past those two areas have usually been addressed in isolation. Generally, investors analyze financial institutions on a risk-adjusted basis, interpreting profits based on the amount of risk taken. Management at financial firms should do the same thing with regard to their business units and their employees. A risk-sensitive compensation framework will help provide the right incentives for employees, and establish a better link between the actions of those employees and the firm's overall risk profile. Institutions should be particularly sensitive to employee activities that could either directly or indirectly impair access to funding or disrupt liquidity. Clearly, bank directors have an influential role to play in setting compensation, and they should exercise their authority to establish a more risk-sensitive compensation framework while embedding it in the broader strategic risk management framework of the institution. Directors should understand the consequences of providing too many short-term and onesided incentives. There are many ways that this risk sensitivity could be accomplished, and it is up to the firms themselves to arrive at solutions. One possibility, for example, is to include more types of deferred compensation, since the risks of certain investments or trades may not manifest themselves in the near term. It makes sense to try to match the tenor of compensation with the tenor of the risk profile and, thus explicitly, take into account the longer-run performance of the portfolio or division in which the employee operates. A good risk-sensitive compensation regime, properly embedded in a strong strategic risk management framework, can bring about changes in behavior so that the firm's employees refrain from taking on risk beyond the firm's stated risk appetite. Perhaps most importantly, such a compensation regime must give the appropriate incentives to take risks fully into account during good times, when many often underestimate longer-term risks. Conclusion I have tried to lay out the importance for banking institutions to develop and maintain a strategic risk management framework that fully incorporates all the risks they face - both internal and external - when making choices about what activities and markets in which they will operate. Indeed, having a corporate strategy that does not include risk management at its core is not really a strategy at all. Market infrastructure, which affects not only the ways in which firms are connected to each other but also the types of shocks to confidence that they may encounter, is an important external factor that should be taken into account in strategic risk management. As a concluding point, I will offer a few comments on one additional area to which banking institutions must pay particular attention: the regulatory and supervisory structure in which banks operate. Banking is an industry that is subject both to market competition and considerable regulation. Therefore, banking institutions must not only evaluate potential changes in the competitive financial landscape (as I noted earlier), but must also pay attention to potential changes on the regulatory side. Over DATE, there have been a number of suggestions for possible statutory changes in U.S. financial services regulation, so bank directors must be prepared for whichever outcomes such changes might imply for the regulatory structure in the United States. For example, the Congress may wish to undertake legislative action to effect regulatory changes, or there may be changes to the existing authority and responsibility of certain regulatory bodies. In any event, there will likely be some type of adjustments in regulatory structure simply given the changes in the financial services landscape. Given the fluid situation in which we find ourselves DATE, bank directors and senior management in their strategic planning have to anticipate a range of potential outcomes in the regulatory sphere in both the short and long term. Since banking and financial markets are so interconnected, the fundamental transformation in financial services is affecting all types of financial institutions, even those less directly affected by recent events. Importantly, in developing strategic risk management frameworks, institutions must not only understand the direct consequences to their own firms of such shifts, but must also recognize that consequences to other firms can have effects on the broader market. The heightened importance of funding and liquidity is a clear example of a major change that has far-reaching ramifications and, thus, has to be appropriately addressed in assembling any credible strategic risk management framework in an interconnected world.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: Regulatory perspectives on the changing accounting landscape Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the AICPA National Conference on Banks and Savings Institutions, Washington DC, DATE.    Good morning. I want to thank the AICPA for inviting me to speak at this DATE's Conference on Banks and Savings Institutions. Over the DATEs, this conference has served as an important forum for the exchange of views on regulatory matters, emerging accounting issues, new accounting standards, and new auditing considerations. This DATE's conference comes at a critical time: Regulators and policymakers around the world are now evaluating changes to practices and structures to address weaknesses revealed by the recent financial crisis. At the same time, accounting standard setters are proposing changes that will, in turn, affect regulatory standards. These changes, along with those made by regulators and policymakers, will help determine the speed and the durability of the global financial system's revitalization. Further, the accounting and regulatory changes made now will help shape future business models for financial institutions and thus influence credit availability. It is important to ensure that these changes facilitate, not hinder, the decision-making processes that support financial intermediation and economic activity. I would like to spend my time with you DATE talking about current and proposed accounting standards that will, in my opinion, have the greatest impact on the operation and supervision of the U.S. banking system. Before I begin, I should define for you my perspective on these matters. Given my background as a community banker, I feel it is crucial that an accounting regime directly link reported financial condition and performance with the business model and economic purpose of the firm. It is difficult for me to comprehend the value of an accounting regime that doesn't make that link. As a regulator, I focus on the viability of individual financial institutions and the financial system as a whole. To be frank, it has been frustrating to try to assess that viability when the value of an asset is based on the nature of its acquisition rather than the way in which it is managed or the way in which its economic value is likely to be realized. And finally, as an economic policymaker, I fully understand the integral role that financial institutions play in the overall performance of our economy. Equally important are the roles played by those that trade and those that lend and by the securitization markets. And I believe a legitimate case can be made for differences in accounting treatment between them to facilitate financial intermediation and economic activity. You might have guessed by now that I would like to talk primarily about fair value and loan reserve accounting. I should also remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the thinking of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or Board staff. Relevance and reliability I think it might be useful to discuss current and proposed accounting standards by first considering the concepts of relevance and reliability. In terms of relevance, the measurement principle should reflect the manner in which entities actually use financial instruments. In this regard, the business model and risk-management approach taken by the reporting entity - as well as the way in which the value of the instrument itself is likely to be realized - should be factored into the measurement determination. If the business model is predicated on the trading of financial instruments for the realization of value, or other strategies that essentially focus on short-term price movements, then fair value has relevance. In the trading business model, reporting fair value focuses risk management on short-term price movements and in most cases incentivizes management to define the organization's risk appetite and to mitigate risk through hedging or other means. Fair value also incentivizes the entity to raise and maintain capital at a level sufficient to cover the price volatility of its assets. For example, if the business model is an originate-todistribute model, then fair value has relevance. In contrast, if the business model is predicated on the realization of value through the return of principal and yield over the life of the financial instrument, then fair value is less relevant. Consider, for example, a bank that finances the operations of a commercial enterprise. The realization of value will come from the repayment of cash flows. Risk management is based on an assessment of the borrower's creditworthiness and the entity's ability to fund the loan to maturity. In this case, the accounting should incentivize the entity to maintain sufficient funding to hold the instrument to maturity and to hold a sufficient amount of capital to cover potential credit losses through the credit cycle, preferably in a designated reserve. Indeed, the use of fair value could create disincentives for lending to smaller businesses whose credit characteristics are not easily evaluated by the marketplace. Admittedly, some have used the business model argument to manipulate accounting results. But the actions of those entities do not diminish the relevance of the business model to the measurement principle. Indeed, over time if the valuation model is not relevant to the business model, the business model itself is likely to change. Rather, the lesson to be learned from such manipulation is that we - preparers, users and auditors of financial statements - need to be vigilant in evaluating actual business practice, and restrict the use of particular measurement principles to the relevant business models. To this end, safeguards should be implemented to eliminate a firm's ability to overstate gains or understate losses by switching back and forth between business models or by reclassifying assets from one business segment to another. For example, from a regulatory perspective, assets in a financial institution's liquidity reserve, by their nature, imply utility through sale and, therefore, should be valued at market price. In terms of reliability, the measurement principle should reflect the ability of all types of entities to calculate a value within a reasonable range of confidence throughout the economic cycle and the life of the financial instruments. There is a good deal of reliability when the fair value of a financial instrument is observable in an active market.You accountants refer to these observable inputs to fair value as level NUM. As you leave the active markets and get into the so-called level NUM and level NUM inputs to fair value measurements, an entity's ability to reach a consistent fair value or an estimate of fair value within a reasonable range of values for a particular financial instrument significantly diminishes. As the recent financial crisis has shown us, a financial instrument's fair value can vary widely among entities in similar markets. And the existence of wide variability in valuation models makes comparisons between entities difficult if not suspect. The reliability of amortized cost is not as questionable. Amortized cost simply is the amount paid to acquire a financial asset, adjusted for any unaccreted discount or unamortized premium. All entities calculate amortized cost using the same formula. Of course, amortized cost is not a panacea. Entities purchase assets at different times and the timing of expected cash flow changes can result in different measurements for the same financial instruments. If the receipt of future payments is in doubt, impairment must be estimated. The use of a reserve for credit losses helps distinguish between contractual amounts due and payment uncertainty created by economic or borrower-specific conditions. Current accounting standards permit credit reserves only for losses likely to be realized in the short term. Lenders regularly adjust credit standards to achieve life of loan profitability given through-the-cycle estimates of credit loss. They should similarly be able to estimate throughthe-cycle reserves as reliably as short term likely losses. The stress test Accounting treatment issues are critically important in the regulatory evaluation of financial institutions' safety and soundness. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (popularly known as the stress test) provides a window into the likely future of bank supervision as well as the accounting issues encountered by regulators in evaluating capital adequacy. The stress test was a simultaneous, horizontal review of the NUM largest financial institutions in the United States. The review was led by the Federal Reserve, but conducted jointly with other federal banking regulators. In essence, we focused on three key pieces of information - preprovision net revenue, potential losses, and final equity capital. Pre-provision net revenue and potential losses were estimated under two different economic scenarios, a baseline scenario and one that was more stressful. Importantly, losses in the trading book were estimated using indicators of financial stress and market volatility while losses in the loan book were estimated using economic indicators to assess probability of default and projections of asset prices to estimate loss severities. In this way, the stress test held to the principle of relevance, while statistical history provided us with some measure of reliability. The stress test was a forward-looking exercise and losses were estimated over a two-DATE horizon: DATE and DATE. Given that the two-DATE horizon was likely to be one of the most stressful time periods in our history, the credit loss estimates would come closer to approximating through-the-cycle losses than the reserve amounts calculated under current accounting standards. Three of the banks that participated in the stress tests had acquired significant loan portfolios through business combinations. Given the elimination of the pooling-of-interest method, the advent of AICPA Statement of Position NUM-NUM (SOP NUM-NUM) accounting, and the prohibition on presenting an allowance for any acquired pools of loans, it was very challenging to determine the amount of credit risk that was already captured in the carrying amount of these acquired loans. Essentially, we had to determine the level of credit risk that would have been present under the pooling-of-interest method and adjust those amounts under the economic scenarios. Adjusting our measurement of these portfolios for pre-provision net revenue, loan loss, and capital proved quite challenging. I would expect it to be similarly challenging for analysts and investors to make similar adjustments in order to set benchmarks and compare performance, of an individual bank over time or between two or more banks. This is a case where I believe we have experienced a reduction in transparency and have lost valuable credit information on acquired loans. I recognize that the Loan Loss Disclosures project at the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is an attempt to provide some of this information by (NUM) requiring more disclosure of credit risks generally and (NUM) requiring the disclosure of the total carrying amount and the total unpaid principal balance of impaired FAS NUM loans for both loans with and without a related allowance for credit loss. However, reserve coverage and loss ratios are calculated using amounts shown in the financial statements. Allowing different treatment of portfolios acquired through business combinations and originated portfolios will make comparisons difficult and will make norms and averages less meaningful over time. In calculating capital requirements, we treated off-balance-sheet entities as if they were carried on the balance sheet. We consulted with the FASB for the most current thinking about what would be consolidated under the accounting rules they were finalizing. To recap, in the stress test we analyzed NUM financial intermediaries engaged in a mix of trading and lending businesses. We conducted this analysis on behalf of the U.S. taxpayer who had become a primary investor in these institutions. And we analyzed them in a way that, in my opinion, best characterizes the risk and performance of the entities:  We evaluated trading assets on a fair value basis;  We evaluated loan assets on the basis of expected credit loss through an adverse cycle;  We evaluated assets based on the way they were managed rather than the way they were acquired; and  We included assets held both on- and off-balance sheet. And finally, we used this analysis to estimate the capital buffer needed to protect the entity in an adverse scenario. We published both our methodology and our findings. While I am normally firmly opposed to making public confidential supervisory information, in this case, we were able to respond to high levels of uncertainty and speculation by publishing our findings. Marketplace confidence seemed to rise upon the publication of results and the subsequent successful capital raises by the firms. Now that some measure of confidence has been restored and financial strains are receding, it is time to turn our attention to the lessons learned in the crisis. And to ask: How can we prevent future crises? Accounting standard setters, regulators, and policymakers around the world are discussing and proposing preventative measures. Now the challenge lies in integrating those changes smoothly and seamlessly. Accounting issues identified during the crisis A number of groups have analyzed the role that accounting played during the crisis and have made recommendations to strengthen accounting standards and the standard-setting process. Although accounting was not the cause of the financial crisis, certain accounting measures, such as the use of fair value accounting for illiquid financial instruments and the impairment model for loans and debt securities, have drawn considerable attention. Throughout the crisis, there were considerably fewer actual market transactions available for use as reference prices for fair values. At the height of the crisis, there was such little market activity that serious consideration was given to abandoning the use of fair value for a period of time. Even now, the debate continues about whether fair value is the appropriate measurement attribute for debt securities and other financial instruments, particularly in less active markets. Similarly, there were serious concerns about the approaches used to determine the impairment of loans and certain debt securities during the crisis. Some argued that the approaches available inhibited firms from recognizing credit losses on loans sooner and artificially required the recognition of losses on debt securities. Standard setters responded by providing guidance on the determination of fair values in the stressed market environment and the determination of financial instrument impairment. This was a very challenging period for financial statement preparers, users, standard setters, and regulators. FASB and IASB approaches under consideration Standard setters are now actively engaged in the discussion of the appropriate accounting principle for measuring financial instruments. Currently FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) are pursuing measurement approaches that diverge in important ways. FASB's approach would measure all financial instruments (assets and liabilities) at fair value through the income statement or other comprehensive income. This would mean that an entity's business strategy for investing in securities and originating loans would not be taken into account. FASB is willing to disclose the amortized cost of these financial instruments on the balance sheet along with the fair value, but there is a catch. The FASB approach would modify the income statement to include all changes in fair value whether or not they are included in other comprehensive income. Reflecting market value fluctuations of all assets through the income statement would significantly increase the volatility of reported bank earnings, likely leading to changes in risk-management practices. At the extreme, this approach could incent all financial intermediaries to adopt a trading or investment banking business model. On the other hand, IASB's approach would measure financial instruments at amortized cost if they have characteristics of a basic loan and are managed on a yield basis. Under the IASB approach, characteristics of a basic loan are fairly narrowly defined. For example, only the most senior tranche of an asset securitization might qualify for amortized cost. Similarly, any loan with any unusual provision might not qualify for amortized cost. This approach would measure all other financial instruments at fair value predominantly through the income statement. There is a narrow exception for fair valuing certain strategic equity investments through other comprehensive income. Consistent with the FASB approach, the IASB approach would modify the income statement to include all changes in fair value whether or not they are included in other comprehensive income. By now, you have gotten the picture that both of the approaches under consideration would constitute a significant departure from current practice. Both of these proposals raise a number of concerns for me:  From the standpoint of relevance and reliability, the FASB and IASB approaches would not accurately reflect the traditional commercial banking model. Indeed, the imbedded incentives would actually favor \"originate to distribute\" rather than \"originate and hold\" lending models.  Second, we have very little actual experience in fair valuing liabilities. Using fair value for liabilities introduces a new set of incentives and risk exposures for management.  Thirdly, no market currently exists for non-government-guaranteed, small business loans. The lack of fair value information for these types of loans could actually discourage small business lending.  Fourth: Smaller banking companies likely will incur substantial costs and experience great difficulty in applying the new standards. But will financial statement users see any real benefit?  And finally, the two Boards are planning to exchange views and work products, but are not duty-bound to achieving a single converged standard. If the approaches are implemented along different timelines in the United States and abroad, they could bring the two sets of standards further apart and possibly incent some governmental bodies to mandate an approach in order to level the playing field. Retaining both lending and trading models My preference would be for standards that recognize both lending and trading business models for financial intermediation even when they exist within the same firm. My wish list would include the following:  Trading assets shown at fair value with market value gains and losses recognized through the income statement;  Assets held for secondary liquidity shown at fair value with market value gains and losses recognized in the capital account through other comprehensive income;  Assets held to maturity and managed for yield and return of principal over time shown at amortized cost with a reserve reflecting life-of-loan or through-the-cycle potential credit losses; and  For business combinations, identical accounting treatment for acquired assets and similarly managed assets on the acquirer's balance sheet. Regulatory changes In terms of regulatory changes, our current regulatory capital framework needs to be revised to ensure that banking organizations have a level of capital sufficient to facilitate lending, while also ensuring safe and sound operation throughout the economic cycle. Work is underway to develop an approach that would allow banks to retain more capital in good economic times and to allow this excess or buffer to be reduced as the economic cycle worsens. The goal is to have a level of capital that is sufficient to support lending, while maintaining safety and soundness. The challenge is to develop an appropriate target for this excess amount and to identify the right economic trigger for determining when this excess should be reduced. This is a delicate balance. In addition, the elements that we consider to be tier NUM capital in our current framework need to be revised. Since our framework starts with components of equity capital as measured under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we are carefully evaluating every element of regulatory capital that is treated differently in regulatory capital than in GAAP. For example, GAAP equity includes accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and the current regulatory framework neutralizes the impact of certain items in AOCI such as unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. And finally we are coordinating capital standard setting with our counterparts in other countries. To the extent that GAAP and accounting standards in those countries are different, our capital definitions may also differ. Impact on securitization Finally, I'd like to offer a quick word of caution on accounting for off-balance-sheet items and the future of securitization markets. Our financial system has become dependent upon securitization as an important intermediation tool. During the crisis, securitization markets ground to a halt. The Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) has helped restart activity in some markets, such as securities backed by auto loans or credit card receivables. But the CMBS market is still very weak and the market for newly issued, private-label RMBS remains closed. And although the TALF has been successful, it is a short-term facility that was only intended to give the markets and policymakers time to restructure the securitization model to make the securitization markets more viable going forward. The recent G20 agreement calls for a retention of risk, or \"skin-in-the-game\" approach for asset securitizations. It also calls for higher capital standards and a leverage ratio for all banks. If the risk retention requirements, combined with accounting standards governing the treatment of off-balance-sheet entities, make it impossible for firms to reduce the balance sheet through securitization and if, at the same time, leverage ratios limit balance sheet growth, we could be faced with substantially less credit availability. I'm not arguing with the accounting standards or the regulatory direction. I am just saying they must be coordinated to avoid potentially limiting the free flow of credit. We will learn more about the impact of the new accounting rules on securitization activities as banking organizations implement the new standards. We will also learn more about the impact of our regulatory capital regime on securitization activities as we evaluate the responses to our proposed changes to the regulatory capital guidelines. In the past, accounting rules and regulatory capital guidelines have been drivers for how the securitization model has been structured. As policymakers and others work to create a new framework for securitization, we need to be mindful of falling into the trap of letting either the accounting or regulatory capital drive us to the wrong model. This may mean we have to revisit the accounting or regulatory capital in order to achieve our objectives for a viable securitization market. A healthy economy needs an array of tools for financial intermediation and we need to be careful not to be overly punitive to this particular tool. We just need to focus on providing the appropriate incentives, oversight, and accountability. Conclusion The financial crisis has certainly highlighted the need for a safe and stable financial system. To promote confidence and attract capital to the system, we need financial statements that provide maximum insight into the financial condition and risk positions of financial intermediaries. We need supervisory oversight and regulatory constraints, such as regulatory capital, that provide safeguards and incentives that support our objectives of prudent provision of credit and sustainable economic activity. And the accounting and supervisory frameworks need to recognize and support all viable forms of financial intermediation regardless of whether it occurs in the traditional lending model, the trading model, the securitization model, or some other business model. In this regard, I believe it is important to show in the statements themselves the numbers needed to construct ratio analysis between firms or of individual firms across time. Finally, I believe that accounting standard setters, regulatory bodies, and lawmakers have a vested interest in working together to ensure the oversight mechanisms, reporting frameworks, and other elements of the revitalized financial system operate in a manner that is both stable and efficient.",

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Improving risk management in light of recent market events Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Global Association of Risk Management Professionals Annual Risk Convention, New York, DATE.    I am delighted to have been invited by GARP to share a few of my thoughts about risk management practices at financial institutions. Recent events remind us that markets can be quite complex and difficult to predict and that sound risk management is fundamental to the health and resiliency of both individual financial institutions and financial markets generally. DATE I want to highlight two fundamental elements of sound risk management: information and incentives. These two elements lie at the very heart of good risk management. Information is vital to good decisionmaking, and incentives send the right signals and create beneficial outcomes both within individual institutions and to the financial system as a whole. I should note that my thoughts on recent events are preliminary. Because risk-management challenges have affected a number of global institutions, we are working very closely with our supervisory counterparts in other countries to learn from recent events and to coordinate with financial institutions in determining what additional steps may need to be taken. As part of this important international effort, we should seek to align market participants' incentives with our own supervisory objectives; otherwise, behavior will not be altered appropriately and the proposed remedies will not prove durable. Key elements of sound risk management As is well known to the impressive international group of risk professionals in this audience, models are critical to understanding the nuances of risks embedded in complex financial transactions and portfolios, but I am sure all of you would agree that sophisticated techniques cannot be relied upon without the proper risk-management foundation. Integral to this foundation are timely and accurate information and the will and ability to act on it. Since the fortunes of even the most technically sophisticated financial institutions ultimately depend on the decisions and judgments of individual managers and traders, senior management must ensure that the right incentives are in place so that risk taking is appropriately captured in business-line performance evaluation and employee compensation. Senior management must understand the risks assumed by each individual business line and communicate the firm's strategy and risk appetite back down to those business lines. At the same time, senior management must send each business-line manager clear signals about which risk levels are tolerable and which practices are not acceptable. In this way, information and incentives are threads of sound risk management that must be woven into the fabric of each firm's management culture. Enterprise-wide risk assessments A good risk-management structure must encompass risks across the entire firm, gathering and processing information on an enterprise-wide basis in real time. Good information is the lifeblood of sound risk management. In short, you cannot manage your risks if you do not know what they are. Managers of financial institutions need to ensure that they fully understand the risks assumed by each of their institutions' business lines, and for that they need high-quality information - both qualitative and quantitative. Aggregating information across a large, diversified financial institution is not easy and should be done with appropriate care and with adequate resources for checking timeliness and veracity. Risk managers should live by the adage \"Trust but verify,\" being careful not to rely on assessments or data from others without conducting proper due diligence. It is also worth noting that financial institutions should gather a wide range of relevant information before they see market troubles brewing. In other words, scrambling for information once turbulence sets in is not good practice. Understanding a firm's true risk exposures requires examining not just risks on the balance sheet, but also off-balance-sheet risks that are sometimes more difficult to identify and often not so easy to quantify. Latent risks from certain complex products and certain risky activities should be properly recognized, because they can manifest themselves when market turbulence sets in. Stress testing and scenario analysis are of paramount importance here. Even when risks are properly identified and measured, that information needs to be presented to senior management and to others in the firm who can use it in their decisionmaking, and presented in a timely way. In other words, information should be adequately distributed both vertically and horizontally. Adequate distribution of information allows for an enterprise-wide perspective on risks that affect the whole organization. Information must be provided up to senior management, but their views and analysis then must be sent back down through the business lines. To put it another way, institutions should develop an \"information circulatory system\" to ensure the flow of information that is crucial to the health of the firm. It is also clear that financial institutions should draw on several types of information from various sources when assessing their risks, particularly when dealing with complex products. No single source of information is perfect or adequate. Management benefits from having a number of tools at its disposal to assess risk positions that draw on differing underlying assumptions. Properly designed, these tools offer different perspectives on exposures and are flexible enough to allow perspectives on risk to change as business conditions change and new data become available. Governance structure To ensure sound risk management, boards of directors and senior management at financial institutions must also establish an overall governance and control structure that is credible, robust, and consistent throughout the firm. It is critical that senior management set the tone at the top, communicate it, and lead by example. This strategy should be clearly articulated and should be recognizable in the actions of the firm's employees. Business lines should be held equally accountable and there should not be any special treatment for \"star\" employees, even if they are bringing sizable revenues into the institution in DATE. While certain financial institutions may choose to conduct business on a decentralized basis, they must always remember that in the end the exposures and obligations are rolled up and combined into one consolidated legal entity. In addition, the institution's commitment to and emphasis on risk management should be eminently visible - both within and outside of the organization. For example, the firm should demonstrate that its risk managers have direct access to top management and play a key role in decisionmaking. They also must be able to speak authoritatively about the risk profile and risk-management strategy of the whole organization to market participants and counterparties. Durability of risk-management structures Of course, risk-management structures are successful only if they are sturdy and durable. These structures and their associated strategies should be embedded in the firm's culture and not be dependent on just one or a few people. They should be part of the fabric of the organization, not just a few catchy phrases repeated from time to time. For example, understanding and living up to the firm's risk-management standards should be a prerequisite for advancement to a senior management position. Effective risk management remains sturdy and durable only if supported by strong and independent risk functions that produce unbiased information. Having independent risk managers with a certain amount of authority allows for clear, dispassionate thinking about the entire firm's risk profile, with no favoritism toward any business unit. Senior management should encourage risk managers to dig deep to uncover latent risks and point out cases in which certain business lines are assuming too much risk. In other words, it is good to have a few people within the institution who - to paraphrase a former Federal Reserve Chairman - know when to take away the punch bowl. Being the party pooper, however, can be very difficult in any organization, and that is why it is crucial for the risk manager to be known as an independent voice who is influential with top management. Ensuring adherence to risk-management practices Any successful organization needs to develop appropriate mechanisms to ensure adherence to and sustainability of its risk-management structures, and incentives structures are a key mechanism for this purpose. Appropriate incentives reward good behavior and penalize inappropriate behavior. Of course, incentives work best when they are known well in advance, that is, when they serve as ex ante signals of what should and should not be done. Naturally, in very large organizations it is difficult for senior management to monitor each individual, so incentives need to be consistent, permeate even the lowest levels of the organization, and remind each individual that his or her risk-taking affects the whole enterprise. Limits and controls can be useful tools for creating the right incentives and sending appropriate signals, but they of course need to be tailored individually to each firm. Problems can arise when incentives are not properly structured and appropriate \"risk discipline\" is not exercised - for example, when limits and controls are not set or, if they are set, when adherence to them is not monitored or enforced. Such controls are incentives for businessline leaders to assume only the risks that the firm can absorb because they penalize those who try to take on excessive risk or inadequate mitigation in the name of short-term profit maximization. One good practice is to have reliable, interconnected enforcement mechanisms within the institution, mechanisms that can - and will - enforce limits. An example is a good centralized treasury function. Risk-adjusted performance evaluation and compensation In trading and certain other activities, there is a tendency for business-line heads or individual employees to focus on their short-term compensation and not think about the longterm risks that their activities create for the firm. But it is the responsibility of senior management to provide the proper incentives and controls to counter the potential for individuals within financial firms to discount risks to the broader institution, and of course to ensure that nefarious activity is promptly uncovered and stopped. Clearly, it is up to financial institutions themselves - not bank supervisors - to decide how compensation should be structured, but managers and boards of directors should understand the consequences of providing too many short-term and one-sided incentives. They would benefit from thinking about compensation on more of a risk-adjusted basis. Accordingly, I encourage institutions to think about ways to alter existing compensation schemes to include some types of deferred compensation, since the risks of certain investments or trades may not manifest themselves in the near term. Thus, it makes sense to try to match the tenor of compensation with the tenor of the risk profile and thus explicitly to take into account the longer-run performance of the portfolio or division in which the employee operates. This type of compensation arrangement is already in use at many nonfinancial firms. Of course, star performers may prefer to have compensation more front-loaded and threaten to leave a firm for another one that would not have the same longer-term risk-sensitive compensation structure. It is important for firms to have the flexibility to choose how they reward their employees, but it may be valuable to consider the development of industry-wide principles of sound risk management that would touch upon incentive-compensation issues. Such principles could foster market discipline in firms if investors were to view the principles as best practices and were to more heavily discount the reported short-term earnings of firms that failed to adopt best practices. Although reaching consensus on principles for compensation would be difficult, it seems well worth the effort. Reflecting risk-management practices outside the firm Information and incentives play an important role not just within an institution, but also outside it. By this I mean the ability of the marketplace - and supervisors, when necessary - to gather information about financial institutions and give the right signals to bank management about risk taking. Naturally, this requires proper disclosure of information by the financial institution so that depositors, counterparties, shareholders, and other market participants can judge the riskiness of the institution and act accordingly. Institutions that are able to provide a continual and accurate flow of information to market participants generally benefit from such transparency. Certainly, this is an important part of the motivation behind pillar NUM of the new Basel II capital rules emphasizing the role of public disclosure. This benefit can be even more prominent during financial turbulence, when market participants become fearful of latent risks and \"surprise\" losses. Confidence in the risk-management practices of individual firms can be valuable in maintaining confidence in the markets in which they operate. Risk-management performance during recent market events Although some of the risk-management techniques applied during DATE were successful, in other areas challenges remain. In risk identification and quantification, as well as liquidity-risk management, for example, the importance of information and incentives is evident. A number of risk-measurement and risk-quantification challenges relate to valuation practices, particularly with new products. As I noted in a speech DATE, firms should have greater motivation for applying proper valuation practices as part of good risk management.NUM At the center of these practices is the ability to make appropriate judgments about the quality of information being used for valuations. The process usually starts with an initial experimentation phase in which market participants learn a great deal about the product's expected performance and risk characteristics, preferably under different market conditions. Conducting due diligence about new products can be costly and take time, but it is usually worth it. Unfortunately, in some recent cases new products were developed very quickly and not properly road tested. In observing the valuation challenges, the \"Trust but verify\" adage has equal application. Market participants must ensure that they do not make valuation decisions based solely on excessive reliance on external ratings or evaluations, but that they also undertake their own assessment. And I would suggest that the value of independent due diligence on the part of market participants is especially high for newer and more-complex products. We all know that reductions in market liquidity played a large role in recent events, affecting the valuation of financial products. As with other risk areas, a number of practices were applied over DATE to identify and try to quantify the potential for disruptions in market liquidity. Good practices included attempts by business lines and trading desks to embed market-liquidity premiums or to apply market-liquidity haircuts in pricing models and valuations. That is, there was an understanding that information in benign periods did not reveal the full set of potential outcomes, and that disruption of market liquidity had the potential to affect market prices by driving down the value of certain instruments and to create losses. Conversely, problems arose when some managers did not make marketliquidity adjustments in their quantitative estimates and models and simply relied on recent information from good times, when there was ample liquidity. The Basel Committee's working group on liquidity began an exercise to review liquiditysupervision practices DATE and DATE issued a public report that builds on the Basel sound practices for managing liquidity risk issued in DATE. The report emphasizes that financial institutions should conduct stress tests and contingency planning exercises to prepare for potential problems in both funding and market liquidity, capturing market-wide events, events affecting multiple markets or currencies simultaneously, and the combination of idiosyncratic and market-wide shocks. In conducting this analysis, firms should better integrate stress tests and contingency funding plans. As with other risk areas, weaker performance in funding and liquidity-risk management can sometimes stem from inadequate information and poor incentives. During recent events, firmwide liquidity-management strategies were most effective when they included proper incentives and all relevant information, including information about the potential for certain exposures to be added to a firm's balance sheet - so-called unplanned asset expansions. Successful plans also contained information about the potential liquidity needs of individual business lines and how those might affect funding for the entire organization. In other words, individual business lines were instructed to evaluate their likely needs for funding and relate those needs to the treasury function. In some cases, managers have considered the potential adverse liquidity outcomes from engaging in certain businesses and therefore have decided to limit their involvement or stay out of those activities altogether. Concluding thoughts The banking industry has the primary responsibility for fostering a culture of effective risk management, but of course supervisors have their own role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of individual firms and a viable financial system. Therefore, both should continue to work hard to improve risk management in light of recent market events. U.S. supervisors are cooperating with their counterparts in other countries to help the industry address risk-management issues - bilaterally as well as through international forums such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Forum. I am delighted to represent the Federal Reserve in both forums. Of course, appropriate remedies will not be developed TIME and, when they are developed, may take some time to implement. Institutions should make appropriate adjustments to risk management and should do so thoughtfully and carefully. Indeed, firms should focus on long-term improvements in their risk-management culture and remember that practicing good risk management is an ongoing process that needs to be continually updated and reviewed for its efficacy. Given the challenges in information flows and incentives I highlighted earlier, firms should devote particular attention to these two areas. Even an institution that was relatively untouched by recent events should remain vigilant about the next potential source of turbulence, to ensure that it is prepared to analyze information about its risk exposures and distribute that information throughout the firm. Going forward, therefore, senior management at financial institutions should ensure that they have complete and timely information about risk and demonstrate the ability and will to act on it. They should also be aware that the next crisis could come precisely in the area where they are most exposed or have weaknesses. That is, a certain degree of humility is wise, because all firms have a limited understanding of what might happen next. All senior managers would benefit from taking a fresh look at the incentive structures within their firm. For example, are all parties being compensated on a risk-adjusted basis that takes into account longer-term performance? Is management able to determine how risk taking at the business-unit level affects firm-wide risks? Do business units have the right incentives to consider their units' risk taking in the context of the entire institution? These and other questions deserve attention, given some of the risk-management challenges seen lately. But I am confident that the industry can find appropriate solutions, and supervisors will assist them in those efforts.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: The Community Reinvestment Act - its evolution and new challenges Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Community Affairs Research Conference, Washington DC, DATE.    This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Enacted in DATE, the CRA affirmed the obligation of federally insured depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of communities in which they are chartered, consistent with safe and sound operations. The act also charged the federal bank regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, with implementing the CRA through regulations and with examining banks and thrifts to determine whether they meet their CRA obligations. The CRA presents an interesting case study of a regulatory regime that has evolved to adjust to changes in the economic, financial, and social environment. Since the CRA's enactment, the implementing regulations have been substantially amended three times--in DATE, and DATE. In each case, changes to the regulations reflected both experience gained in the implementation of the law as well as ongoing developments in financial markets and the economy. In my remarks DATE, I will survey some milestones in the evolution of the CRA, beginning with a description of the economic and social concerns that prompted the passage of the act. With this brief history as background, I will comment on the challenges we face in ensuring that the CRA remains effective and relevant in the future. The origins of the Community Reinvestment Act Public and congressional concerns about the deteriorating condition of America's cities, particularly lower-income and minority neighborhoods, led to the enactment of the Community Reinvestment Act. In the view of many, urban decay was partly a consequence of limited credit availability, which encouraged urban flight and inhibited the rehabilitation of declining neighborhoods. Some critics pinned the blame for the lack of credit availability on mainstream financial institutions, which they characterized as willing to accept deposits from households and small businesses in lower-income neighborhoods but unwilling to lend or invest in those same neighborhoods despite the presence of creditworthy borrowers. Several social and economic factors help explain why credit to lower-income neighborhoods was limited at that time. First, racial discrimination in lending undoubtedly adversely affected local communities. Discriminatory lending practices had deep historical roots. The term \"redlining,\" which refers to the practice of designating certain lower-income or minority neighborhoods as ineligible for credit, appears to have originated in DATE, when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board asked the Home Owners' Loan Corporation to create \"residential security maps\" for NUM cities that would indicate the level of security for real estate investments in each surveyed city.NUM The resulting maps designated four categories of lending and investment risk, each with a letter and color designation. Type \"D\" areas, those considered to be the riskiest for lending and which included many neighborhoods with predominantly African-American populations, were color-coded red on the maps--hence the term \"redlining\" (Federal Home Loan Bank Board, DATE). Private lenders reportedly constructed similar maps that were used to determine credit availability and terms. The DATE Report on Housing by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights reported practices that included requiring high down payments and rapid amortization schedules for African-American borrowers as well as blanket refusals to lend in particular areas. Besides discrimination a variety of economic and institutional factors help to explain the relative unavailability of credit in lower-income neighborhoods.NUM DATE, the secondary market for mortgages was rudimentary at best, which limited local loan originators' access to capital and reduced their ability to diversify credit risks geographically.NUM Informational problems also inhibited lending in some urban areas. For example, relative to higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income areas tend to have fewer home sales and more-diverse housing structures, making accurate appraisal more difficult4. Similarly, credit evaluations tend to be more costly for lower-income borrowers, who are relatively more likely to have short or irregular credit histories.NUM Informational barriers to lending were heightened by the absence of uniform national depositories of information on the credit experiences of consumers; at the time, the credit-reporting system consisted of hundreds of local credit bureaus, each of which maintained limited information on local residents.NUM The high costs of gathering information, together with the difficulty of keeping information proprietary, may have created a \"first-mover\" problem, in which each financial institution has an incentive to let one of its competitors be the first to enter an underserved market. Without some coordination, the first-mover problem may result in no institution choosing to incur the costs of entry (Lang and Nakamura, DATE; Barr, DATE; and Ling, DATE). The regulatory environment of the period was yet another factor limiting broad access to credit. State and federal rules prohibited interstate branching or acquisitions and in some cases restricted even intrastate branching, reducing competition and the ability of lenders to diversify geographic risk.NUM Also, interest rate ceilings on mortgages in some locations effectively blocked lending to potential borrowers judged to pose higher risks, and interest rate ceilings on deposits (notably, the infamous Regulation Q) led to periodic episodes of disintermediation and reduced availability of mortgage credit (Chomsisengphet and Pennington-Cross, DATE; and McNeil and Rechter, DATE). Taken together, these social, economic, and regulatory factors contributed to the perception that banking institutions were failing to adequately serve the credit needs of some residents of their communities, a concern that led the Congress to enact the CRA. The CRA reaffirmed the longstanding principle that financial institutions must serve \"the convenience and needs,\" including credit needs, of the communities in which they are chartered. The obligation of financial institutions to serve their communities was seen as a quid pro quo for privileges such as the protection afforded by federal deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve's discount window (FFIEC, DATE). Indeed, the Bank Holding Company Act, passed in DATE, had already required the Federal Reserve Board, when ruling on proposed acquisitions by banks or bank holding companies, to evaluate how well the institutions involved were meeting community needs, consistent with the requirements of safety and soundness. The CRA was only one of a series of laws passed during DATE intended to reduce credit-related discrimination, expand access to credit, and shed light on lending patterns. The CRA itself focused on the provision of credit to low- and moderate-income communities rather than on discrimination by race, sex, or other personal characteristics. Legislation that addressed discrimination in lending explicitly included the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act was enacted to increase transparency in the mortgage lending market and to support public and NUM Debate continues on the relative importance of racial bias and economic factors for explaining redlining and similar practices (see Lacker, DATE). NUM The Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds accounts did not even record private securitization activity until the early DATEs, and purchases by federal housing agencies, which were focused on government-backed loans and lower-risk conventional loans, represented less than NUM percent of total outstanding home mortgage debt in DATE preceding enactment of the CRA. NUM Analysis of decennial census and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data indicates that lower-income areas have about half the number of owner-occupied homes and home purchase loans in DATE than do higher-income areas. NUM Although information from the period before the CRA is not available, a review of credit records from one of the national credit-reporting agencies DATE supports this conjecture, as it finds that individuals in lower-income areas have, on average, substantially shorter credit histories and only about half as many credit accounts. Also, nearly NUM percent of the individuals in lower-income census tracts cannot be scored, a proportion nearly three times that found in higher-income areas. This information comes from analysis by staff members of the Federal Reserve Board in conjunction with a report to the Congress (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, forthcoming). NUM The low-cost summary measures of credit history that have gained widespread market acceptance DATE did not emerge until DATE, when Fair Isaac and Company developed the FICO score. NUM For a listing of these rules, see Amel and Keane (DATE). BIS Review NUM/DATE private investment activity. From an economic perspective, the CRA can be interpreted as an attempt to rectify market failures--for example, by inducing banks to invest in building the knowledge and expertise necessary to lend profitably in lower-income neighborhoods. Similarly, to the extent that the CRA encouraged coordinated or simultaneous efforts by banks to lend in underserved areas, it had the potential to reduce the first-mover problem. The debate surrounding the passage of the CRA was contentious, with critics charging that the law would distort credit markets, create unnecessary regulatory burden, and lead to unsound lending. Partly in response to these concerns, the Congress included little prescriptive detail in the law. Instead, the CRA simply directs the banking regulatory agencies to ensure that banks serve the credit needs of their local communities in a safe and sound manner. In effect, the agencies were left with considerable discretion and flexibility to modify the rules in light of changes in the economy and in financial markets (Garwood and Smith, DATE). At times, this discretion has been the source of some uncertainty on the part of regulated institutions concerned with compliance. However, the flexibility has proved valuable in allowing the CRA to remain relevant despite rapid economic and financial change and widely differing economic circumstances among neighborhoods. The evolution of the CRA For DATE after its enactment, the CRA was a rather low-profile banking regulation, one that set minimal compliance requirements for depository institutions and attracted limited supervisory attention from the bank regulatory agencies.NUM By the late DATEs, however, the issues surrounding access to credit were attracting renewed interest. In response to this interest, the Congress included in the Financial Institution Reform and Recovery Act of DATE (FIRREA) an amendment to the CRA statute to require public disclosure of institutions' ratings and performance evaluations. FIRREA also expanded data collection and made public certain data reported under the HMDA. With the requisite data becoming available, advocacy groups, researchers, and other analysts began to perform moresophisticated, quantitative analyses of banks' records in meeting the credit needs of their communities. Further attention to CRA was generated by the surge in bank merger and acquisition activities that followed the enactment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of DATE. As public scrutiny of bank merger and acquisition activity escalated, advocacy groups increasingly used the public comment process to protest bank applications on CRA grounds. In instances of highly contested applications, the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies held public meetings to allow the public and the applicants to comment on the lending records of the banks in question. In response to these new pressures, banks began to devote more resources to their CRA programs. Many institutions established separate business units and subsidiary community development corporations to facilitate lending that would be given favorable consideration in CRA examinations. Local and regional public-private partnerships and multibank loan consortia also gained more prominence as banks developed strategies for expanding and managing CRA-related activities. Even as these developments were occurring, extensive change was taking place in the financial services sector. During the DATEs and DATE, technological progress significantly improved data collection and information processing, which led to the development and widespread use of creditscoring models and the availability of generic credit history scores. Deregulation also contributed to the changes in the marketplace. Notably, the lifting of prohibitions against interstate banking was followed by an increased pace of industry consolidation. Also, the preemption of usury laws on home loans created more scope for risk-based pricing of mortgages. Securitization of affordable housing loans expanded, as did the secondary market for those loans, in part reflecting a DATE law that required the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to devote a percentage of their activities to meeting affordable housing goals (HUD, DATE). A generally strong economy and lower interest rates also helped improved access to credit by lower-income households. Bankers were also gaining experience in underwriting and managing the risk of lending in lowerincome communities. After DATE of experimentation, the managers of financial institutions found that these loan portfolios, if properly underwritten and managed, could be profitable. In fact, a Federal Reserve study found that, generally, CRA-related lending activity was at least somewhat profitable and usually did not involve disproportionately higher levels of default (Avery, Bostic, and Canner, DATE; see also Board of Governors, DATE). Moreover, community groups and nonprofit organizations began to take a more businesslike, market-oriented approach to local economic development, leading them to establish more-formalized and more-productive partnerships with banks. Community groups provided information to financial institutions on the needs of lower-income communities for credit and services, offered financial education and counseling services to community members, and referred \"bankable\" customers to partner banks. Specialized community development banks and financial institutions with the mission of providing financial services and credit to lower-income communities and families emerged and grew. Policy developments bolstered the infrastructure and funding of community development lending organizations. Notably, the passage of the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Act of DATE created the CDFI Fund at the Department of Treasury. The expansion of CDFIs provided banks with access to new opportunities to finance community economic development. Other initiatives, such as the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit and New Markets Tax Credit programs provided vehicles for investing in affordable housing development and economic revitalization in distressed communities. Even as CRA-related lending became more extensive and more market-based, concerns were expressed about the implementation of the law. Financial institutions complained about compliance costs (Elliehausen, DATE). Both bankers and community groups criticized the CRA examination procedures as emphasizing process over results, arguing that the examination criteria were too subjective and that a more-quantitative system for evaluating institutions' CRA performance should be developed. In response to these criticisms, President Clinton in DATE directed the agencies that implement CRA to review and revise the regulations, with the goals of clarifying performance standards, making examinations and evaluations more consistent, and reducing the compliance burden. The CRA regulations adopted in DATE established for large institutions a three-pronged test based on performance in the areas of lending, investments, and services. While the regulations placed the greatest emphasis on lending, they encouraged innovative approaches to addressing community development credit needs. Several provisions were included to reduce compliance costs, among them a new rule that allowed small banks to meet their requirements by means of a streamlined examination focused on lending activities.NUM When the new regulations were adopted, the agencies committed themselves to reviewing the regulations in DATE to assess their effectiveness. The promised review made use of extensive public comment and scholarly research on the efficacy of CRA programs. In their comments on the proposed revisions to the rules, bankers and community organizations generally agreed that the fundamental elements of the regulations were sound and that the agencies should maintain the overall structure of the DATE regulations, although each group raised a number of specific issues. Findings from the research by Board staff members, in combination with the public comments, led the agencies to propose new definitions for \"small\" banks, which would be subject only to a lending test to assess compliance with the CRA, and for \"intermediate small\" banks, which would be subject to a lending test as well as a new and more-flexible community development test (Avery, Canner, Mok, and Sokolov, DATE). In addition, the research underscored the benefit of expanding the definition of \"community development\" to include activities benefiting middle-income communities in distressed rural areas and in disaster areas. The final rule was adopted in DATE DATE. In each of the major regulatory revisions, the goal of the regulators has been to increase the effectiveness of the CRA in promoting the economic development of lower-income communities while reducing the associated compliance burden. Again, making progress toward achieving these goals has been made easier by the flexibility of the original statute, which has allowed the regulators to adapt the rules to changing market and economic circumstances and to give financial institutions the latitude to meet their CRA obligations in diverse and cost-effective ways. Has the CRA achieved its objectives? Research on the CRA has tended to find positive net effects, but the results are not uniform. A paper by Board staff members compared census tracts just above and below the low- and moderate-income threshold, finding that the tracts below the threshold had higher homeownership rates, higher growth in owner-occupied units, and lower vacancy rates than would have otherwise been predicted (Avery, Calem, and Canner, DATE). An analysis by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies concluded that the CRA has expanded access to residential mortgages for lower-income borrowers, but that research also finds that the CRA's effect is diminishing as mortgage lending by nonbank institutions expands (Apgar and Duda, DATE). Yet another review concludes that the CRA has been effective in helping to overcome market failures and reduce discrimination at a relatively low cost, precisely because the CRA sets forth a flexible standard rather than a rule (Barr, DATE). However, some critical studies have argued that the CRA has been ineffective in addressing discrimination and market failures and that its social costs outweigh its benefits (see, for example, Hylton, DATE, and Barr, DATE). The CRA is clearly far from perfect. Although its objectives are broad and ambitious, its net effects on lower-income neighborhoods are difficult to measure with precision.NUM Addressing CRA responsibilities also imposes costs on financial institutions. It appears that, at least in some instances, the CRA has served as a catalyst, inducing banks to enter underserved markets that they might otherwise have ignored. At its most successful, the CRA may have had a multiplier effect, supplementing its direct impact by stimulating new market-based, profit-driven economic activity in lower-income neighborhoods. The future of the CRA As we look forward, the CRA will have to continue evolving to reflect the ongoing changes in financial markets and in the economy more generally. I will conclude by flagging just a few of the issues that will remain important for the implementation and the effect of CRA. First, for some institutions the concept of the \"local community\" is no longer as clear as it was when the CRA was enacted. DATE, some institutions are not identified with a particular community but are regional or national in scope, which inevitably makes the definition of the relevant assessment areas somewhat difficult. Moreover, to an increasing extent, banks use nontraditional avenues--the Internet, for example--to interact with customers, in some cases avoiding a bricks-and-mortar presence altogether. To date, defining \"local community\" for the purposes of CRA assessment has been manageable as most banks still lend in local communities where they have deposit-taking facilities or branches. However, if these trends continue, defining a \"local community\" may become increasingly difficult, and the concept eventually may require reconsideration by regulators or even the Congress. Second, changes in the structure of the financial industry have resulted in many financial transactions that fell under the CRA umbrella in DATE having become increasingly the province of nondepositories not subject to CRA, including companies owned by banks or bank holding companies. Holding companies' nonbank affiliates, for instance, can be included in the CRA assessment of the banking institution at the discretion of the bank but need not be. Most mortgages are now packaged by brokers, and nearly two in three mortgages are originated by nondepositories not covered by the CRA.NUM Nonbank institutions, such as DATE lenders, check cashers, and remittance agents, are important sources of financial services in low- and moderate-income communities. In some cases, nonbank service providers offer convenience to customers but at prices that have raised concerns (Carr and Schuetz, DATE, and Barr, DATE). Some observers have suggested extending the CRA to nonbank providers, but this proposal neglects a fundamental premise of the CRA legislation--that banks incur special obligations in exchange for the advantages conferred by their charters, such as deposit insurance. Of course, the CRA is not the only tool for addressing such issues, should it be determined that consumers are not adequately protected in their dealings with nonbanks. The CRA may nevertheless have some role to play; for example, a possible question to consider is whether increasing the focus on services by banking institutions might encourage them to compete more actively with nonbank providers in lower-income neighborhoods. Third, access to credit in lower-income communities is obviously much greater DATE than when the CRA was enacted. This greater access has had tangible benefits, such as the increase in homeownership rates (Joint Center for Housing Studies, DATE). However, recent problems in mortgage markets illustrate that an underlying assumption of the CRA--that more lending equals better outcomes for local communities may not always hold.NUM Whether, and if so, how to try to differentiate \"good\" from \"bad\" lending in the CRA context is an issue that is likely to challenge us for some time. One possible strategy is to place more weight in CRA examinations on factors such as whether an institution provides services complementary to lending--for example, counseling and financial education. The CRA was created to help ensure lower-income communities have access to credit and financial services. When it passed the legislation, the Congress could not have foreseen the extensive changes in financial markets and the economy that have occurred over the past thirty DATE; thus, the decision to write the statute broadly and with considerable flexibility appears wise in retrospect. In implementing the law, the banking agencies have tried to learn from market developments, from research, and from the comments of financial institutions, consumers, and other interested parties. The regulations have thus changed over time in response to the changing financial landscape and as we have learned more about what works and what doesn't. We do not know how the economy and the financial system will change in DATE, but it is safe to assume that change will be rapid. Considerable creativity and flexibility will thus be necessary to ensure that the CRA continues to assist community economic development without placing an undue burden on financial institutions.

                  "Mark W Olson: Community development and the bigger picture Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Social Compact Visionary Awards, Washington DC, DATE.    I appreciate the opportunity to join you TIME to recognize the successes of an impressive list of community revitalization projects. Having observed the revitalization of Washington, D.C., over a number of DATE, I am particularly pleased to be here at the Tivoli Theatre and see first-hand the work that has been done to restore this historic theater and bring new activity and investment to the Columbia Heights neighborhood. As I look around, it is hard to believe that such an architectural gem sat vacant for DATE. The restoration of the Tivoli honors the past while helping serve the residential, commercial, retail, and cultural needs of Columbia Heights residents. It is a fine example of the transformative power of investments in older, urban neighborhoods. Projects such as this would not be possible without the strategic vision and commitment of community, business, and government leaders. It is that vision we are here to celebrate TIME. I would like to begin by offering a review of the overall economic climate DATE and the prospects for business investment generally. Then, to borrow a phrase from Social Compact, I will \"drill down\" to highlight a number of the elements that I believe are important in making sound investment decisions, particularly in underserved areas of our inner cities. Finally, I will offer a few other observations about the state of the community development industry as I see it. Macroeconomic conditions The recent news on the U.S. economy has been, on the whole, quite positive. Adjusted for inflation, gross domestic product increased at a brisk rate in DATE. Gains in consumer spending and business investment were particularly strong. To be sure, most forecasters are expecting the overall pace of economic activity to moderate to a more sustainable pace in DATE as housing markets gradually cool and the delayed effects of higher interest rates and energy prices temper domestic demand. However, with economic activity abroad expanding at a solid pace, export sales should provide some support for domestic production. On balance, the outlook for business investment should remain quite favorable even as the pace of overall activity moderates. Against a backdrop of sustained growth in sales, businesses should be well positioned to undertake potentially profitable projects. They have enjoyed robust earnings for DATE, and their balance sheets are strong. The reports on DATE earnings have been quite positive, and available measures of credit quality, such as credit ratings and loan defaults, show few signs of stress. Financing costs have moved up since DATE, but the Federal Reserve's most recent survey of bank lending practices, which was conducted in DATE, indicates that domestic banks are noticing increases in requests for business loans. They also indicated an increased willingness to supply business loans in an environment of brisk competition from other lenders, a liquid secondary market for business loans, and an increased tolerance for risk. In that regard, research conducted by Federal Reserve economists notes that more banks are offering loans to businesses in markets where the banks do not have branch offices; the research suggests that new technology has spurred competition for some types of small business lending in DATE. More broadly, businesses currently have access to plentiful debt and equity financing from a variety of sources in addition to banks. The challenge that community development practitioners face in working with businesses looking for new investment opportunities is to demonstrate through careful analysis that promising inner-city neighborhoods can be good investments. That the current overall conditions for business investment are positive is thus good news for the work of Social Compact and its partners. The importance of data to investment decisions Community development has come a long way since I first began following it as a young congressional staffer DATE. Whereas government programs once funded the bulk of inner-city development, public-private partnerships now dominate. In many places, community-based organizations have been able to \"jump start\" markets by facilitating private investment. The focus of neighborhood revitalization has shifted increasingly toward market-based approaches. In that regard, organizations that seek to promote neighborhood revitalization must focus on what makes their projects competitive. Social Compact is perhaps best known for its focus on one important input into the investment process - information. Timely and accurate information is what project planners need to bring entrepreneurs, investors, and lenders together to objectively assess the proposed undertaking. Having been a banker, I know very well how much more efficient the process can be when decisionmakers are presented with a clear assessment of the projected returns and a balanced analysis of risk. Another related feature of market-based investment decisions is the importance of built-in measures of accountability. Hard data on results are important in establishing the credibility of projects. With data, and results, such investments can also serve as catalysts for additional private investment in underserved areas. A number of methods have been derived for evaluating the effectiveness of community development projects. The one with which I am most familiar, through my work on the board of NeighborWorks America, is the Success Measures Data System. This system uses more than forty indicators and a variety of data-collection tools - including surveys, interviews, and focus groups - to quantify the effects of housing, economic development, and community building programs at the personal, organizational, and community levels. This array of tools allows NeighborWorks to measure success not just quantitatively but qualitatively, looking beyond the numbers to detect sustainable positive change. The underlying philosophy is that a community development initiative cannot be judged successful just because it puts a family in a home; rather, it must be able to say that, by doing so, it has improved the community, the family's quality of life, and the family's economic potential. These data are also useful to corporate partners insofar as they demonstrate business performance against internal goals and commitment to the community. Businesses recognize that demonstrable success enhances their reputation, increases brand recognition, and improves their ability to compete successfully for future partnership opportunities. Thus, being able to determine the return on a business' investment in a community development initiative in both quantitative and qualitative terms is the next logical step in attracting further private investment. But the social and economic needs of our inner-city neighborhoods extend beyond business investment. Effective partnerships with local officials and community leaders are another key element of the revitalization process. At the state and local levels, public officials contribute to the attractiveness of investment conditions by maintaining sound fiscal policies. These policies allow local officials to take the lead from Social Compact and begin to market local neighborhoods using the analysis that demonstrates the buying-power residing within these more challenging neighborhoods. Their willingness to address other neighborhood needs, such as housing, infrastructure, education, health care, and other social supports will also be important to investors. In general, when community development is a cooperative effort, it can lead to more sustainable outcomes along both economic and social dimensions. While the return on investment can be a sufficient gauge of their economic success, success in broader terms can be viewed by assessing the commitment of all segments of the community to the goal of revitalization. Moreover, the benefits of such cooperative actions are not always readily measurable in dollars and cents. Greater opportunities in local neighborhoods evidence themselves through better schools and stronger ties forged within the local community. The importance of vision So far, my remarks have focused on the tangible aspects of planning and investment. But I do not want to leave out a critical element that is perhaps impossible to measure but underlies each of your Washington Post undertakings. That element is vision. The has reported that when Joe Horning walked through this theater DATE, he was surrounded by broken windows, rotted floor boards, and leaks in the roof. That's what he saw. But what he envisioned was quite different. He envisioned a beautifully restored theater that would not only serve the community but, more important, also serve as a symbol that Columbia Heights could be revitalized. Indeed, in DATE, that vision has been realized, with Columbia Heights DATE a vibrant and viable neighborhood. As in similar neighborhoods in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States, there is much to celebrate in the results of community investments. The increase in street traffic and economic activity makes the neighborhood a livelier and safer place. Property values are rising, and that allows homeowners here to experience the wealth-building power of homeownership that their peers in more-affluent areas have experienced for DATE. It also enables them to invest in the rehabilitation of their homes. This additional investment improves the look and feel of the entire neighborhood. Of course, the higher home prices and rents that result from the increased desirability of this neighborhood also limit the availability of affordable housing. These pressures on the market are being felt here in the Washington metropolitan area as well as in other expanding real estate markets. Washington Post The question of gentrification in Columbia Heights was interestingly portrayed in DATE through the eyes of a pair of DATE girls who have grown up in this neighborhood. The girls entered a citywide essay contest on gentrification, a word that they had not previously known, and observed very keenly the effects of the development going on around them. They noted their increased feeling of safety as they walked to and from school thanks to the rehabilitation of previously vacant rowhouses and the exciting new diversity of individuals living in their neighborhoods. But they also missed the friends whose families were forced to move out of the neighborhood when it became too expensive to stay. They were saddened by the loss of some of the smaller shops that will be replaced by larger retailers. In the end, the girls concluded that gentrification is a complicated issue, and its results are \"not always bad and not always good.\" I would have to agree that gentrification is complicated and requires thorough thought and planning as neighborhood revitalization strategies are developed. Many strategies are being developed at the local level to address the increasing need for affordable housing; these strategies include housing trust funds, private activity bonds, and community land trusts, to name just a few. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is currently studying patterns of home price changes and gentrification in neighborhoods here in Washington, D.C. The work is intended to assist city governments, community development corporations, and funders in anticipating and mitigating the effects of gentrification on lower-income residents. As difficult as the challenges seem, I am confident that if policymakers, researchers, and public and private community development practitioners continue to work together, they will be able to balance new investments with strategies to encourage affordable housing options for sustainable and equitable community development. In the meantime, my colleagues at the Board of Governors and I are committed to sustaining a noninflationary economic expansion and a healthy financial system, which should create a solid foundation for the development of new business opportunities. Of course, although a strong economy and vibrant capital markets are necessary to establish a solid market-based foundation for economic development, they are not sufficient. Successful community development projects require vision, commitment, tough choices, and hard work. Indeed, these are the qualities that each of the projects honored here TIME share. I am pleased to be able to give my personal congratulations to TIME's honorees and to Social Compact for leading the way in the effort to uncover the market potential of inner-city neighborhoods through innovation, risk taking, and the sharing of results.",

                  "Mark W Olson: Community development and the bigger picture Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Social Compact Visionary Awards, Washington, DC, DATE.    I appreciate the opportunity to join you TIME to recognize the successes of an impressive list of community revitalization projects. Having observed the revitalization of Washington, D.C., over a number of DATE, I am particularly pleased to be here at the Tivoli Theatre and see first-hand the work that has been done to restore this historic theater and bring new activity and investment to the Columbia Heights neighborhood. As I look around, it is hard to believe that such an architectural gem sat vacant for DATE. The restoration of the Tivoli honors the past while helping serve the residential, commercial, retail, and cultural needs of Columbia Heights residents. It is a fine example of the transformative power of investments in older, urban neighborhoods. Projects such as this would not be possible without the strategic vision and commitment of community, business, and government leaders. It is that vision we are here to celebrate TIME. I would like to begin by offering a review of the overall economic climate DATE and the prospects for business investment generally. Then, to borrow a phrase from Social Compact, I will \"drill down\" to highlight a number of the elements that I believe are important in making sound investment decisions, particularly in underserved areas of our inner cities. Finally, I will offer a few other observations about the state of the community development industry as I see it. Macroeconomic conditions The recent news on the U.S. economy has been, on the whole, quite positive. Adjusted for inflation, gross domestic product increased at a brisk rate in DATE. Gains in consumer spending and business investment were particularly strong. To be sure, most forecasters are expecting the overall pace of economic activity to moderate to a more sustainable pace in DATE as housing markets gradually cool and the delayed effects of higher interest rates and energy prices temper domestic demand. However, with economic activity abroad expanding at a solid pace, export sales should provide some support for domestic production. On balance, the outlook for business investment should remain quite favorable even as the pace of overall activity moderates. Against a backdrop of sustained growth in sales, businesses should be well positioned to undertake potentially profitable projects. They have enjoyed robust earnings for DATE, and their balance sheets are strong. The reports on DATE earnings have been quite positive, and available measures of credit quality, such as credit ratings and loan defaults, show few signs of stress. Financing costs have moved up since DATE, but the Federal Reserve's most recent survey of bank lending practices, which was conducted in DATE, indicates that domestic banks are noticing increases in requests for business loans. They also indicated an increased willingness to supply business loans in an environment of brisk competition from other lenders, a liquid secondary market for business loans, and an increased tolerance for risk. In that regard, research conducted by Federal Reserve economists notes that more banks are offering loans to businesses in markets where the banks do not have branch offices; the research suggests that new technology has spurred competition for some types of small business lending in DATE. More broadly, businesses currently have access to plentiful debt and equity financing from a variety of sources in addition to banks. The challenge that community development practitioners face in working with businesses looking for new investment opportunities is to demonstrate through careful analysis that promising inner-city neighborhoods can be good investments. That the current overall conditions for business investment are positive is thus good news for the work of Social Compact and its partners. The Importance of data to investment decisions Community development has come a long way since I first began following it as a young congressional staffer DATE. Whereas government programs once funded the bulk of inner-city development, public-private partnerships now dominate. In many places, community-based organizations have been able to \"jump start\" markets by facilitating private investment. The focus of neighborhood revitalization has shifted increasingly toward market-based approaches. In that regard, organizations that seek to promote neighborhood revitalization must focus on what makes their projects competitive. Social Compact is perhaps best known for its focus on one important input into the investment process--information. Timely and accurate information is what project planners need to bring entrepreneurs, investors, and lenders together to objectively assess the proposed undertaking. Having been a banker, I know very well how much more efficient the process can be when decisionmakers are presented with a clear assessment of the projected returns and a balanced analysis of risk. Another related feature of market-based investment decisions is the importance of built-in measures of accountability. Hard data on results are important in establishing the credibility of projects. With data, and results, such investments can also serve as catalysts for additional private investment in underserved areas. A number of methods have been derived for evaluating the effectiveness of community development projects. The one with which I am most familiar, through my work on the board of NeighborWorks America, is the Success Measures Data System. This system uses more than forty indicators and a variety of data-collection tools--including surveys, interviews, and focus groups--to quantify the effects of housing, economic development, and community building programs at the personal, organizational, and community levels. This array of tools allows NeighborWorks to measure success not just quantitatively but qualitatively, looking beyond the numbers to detect sustainable positive change. The underlying philosophy is that a community development initiative cannot be judged successful just because it puts a family in a home; rather, it must be able to say that, by doing so, it has improved the community, the family's quality of life, and the family's economic potential. These data are also useful to corporate partners insofar as they demonstrate business performance against internal goals and commitment to the community. Businesses recognize that demonstrable success enhances their reputation, increases brand recognition, and improves their ability to compete successfully for future partnership opportunities. Thus, being able to determine the return on a business' investment in a community development initiative in both quantitative and qualitative terms is the next logical step in attracting further private investment. But the social and economic needs of our inner-city neighborhoods extend beyond business investment. Effective partnerships with local officials and community leaders are another key element of the revitalization process. At the state and local levels, public officials contribute to the attractiveness of investment conditions by maintaining sound fiscal policies. These policies allow local officials to take the lead from Social Compact and begin to market local neighborhoods using the analysis that demonstrates the buying-power residing within these more challenging neighborhoods. Their willingness to address other neighborhood needs, such as housing, infrastructure, education, health care, and other social supports will also be important to investors. In general, when community development is a cooperative effort, it can lead to more sustainable outcomes along both economic and social dimensions. While the return on investment can be a sufficient gauge of their economic success, success in broader terms can be viewed by assessing the commitment of all segments of the community to the goal of revitalization. Moreover, the benefits of such cooperative actions are not always readily measurable in dollars and cents. Greater opportunities in local neighborhoods evidence themselves through better schools and stronger ties forged within the local community. The importance of vision So far, my remarks have focused on the tangible aspects of planning and investment. But I do not want to leave out a critical element that is perhaps impossible to measure but underlies each of your Washington Post undertakings. That element is vision. The has reported that when Joe Horning walked through this theater DATE, he was surrounded by broken windows, rotted floor boards, and leaks in the roof. That's what he saw. But what he envisioned was quite different. He envisioned a beautifully restored theater that would not only serve the community but, more important, also serve as a symbol that Columbia Heights could be revitalized. Indeed, in DATE, that vision has been realized, with Columbia Heights DATE a vibrant and viable neighborhood. As in similar neighborhoods in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States, there is much to celebrate in the results of community investments. The increase in street traffic and economic activity makes the neighborhood a livelier and safer place. Property values are rising, and that allows homeowners here to experience the wealth-building power of homeownership that their peers in more-affluent areas have experienced for DATE. It also enables them to invest in the rehabilitation of their homes. This additional investment improves the look and feel of the entire neighborhood. Of course, the higher home prices and rents that result from the increased desirability of this neighborhood also limit the availability of affordable housing. These pressures on the market are being felt here in the Washington metropolitan area as well as in other expanding real estate markets. Washington Post The question of gentrification in Columbia Heights was interestingly portrayed in DATE through the eyes of a pair of DATE girls who have grown up in this neighborhood. The girls entered a citywide essay contest on gentrification, a word that they had not previously known, and observed very keenly the effects of the development going on around them. They noted their increased feeling of safety as they walked to and from school thanks to the rehabilitation of previously vacant rowhouses and the exciting new diversity of individuals living in their neighborhoods. But they also missed the friends whose families were forced to move out of the neighborhood when it became too expensive to stay. They were saddened by the loss of some of the smaller shops that will be replaced by larger retailers. In the end, the girls concluded that gentrification is a complicated issue, and its results are \"not always bad and not always good.\" I would have to agree that gentrification is complicated and requires thorough thought and planning as neighborhood revitalization strategies are developed. Many strategies are being developed at the local level to address the increasing need for affordable housing; these strategies include housing trust funds, private activity bonds, and community land trusts, to name just a few. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is currently studying patterns of home price changes and gentrification in neighborhoods here in Washington, D.C. The work is intended to assist city governments, community development corporations, and funders in anticipating and mitigating the effects of gentrification on lower-income residents. As difficult as the challenges seem, I am confident that if policymakers, researchers, and public and private community development practitioners continue to work together, they will be able to balance new investments with strategies to encourage affordable housing options for sustainable and equitable community development. In the meantime, my colleagues at the Board of Governors and I are committed to sustaining a noninflationary economic expansion and a healthy financial system, which should create a solid foundation for the development of new business opportunities. Of course, although a strong economy and vibrant capital markets are necessary to establish a solid market-based foundation for economic development, they are not sufficient. Successful community development projects require vision, commitment, tough choices, and hard work. Indeed, these are the qualities that each of the projects honored here TIME share. I am pleased to be able to give my personal congratulations to TIME's honorees and to Social Compact for leading the way in the effort to uncover the market potential of inner-city neighborhoods through innovation, risk taking, and the sharing of results.",

                  "Mark W Olson: Revisiting traditional paths to ownership Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Community Development Policy Summit: Exploring the Benefits and Challenges of an Ownership Society, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio, DATE.    I'm pleased to be here DATE to discuss the benefits and challenges of the ownership society. Meetings such as this policy summit are extremely useful forums for exchanging ideas and working toward common goals. And, the goals of those of us involved in community development have not changed over DATE. We all want to create healthy, sustainable local economies that provide good jobs, decent housing, and educational opportunities for everyone. At the core of all community development activity is the understanding that individual ownership is one of the most important components of economic and social success, whether in the form of the purchase of a home or an investment in education or a small business. Immigrants instinctively understand that America is an ownership society and, in fact, come here in search of the ownership opportunities that increase the well-being of family members both here and at home. Immigrant communities often create their own economies, establishing the relationships necessary to support one another in finding work, starting small businesses, pursuing education, and purchasing homes. This model has worked for generations of newcomers to the United States. It exemplifies how each group finds its own formula for success based on its skills, culture, and community norms. For DATE, community development efforts were stymied by federal policies that provided one-size-fits-all programs - most of which focused on housing - to communities with very different needs. Over DATE we have learned from our missteps. We now understand that effective community development involves a comprehensive approach focused not only on providing housing, but also on creating programs that increase residents' capacities to make economic contributions to the community. Such programs would support entrepreneurs, provide job training, and facilitate services such as transportation and child care. Federal policies are now designed to recognize the importance of local participation in formulating neighborhood development strategies. Successful strategies take into account the unique attributes of each neighborhood, including the skills of its labor force, existing businesses, economic synergies, and the culture and norms of the community. As federal policy has evolved, its role has shifted from being the sole source of funding through direct appropriation to providing tax incentives and credit enhancements that encourage private investment by offsetting risk. The federal government also plays an important role in creating incentives for private investment, encouraging innovation, and protecting consumers. Federal policy, when properly implemented, can smooth the path to ownership by ensuring that markets operate efficiently. In my remarks, I will discuss two of the most traditional and reliable paths to ownership in our society: homeownership and entrepreneurial pursuits. I will offer my views on why each is critical to the establishment of an ownership society and how changes in federal regulation and policy over time have kept these paths to ownership open to minorities and lower-income individuals. Homeownership Owning a home is one of the most tried-and-true paths to wealth accumulation in our economy. The purchase of a home can be a transforming experience for individuals and families. However, it takes more than a down payment to put people on the path that leads to ownership. Borrowers must be able to sustain their loans over the long term. Part of sustaining a loan is picking the right loan. Over DATE, there has been an explosion of new and novel mortgage products, including mortgages that allow homeowners to skip mortgage payments (which results in increasing the size of their mortgage balance) and mortgages that allow homeowners to pay only the interest on a loan, and not the principal, for a preset period at the beginning of the life of their mortgage loan. Many of these products can be useful financial tools for homebuyers and, indeed, may have helped make homeownership more accessible for some households. But to the extent that these new mortgage products promote homebuying decisions that are premised on unrealistic rates of home appreciation, they raise concerns. Some borrowers may not be able to sustain such a loan over a long time horizon if the pace of home price growth moderates. In particular, when the payments on these novel mortgages adjust upward, the homebuyer may not be able to refinance such mortgages unless the home has increased in value. Homebuyers need to understand these risks and thus financial education, as well as a down payment, is a key ingredient for creating solid footing on the path to homeownership. Federal tax policy has long promoted homeownership by offering homeowners the mortgage interest deduction. Studies have shown that the benefits of homeownership are worth the investment. Homeowners are stakeholders in their communities. They become involved citizens and create the quality of life and character that define a neighborhood.NUM Because of these benefits, federal policy in DATE has focused on increasing the homeownership rate among segments of society, such as minorities and low-income individuals, where homeownership had previously been low. In DATE, Congress passed two laws that, together, changed market dynamics for home mortgage lenders and expanded access to home loans for minorities and lower-income individuals. These laws, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) have increased access to homeownership by making the mortgage market more transparent. Congress enacted HMDA under two assumptions. One was that the mortgage market works more efficiently when more information about it is publicly available. Indeed, the data have been used to identify credit demand in underserved areas with unmet credit needs that might otherwise have been overlooked. The analysis and conclusions drawn from the data have also encouraged the establishment of partnerships between lenders and community organizations to meet credit needs. The second, perhaps more familiar assumption upon which HMDA is based is that regulators need data in order to improve compliance and enforcement of fair lending and consumer protection laws. Accordingly, HMDA data are the first reference points for fair lending examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators. The data help identify potential fair lending issues in the institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve and other supervisory agencies. The recent amendments of Regulation C, HMDA's implementing regulation, build on the theme that transparency breeds efficiency in markets. The amendments require public disclosure of price information in the form of spreads between the annual percentage rate on a loan and the rate on Treasury securities of comparable maturity. This rule is designed to ensure that the data continues to provide a means for improving market efficiency, as well as for monitoring legal compliance with fair lending laws. The new data offer the public and the supervisory agencies charged with enforcing the fair lending laws a better screening tool than what was previously available. Thus, examination resources can be deployed more strategically because the data will allow the agencies to determine, in advance, which lenders and loan products may require more scrutiny. But, more important, the new data will ensure that as the marketplace develops and changes, interested parties will have the information needed to ensure comprehensive fair lending reviews. In addition to statutes that require the collection of public data on mortgage lending, Congress has seen fit to promote market efficiency by enacting a statute, the CRA, that requires federal regulators to evaluate how depository institutions help meet the credit needs of their communities. The statute was amended in DATE to require that those evaluations be made public. The public evaluations of CRA performance, together with the fact that the performance evaluations are considered by regulators in connection with a bank or thrift's application to merge or acquire another institution, have provided incentives for depository institutions to lend in all parts of the neighborhoods they serve, including low- and moderate-income areas. The CRA regulations were amended in DATE to make the evaluation standards more performanceoriented while still taking into account the diversity of business strategies among depository institutions and the variety of economic and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods. As a result, four different evaluation methods were established, and each method considers the context in which the institution operates. In other words, no matter what type of evaluation an institution receives - a streamlined examination for small institutions; a lending, investment, and service test for large institutions; a community development test for wholesale or limited-purpose institutions; or a strategic plan - the characteristics of the institution and the neighborhoods it serves are considered in assigning a performance rating. When CRA rules were revised in DATE, the agencies committed to reviewing them again in DATE to ensure their continued effectiveness. The review process has taken much longer than anticipated, but some progress has been made. The Federal Reserve, together with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is currently reviewing comments on our joint proposal to amend the CRA regulations. These amendments would eliminate data-reporting burdens for institutions under $NUM billion in assets, provide for a new evaluation method for institutions between $NUM million and $NUM billion in assets, and more effectively define community development in rural areas. In proposing these changes to the CRA, the agencies were attempting to balance the compliance burdens being placed on small community banks against community development needs in the geographic areas they serve. The proposal was designed to relieve data-collection burdens on the smaller, large banks while retaining incentives for these institutions to participate in community development activities. The proposed community development test was intended to promote substance over form and give smaller institutions recognition for activities that meet community development needs without dictating whether the activity should be in the form of a loan, an investment, or a service. This flexibility was intended to help institutions in this size category that do not have the resources to engage in a wide range of investment activities, compete more fairly with larger financial institutions. The proposal also attempts to resolve a persistent problem for banks that operate in rural areas where census tracts tend to be middle-income but may contain distinct pockets of lower-income individuals. Although financial institutions receive credit under the CRA for activities that primarily serve low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies, the homogeneous nature of rural census tracts makes crediting such activities difficult. In fact, only NUM percent of rural census tracts are classified as low- or moderate-income tracts, and almost NUM percent of rural counties do not have a single low- or moderate-income tract. The proposal suggested several alternatives for defining what constitutes an underserved rural area and the agencies are still reviewing comments and working to determine which of these alternatives would best define the types of community development activity that should earn CRA credit. Anyone who has been involved in community development recognizes the importance of both HMDA and the CRA. These laws were designed to make the mortgage market more transparent, and they have largely succeeded. Since their enactment, lenders have found lines of business that had not been previously tapped. New partnerships have been established between lenders and community organizations to meet the credit needs that have been identified through the use of HMDA data. In general, the story has been positive for communities and lenders alike. Still, challenges remain. At the same time that regulatory policy encouraged lenders to serve previously underserved individuals, technological advances in the loan-underwriting process allowed lenders to price for risk more efficiently, expanding access to mortgage credit. This expansion has occurred largely in the subprime market and has had both positive and negative effects. DATE, data show record high homeownership rates among low-income and minority borrowers, yet the reports of lending abuses and increased foreclosure rates loom as dark clouds on an otherwise bright horizon. Even though subprime mortgage delinquencies generally are falling, default and foreclosures associated with such mortgages may have adversely affected some neighborhoods. Thus, while it is encouraging that technology has increased the efficiency of the mortgage market, the small yet significant segment of the market in which problems persist cannot be ignored. Foreclosure rates in some areas have increased dramatically since DATE same time frame in which the subprime market experienced its most rapid growth. As we all know, foreclosures do not affect just the borrower who loses his home; they affect the entire community. Multiple foreclosures in one neighborhood will bring down the property value for all homeowners in the neighborhood. In addition, foreclosures cause other negative consequences that will eventually affect even qualified borrowers approved for good loans from responsible lenders. This phenomenon threatens the continued viability of homeownership as a path to the ownership society we seek to establish for lower-income individuals. As a regulator, I believe it is important that we tread lightly in response to market inefficiencies. Predatory lending is a serious problem that needs to be addressed in a way that preserves incentives for responsible subprime lenders so that worthy borrowers with imperfect credit can become homeowners. Constricting the market by pinpointing what might be considered predatory lending and returning to a situation where some borrowers have very limited access to credit is not an ideal solution. We want to encourage, not limit, mortgage lending by responsible lenders in low- and moderate-income markets. In an effort to provide the proper incentives while still protecting consumers in the high-cost mortgage market, in DATE Congress enacted the Home Owners Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). HOEPA helps curb predatory lending by requiring disclosures and limitations on loan terms for home mortgage loans with rates or fees above a certain percentage or amount. After a series of hearings, the Board in DATE extended the scope of the HOEPA regulations. By not making high-cost loans illegal, but rather mandating special consumer protections for such loans, the market can continue to meet the credit needs of higher-risk borrowers. Periodic reviews of regulations such as HOEPA, HMDA, and the CRA are essential to maintain a regulatory framework that is relevant to a dynamic marketplace. I believe that the changes to the HOEPA thresholds, together with the new HMDA pricing data and CRA adjustments - whatever their final form - will continue to provide depository institutions with the incentive to serve their markets as fully as possible and build opportunities for homeownership. Entrepreneurship Federal policy has evolved not only in the area of housing, but also in the area of economic development. I was struck by the remarks of Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs-Jones at the Small Business Development Conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland in May DATE. She described her mission in Congress as creating jobs. Having worked on Capital Hill for DATE, I can tell you that this outlook was not common among elected officials DATE. The understanding that sustainable communities are as dependent on the creation of good jobs as they are on the availability of decent, affordable housing is, I believe, a relatively new construct in our political discourse. Economic development is now commonly understood to be an essential component of successful community development strategies. As the role of large industrial and manufacturing firms in the overall economy declines, small businesses have become critical to creating jobs and economic growth. In fact, the Small Business Administration reports that small businesses employ half of all private-sector employees and, more importantly, have generated NUM to NUM percent of new jobs DATE over DATE. In Ohio, small business proprietors' income in DATE increased by just over NUM percent, from $NUM billion in DATE to $NUM billion in DATE. With numbers like these, it is easy to understand how economic development and small business growth also open the doors to the ownership society. Good jobs with decent wages and benefits provide the basis upon which individuals can begin to save and invest. An essential building block of all economic development is investment, and when private investment does not provide enough capital to stimulate economic growth in a community, public/private partnerships become necessary. Federal policies also help set the stage for lasting economic development by establishing a fair and transparent regulatory system. Federal, state, and local governments promote economic development by providing access to capital and offering various financing options for new and emerging businesses. In addition, financial institutions and communitybased organizations provide capital to firms that qualify for their programs. Federal, state, and local governments also provide valuable technical assistance to small businesses. Providers of advisory services offer business owners a wide array of programs, including business plan development, market strategy design, and management strategies for growth. At the federal level, the SBA cosponsors Small Business Development Centers and offers several other programs that provide valuable resources for small businesses as they develop and grow. The SBA reports that DATE NUM million entrepreneurs received business counseling and technical assistance through one or more of the agency's advisory training programs. The Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is another example of a federal initiative supporting economic development. It was created specifically to foster the establishment and growth of minority businesses by providing funding for a network of business development and resource centers throughout the country that provide minority entrepreneurs with one-on-one assistance. MBDA recognizes that the minority-owned business sector presents a huge growth opportunity, as the minority population is expected to grow from NUM percent of the current population to more than NUM percent by DATE. Nonetheless, MBDA recognizes that while minorities account for NUM percent of the population, minority firms constitute only NUM percent of all businesses and employ only NUM percent of the nation's employees, generating NUM percent of U.S. business revenues. These numbers reflect the fact that minority-owned businesses tend to be in non-asset-based industries, such as service, construction, finance, real estate, and insurance. MBDA believes that minorities continue to face systemic barriers to accessing the capital markets, and the agency is dedicated to removing these impediments. The Federal Reserve also recognizes the importance of information sharing and creating infrastructures that support information flow. Consistent with its mission of promoting economic growth, the Federal Reserve promotes small-business development, particularly in underserved markets, through its Community Affairs Offices. These offices, located in Federal Reserve Districts around the country, provide technical assistance, host workshops and conferences, publish newsletters and reports, and sponsor research to help educate market participants. For example, DATE the Community Affairs Office here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland partnered with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, state and local government, and financial institutions to convene a conference titled \"Big Ideas for Small Businesses.\" Conferences in Ohio and Pennsylvania provided important information on establishing and developing businesses as well as demystifying the lending experience for entrepreneurs. All of these efforts on the part of government agencies - whether federal, state, or local - have the goal of stimulating a self-sustaining process of economic development that will create good jobs and lead to upward mobility. Most successful entrepreneurs see opportunity in the context of their own skills and a particular need in their community or market with which they identify. The exact recipe for success in any one place will not be determined by a government agency, but by the community itself, with the government acting as a supportive partner. Conclusion In closing, I believe the progress that has been made by policymakers in the field of community development over DATE has been remarkable. Community development practitioners have always understood the value of ownership in building sustainable communities; however, public policy designed with flexibility and nuance better achieves the goals of homeownership and smallbusiness ownership. Community development strategies that plant a seed from the community and grow with the help of government and private-sector providers of capital promise to be even more successful over the long term. I look forward to hearing the ideas and suggestions that come out of this conference as we continue to refine policies to meet the challenges ahead.",

                  "Alan Greenspan: Consumer finance Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve System's Fourth Annual Community Affairs Research Conference, Washington, DC, DATE.    It is a pleasure to be here DATE as you conclude your discussions about our dynamic consumer finance market. Our nation's vibrant financial services industry is remarkable in many respects, with myriad providers offering consumers a broad range of transaction and credit options. The industry is central to the functioning of our robust consumer sector. Therefore, it is essential that policymakers, regulators, bankers, researchers, and consumer groups remain fully engaged in monitoring developments in the consumer finance market and continually seek to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the financial services industry, including how well it serves lower-income and underserved consumers. Evolution of the consumer finance market A brief look back at the evolution of the consumer finance market reveals that the financial services industry has long been competitive, innovative, and resilient. Especially in DATE, technological advances have resulted in increased efficiency and scale within the financial services industry. Innovation has brought about a multitude of new products, such as subprime loans and niche credit programs for immigrants. Such developments are representative of the market responses that have driven the financial services industry throughout the history of our country. From colonial times through DATE, most people had quite limited access to credit, and even when credit was available, it was quite expensive. Only the affluent, such as prominent merchants or landowners, were able to obtain personal loans from commercial banks. Working-class people purchased goods with cash or through barter, since banks did not make consumer loans to the general public. However, more-intense industrialization and urbanization during DATE and DATE dramatically changed the market for small consumer loans. Urban wage earners used credit to help them purchase the vast array of durable goods being produced by the new industrial economy, such as automobiles, washing machines, and refrigerators. Naturally, this growth in demand fostered increased competition for consumer credit, and, most important, the development of new intermediaries to supply it. Early in DATE, many new organizations that focused exclusively on the needs of consumers entered the field, and the structure of consumer finance began to change dramatically. Semi-philanthropic groups, called remedial loan societies, were formed to combat the high-rate cash lenders. \"Morris Plan\" banks, which made loans based on savings plans by borrowers, and the first credit unions, accessible exclusively to consumers with a common place of employment, soon followed. By DATE, a wide array of lenders served consumers, including credit unions, small local savings banks, and a nationwide network of state-licensed consumer finance companies. Savings and loans were created, in large part, because commercial banks and other local lenders would not make home mortgage loans. Hundreds of sales finance companies were formed to help manufacturers and retailers provide credit to their customers. Although commercial banks continued to finance merchants, manufacturers, and farmers, they were forced to turn more to consumer lending during the Depression, when their primary business sharply contracted. As these structural changes continued, market demand and growing competition among this wider variety of lenders spawned further innovation. DATE, some hotels began offering credit cards to their regular customers. By DATE, gasoline companies and large retail department stores were also issuing credit cards to their most-valued patrons. These first cards were simply a convenient way for good customers to run a tab with a particular retail business concern, since balances had to be paid in DATE. Later versions, introduced by retail giants Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward, allowed customers to pay their bills in installments, with interest charged on unpaid outstanding balances. This shift to revolving credit, and another innovation - allowing one card to be used at multiple businesses - later generated increasing competition in the card industry. In DATE, commercial banks entered into the credit card business. Home mortgage loans, as we know them DATE, are a fairly recent product born of the failures of the mortgage finance system during the Great Depression. Clearly, radical change was needed. One of the most significant responses to this need was creation of the Federal Housing Administration, which instituted a new type of mortgage loan - the long-term, fixed-rate, self-amortizing mortgage - which became the model that transformed conventional home mortgage lending. A whole industry - thrift institutions - grew up around this one product. The development of a broad-based secondary market for mortgage loans also greatly expanded consumer access to credit. By reducing the risk of making long-term, fixed-rate loans and ensuring liquidity for mortgage lenders, the secondary market helped stimulate widespread competition in the mortgage business. The mortgage-backed security helped create a national and even an international market for mortgages, and market support for a wider variety of home mortgage loan products became commonplace. This led to securitization of a variety of other consumer loan products, such as auto and credit card loans. The current banking structure DATE's fiercely competitive market for consumer credit evolved into its present form slowly but persistently. Along the way, critical structural changes occurred, including entry of, and expansion through, new players. Deregulation of U.S. banking markets has contributed to an approximately NUM percent decline in the number of banking and thrift organizations since DATE, when industry consolidation began. From DATE, the ten largest U.S. banking and thrift organizations, ranked by the total assets of their depository subsidiaries, have increased their share of domestic banking and thrift assets from NUM percent to NUM percent. However, according to most studies, this ongoing consolidation of the U.S. banking system has not reduced overall competitiveness for consumer financial services. When consolidation occurs, it is not uncommon for the merger to result in de novo entry to take advantage of any inefficiencies or transition difficulties of the newly consolidated enterprise. Over DATE, for example, for every five bank mergers that have been approved, two de novo bank charters have been granted. Even in the face of consolidation, competition is fought on the battlefield of the local market, where most households obtain the majority of their banking services. And, it is noteworthy that our measures of local market competition have remained quite stable over DATE. Deregulation and consolidation have also cultivated the expansion of the financial services marketplace, as evidenced by the proliferation of many nonbank entities that provide the credit and transaction services that were once mainly the province of depository institutions. The impact of technology on financial services markets As has every segment of our economy, the financial services sector has been dramatically transformed by technology. Technological advancements have significantly altered the delivery and processing of nearly every consumer financial transaction, from the most basic to the most complex. For example, information processing technology has enabled creditors to achieve significant efficiencies in collecting and assimilating the data necessary to evaluate risk and make corresponding decisions about credit pricing. With these advances in technology, lenders have taken advantage of credit-scoring models and other techniques for efficiently extending credit to a broader spectrum of consumers. The widespread adoption of these models has reduced the costs of evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers, and in competitive markets cost reductions tend to be passed through to borrowers. Where once more-marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit, lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately. These improvements have led to rapid growth in subprime mortgage lending; indeed, DATE subprime mortgages account for roughly NUM percent of the number of all mortgages outstanding, up from just NUM or NUM percent in DATE. For some consumers, however, this reliance on technology has been disconcerting. Credit-scoring models are complex algorithms designed to predict risk. Consumer advocates have raised concerns about the transparency and completeness of the information fit to the algorithm, as well as the rigidity of the types of data used to render credit decisions. Consumer advocates contend that the lack of flexibility in the models can result in the exclusion of some consumers, such as those with little or no credit history, or misrepresentation of the risk that they pose. To address these concerns, some firms have worked to customize credit-scoring systems to include new data and to revalue the weight of the variables employed. Also, new organizations have emerged, developing new systems for collecting alternative data, such as rent payments and other recurring payments that will enable creditors to evaluate creditworthiness of consumers who lack experience with credit. Improved access to credit for consumers, and especially these more-recent developments, has had significant benefits. Unquestionably, innovation and deregulation have vastly expanded credit availability to virtually all income classes. Access to credit has enabled families to purchase homes, deal with emergencies, and obtain goods and services. Home ownership is at a record high, and the number of home mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income and minority families has risen rapidly over DATE. Credit cards and installment loans are also available to the vast majority of households. The more credit availability expands, however, the more important financial education becomes. In this increasingly competitive and complex financial services market, it is essential that consumers acquire the knowledge that will enable them to evaluate products and services from competing providers and determine which best meet their long- and short-term needs. Like all learning, financial education is a process that should begin at DATE and continue throughout life. This cumulative process builds the skills necessary for making critical financial decisions that affect one's ability to attain the assets, such as education, property, and savings, that improve economic well-being. Conclusion As we reflect on the evolution of consumer credit in the United States, we must conclude that innovation and structural change in the financial services industry have been critical in providing expanded access to credit for the vast majority of consumers, including those of limited means. Without these forces, it would have been impossible for lower-income consumers to have the degree of access to credit markets that they now have. This fact underscores the importance of our roles as policymakers, researchers, bankers, and consumer advocates in fostering constructive innovation that is both responsive to market demand and beneficial to consumers.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: Enforcement of financial consumer protection laws Testimony of Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, DATE.    Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the Committee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve Board's ongoing efforts to address and prevent mortgage-related fraud and abusive lending practices in the institutions we supervise. While the expansion of the subprime mortgage market over DATE increased consumers' access to credit, too many homeowners and communities are suffering DATE because of lax underwriting standards and other unfair or deceptive practices that resulted in unsustainable loans. The Federal Reserve is committed to improving consumer protections and promoting responsible lending practices through each of the roles we play as supervisor for safety and soundness and consumer compliance, and as rulewriter. I will discuss the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts as a banking supervisor to ensure that the institutions we supervise are managing their mortgage lending activities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with laws and regulations. I will also discuss the rules and guidance that have been issued over DATE that address many of these issues. In addition to our own examination and enforcement activities, I will talk about our ongoing efforts to coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to hold those who are involved in criminal activities in our supervised institutions accountable. The Federal Reserve's enforcement efforts begin with the examination of its supervised institutions. The Federal Reserve conducts regular examinations of state member banks for both safety and soundness and compliance with consumer protection laws. We also conduct regular inspections of bank holding companies. We examine the mortgage businesses of these institutions, including subprime residential portfolios, as applicable. Institutions with weaknesses are expected to take corrective actions that include improving their risk management and underwriting practices in the future. In those rare instances where the bank is not willing to address the problem, we have and use a full range of powerful enforcement tools to compel corrective action. To ensure that banks with performance deficiencies give appropriate attention to supervisory concerns, we may require them to enter into nonpublic enforcement actions, such as memoranda of understanding. When necessary, we use formal, public enforcement actions, such as Written Agreements, Cease and Desist Orders, or civil money penalties. Mortgage fraud and investigations In DATE, there has been a significant increase in suspected criminal activity with respect to mortgage fraud and other mortgage-related criminal activity. Mortgage fraud occurs in various ways. In many cases mortgage fraud is perpetrated against the financial institution by brokers, appraisers, and other third parties. In other situations fraud is perpetrated by insiders of the institution. As I will discuss further, there are other abusive practices that occur in mortgage lending that harm borrowers and the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) that banking organizations are required to file reveal significant suspected mortgage fraud activity. As recently reported by FinCEN, there is a continuing upward trend of SARs filed by depository institutions involving suspected mortgage loan fraud.NUM From DATE, through DATE, depository institutions filed a total of NUM,NUM SARs reporting suspected mortgage loan fraud. This represents an increase of NUM percent in SARs involving mortgage fraud compared with DATE. During the reporting period, mortgage loan fraud was the third most reported activity in SARs. The top NUM filing institutions of mortgage loan fraud SARs submitted NUM percent of the total NUM,NUM SAR filings. SARs alleging mortgage fraud involve numerous varieties of conduct from largescale multi-million-dollar \"straw borrower\" and property flipping schemes to single incidents of overstated income or assets by individual borrowers. Federal Reserve staff regularly review SARs filed by the financial institutions the Fed supervises. When bank insiders may be involved, we initiate investigations, make referrals to law enforcement, coordinate with law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, and pursue enforcement actions against individuals, including seeking prohibition orders and, in appropriate cases, civil money penalties and restitution. We are pursuing numerous investigations involving insiders relating to possible mortgage-related fraud, both commercial and residential. The Federal Reserve has established a Federal Reserve System examiner group to share information on the detection of fraud and pending investigations. On the local level, Reserve Bank staff also interacts with representatives from law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and other agencies in SAR \"review teams\" to review SARs and coordinate actions. These meetings provide an opportunity to share information about criminal activities, including mortgage fraud, occurring within the district. The Federal Reserve regularly coordinates with law enforcement in a number of ways. Staff participates in DATE interagency meetings led by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Fraud Section and attended by other law enforcement and regulatory agencies. This interagency group, the \"Bank Fraud Working Group,\" discusses and shares information on recent cases, trends, and other issues, including mortgage fraud. Supervision examinations and enforcement In the Federal Reserve's regular safety and soundness examinations of state member banks and bank holding companies, we evaluate risk-management systems, financial condition, and compliance with laws and regulations. In assessing a bank's risk management systems for its mortgage lending activity, examiners evaluate the adequacy of the bank's practices to identify, manage, and control credit risk. This includes the appropriateness of the bank's underwriting standards, credit administration, quality control processes over its own originations and third-party originations, and appraisal and collateral valuation practices. To assist institutions in understanding our supervisory expectations, the Federal Reserve has supplemented its long-standing guidelines on safe and sound real estate lending practices by joining the other federal bank regulatory agencies in issuing additional guidance on mortgage lending practices. Specifically, starting in DATE, the Federal Reserve and the other federal agencies observed that lenders were increasingly originating nontraditional mortgage loans that lacked principal amortization and had the potential for negative amortization. We were also concerned about the growing use of adjustable rate mortgage products with \"teaser\" rates that adjust to a variable rate plus a margin for the remaining term of the loan, in addition to other risky characteristics. These products could result in payment shock to borrowers, and present heightened risks to lenders and borrowers. Moreover, the easing of underwriting standards and the marketing of these products to lower credit quality borrowers, including those purchasing investment properties, held the potential to create significant risks for institutions and for borrowers. To address those concerns and prevent supervised institutions from making unaffordable mortgage loans, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies issued the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products Risks in DATE and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending in DATE. The nontraditional mortgage guidance highlights sound underwriting procedures, portfolio risk management, and consumer protection practices that institutions should follow to prudently originate and manage mortgage loans with payment option and interest-only features. A key aspect of both statements is the recommendation that a lender's analysis of repayment capacity should include an evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay debt. The subprime guidance emphasizes the risks of stated income or reduced documentation loans in the subprime sector. Further, the subprime guidance outlines certain practices that are considered predatory in nature and stipulates that institutions should not engage in these practices regardless of loan features. Also, in DATE the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies issued the Interagency Guidance on Independent Appraisal and Evaluation Functions. This statement reinforces the importance of appraiser independence from the loan origination and credit decision process to ensure that valuations are fairly and appropriately determined. Independence has been a core principle in the Board's appraisal regulation and guidance, which have been in place since DATE. When we examine a bank's real estate lending activities, examiners consider the adequacy of the appraisal function to ensure that it complies with the appraisal regulation and has appropriate risk management practices. A strong appraisal function is essential to combating the potential for mortgage fraud by protecting the collateral valuations from influence by individuals whose intent is to deceive the lender about the condition and value of the collateral. The agencies took steps to further strengthen their guidance in this area by proposing interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines DATE. More recently, the collapse of the global credit market, triggered by the end of housing booms in the United States and other countries and the associated problems in mortgage markets, has led to a deterioration of asset values and credit conditions. As a result, financial institutions have incurred losses that in and of themselves have caused financial institutions to tighten credit underwriting standards to ensure that borrowers have the capacity to repay. Furthermore, sweeping new rules issued by the Board under its authority in the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) will further ensure that mortgage lenders that offer high-cost mortgages have appropriate practices to ensure consumers can repay their loans. Consumer compliance examination and enforcement The Federal Reserve conducts regular examinations of state member banks to evaluate compliance with consumer protection laws, the fair lending laws, and the Community Reinvestment Act. These examinations are conducted by a specially trained cadre of examiners for the approximately NUM banks we supervise. The Board has a long-standing commitment to ensuring that every bank it supervises complies fully with federal financial consumer protection laws, including the fair lending laws. The scope of these examinations includes a review of the bank's compliance with the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), the Community Reinvestment Act, and other federal consumer protection laws. One objective of our consumer compliance examination program is to identify compliance risks at banks before they harm consumers and ensure that state member banks have appropriate controls in place to manage those risks. In conducting a consumer compliance examination at a state member bank, examiners review the commitment and ability of bank management to comply with consumer protection laws as well as the bank's actual compliance with such laws. Examinations follow a risk-focused approach tailored to fit the risk profile of the bank. This approach directs supervisory attention and resources to the products, services, and areas of the bank's operations that pose the greatest risk to consumers. Our examiners prepare a stand-alone consumer compliance examination report bearing a distinct consumer compliance rating for each state member bank we supervise. These confidential reports include an evaluation of the bank's compliance management program, a summary of the fair lending review, and a discussion of violations of consumer laws and regulations. When examiners identify banks with weak and ineffective compliance programs, they document the weaknesses in the examination report and take appropriate supervisory action. Banks with a poor record of compliance are examined more frequently than those with favorable records. When necessary to obtain compliance with consumer protection laws, we can, and do, use our enforcement tools, ranging from nonpublic actions to public Cease and Desist Orders. However, most banks voluntarily address any violations and weaknesses in consumer compliance management programs that our examiners identify so we find public formal actions are not typically necessary. Important tools for examiners and financial institutions are guidance and examination procedures for enforcing the Federal Trade Commission Act's prohibition of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices by State-Chartered Banks issued by the Board and the FDIC in DATE outlines strategies for banks to use to avoid engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, to minimize their own risks and to protect consumers. Among other things, the guidance focuses on loan servicing and managing and monitoring creditors' employees and third-party service providers. The Federal Reserve's consumer compliance supervision authority extends to bank holding companies as well as to state member banks. In DATE, banking organizations have greatly expanded the scope, complexity, and innovation of their business activities. At the same time, compliance requirements associated with these activities have become more complex. To assist financial institutions in addressing these challenges, the Federal Reserve recently issued guidance in DATE clarifying its expectations regarding firm-wide compliance risk management and oversight for both prudential and consumer protection supervision in Complex Risk Management Programs and Oversight at Large Banking Organizations with Complex Compliance Profiles. Further, Federal Reserve consumer compliance examiners routinely participate in the review and assessment of the adequacy of large bank holding company compliance risk management programs. In addition to its own supervisory efforts related to bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve, along with the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and a number of state authorities, recently completed a pilot consumer protection compliance review as part of an interagency project to enhance the supervision of subprime mortgage lenders. Under the pilot project, the agencies coordinated to conduct consumer-protection compliance reviews at selected entities with significant subprime mortgage operations. The reviews included independent state-licensed mortgage lenders, nondepository mortgage lending subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with or serving as agents of these entities. These reviews included targeted evaluations of mortgage underwriting standards, risk management strategies, and compliance with certain consumer protection laws. We are currently assessing the results of the pilot project. The results will guide the Board's decisionmaking as to how it may supervise these entities in the future. Focus on fair lending enforcement Although the Federal Reserve's fair lending enforcement program is not intended to detect mortgage fraud, it is a vital component of the Federal Reserve's efforts to ensure fair access to responsible credit. The Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that every bank it supervises complies fully with the federal fair lending laws, the ECOA and the Fair Housing Act. Every consumer compliance examination includes an evaluation of the bank's fair lending compliance program, as well as an assessment of the bank's fair lending risk across all types of lending, including mortgage lending. Examiners also test the institution's actual lending record for specific types of discrimination, such as pricing discrimination in mortgage lending. A specialized Fair Lending Enforcement Section on the Board's staff works closely with staff at the NUM Reserve Banks across the country to provide guidance on fair lending matters and to ensure that the fair lending laws are enforced rigorously. When examiners find fair lending violations, the Board takes appropriate supervisory action. If we have reason to believe that an institution has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination under the ECOA, the Board, like other federal banking agencies, has a statutory responsibility under the Act to refer the matter to the DOJ, which reviews the referral and decides if further investigation is warranted. A DOJ investigation may result in a public civil enforcement action or settlement. The DOJ may instead return the matter to the Federal Reserve for administrative enforcement. When this occurs, we ensure that the institution takes all appropriate corrective action. If a fair lending violation does not constitute a pattern or practice, we similarly ensure that the bank takes all appropriate corrective action. In carrying out our supervisory responsibilities related to fair lending, Federal Reserve examiners perform many reviews to detect pricing discrimination, redlining, and steering in mortgage lending. These illegal practices can limit fair access to responsible credit, and make it more likely that minorities will fall prey to potentially abusive lending practices. Several of these reviews have resulted in referrals to the DOJ. In DATE, we have referred fifteen matters to the DOJ and four of these matters have involved illegal discrimination in mortgage lending based on race or ethnicity. The Board referred two nationwide mortgage lenders to the DOJ because we determined that Hispanic and African-American borrowers paid more for their loans than comparable non-Hispanic white borrowers. These reviews resulted from a process of targeted reviews for mortgage pricing discrimination that the Federal Reserve initiated when the mortgage pricing data became available under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. We also referred a lender for imposing a restriction on rowhouse lending that resulted in discrimination against African Americans. Finally, we referred a lender for redlining. The lender's marketing strategy was based on negative racial stereotypes and, as a result, excluded a cluster of minority neighborhoods from its lending activity. Rules banning unfair and deceptive practices In addition to our supervisory activities, the Federal Reserve Board in DATE finalized sweeping new rules for home mortgage loans to better protect consumers and facilitate responsible residential mortgage lending. The rules, which amend Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), were adopted under HOEPA, and prohibit unfair, abusive or deceptive home mortgage lending practices and restrict certain other mortgage practices. Importantly, the rules apply to all mortgage lenders, not just depository institutions supervised by the federal banking and thrift regulators. These rules resulted from a series of field hearings conducted by the Board in DATE and DATE and a review of approximately NUM,NUM comment letters representing a broad spectrum of views that were received in response to the Board's proposed rule issued in December DATE. The final rule adds four key protections for a newly defined category of \"higher-priced mortgage loans\" secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The higher-priced thresholds adopted by the Board would cover all, or virtually all, of the subprime market and a portion of the Alt-A market. For loans in this category, these protections will prohibit a lender from making a loan without regard to a borrower's ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the home's value. Second, lenders are prohibited from making \"stated income\" loans and are required in each case to verify the income and assets they rely upon to determine borrowers' repayment ability. Third, the rules restrict the use of prepayment penalties in cases where the borrower could encounter payment shock. Finally, creditors are required to establish an escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for all first-lien mortgage loans. In addition to rules for higher-cost loans, the Board adopted other protections that apply to all mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling, regardless of the cost. The rules prohibit lenders or brokers from coercing, influencing or otherwise encouraging an appraiser to misstate or misrepresent the value of the property. The rules also prohibit, among other things, servicers from engaging in certain unfair practices. I note that the Board is working on another important rulemaking action with other federal agencies and state organizations to implement the registration requirements for residential mortgage loan originators employed by federally supervised institutions, as required by the S.A.F.E. Mortgaging Licensing Act of DATE (SAFE Act). The SAFE Act, when implemented, will provide for increased accountability and tracking of loan originators in a publicly accessible database. Under the SAFE Act, an individual is prohibited from engaging in loan origination without obtaining and maintaining DATE a unique identifier and either a license and registration as a state-licensed loan originator or a registration as a federal loan originator. Prevention and future challenges The Federal Reserve will continue to take actions against institutions that violate consumer protection or fair lending laws, engage in unfair or deceptive practices, or otherwise engage in unsafe or unsound lending practices. We will continue to focus on strong supervision to prevent the occurrence of these practices and violations. In addition to our own examination and enforcement activities, we will continue our efforts to coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to hold those who are involved in our supervised institutions accountable for criminal activities related to mortgage lending. Again, I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss what the Federal Reserve does to address and prevent mortgage-related fraud and abusive lending practices in the institutions we supervise.",

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Protecting homeowners and sustaining home ownership Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the American Securitization Forum NUM Conference, Las Vegas, Nevada, DATE.    The mortgage market has long been a source of strength in the U.S. economy, but it is facing significant challenges, especially in the subprime segment that serves consumers who have shorter or weaker credit records. As of DATE, DATE for which data are available, about NUM percent of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were DATE delinquent, twice the level DATE earlier.NUM More than NUM,NUM foreclosures were started on these mortgages in DATE, up NUM percent from the previous quarter.NUM The significance of the problems with subprime loan performance is evident in the unusually high rate of defaults within DATE of loan origination, known as early payment defaults. In DATE, nearly NUM percent of subprime ARMs originated in DATE were already DATE delinquent, twice the rate of DATE and nearly four times the rate DATE earlier.NUM These problems have many causes, but the role of abusive lending practices is of particular concern. Such practices have led many people into homeownership that they cannot sustain, hurting their families as well as their neighbors and communities. Practices that have hurt consumers have also undermined the confidence of investors and contributed to a virtual shutdown of the subprime market. As a result, it is difficult for many borrowers, especially those with shorter or weaker credit records, to obtain home loans. These events have highlighted the shared interest of mortgage borrowers, their communities, lenders, and investors in protecting borrowers from abusive practices and preserving their choices. Abusive loans that strip their equity or cause them to lose their homes must not be tolerated. Protecting borrowers with responsible underwriting standards also protects the integrity and proper functioning of the mortgage market by increasing investor confidence. In other words, effective consumer protection can reduce uncertainty about the underwriting standards of, and hence, the value of, loans in mortgage-backed securities, thereby helping to revive and strengthen mortgage securities markets. In this way, effective consumer protection produces a complementary benefit for consumers by making more capital available to meet their needs. Similarly, systematic efforts to keep borrowers who may have trouble meeting their loan obligations in their homes on a sustainable basis, by providing more certainty to the market, can have the complementary benefit of ensuring the flow of capital for potential borrowers. With these principles in mind, I will discuss current initiatives to mitigate foreclosures. Then I will spend most of my time discussing the Board's recent initiative in proposing new regulations to prevent abuse, unfairness, and deception in residential mortgage lending. Preventing unnecessary foreclosures About one-and-a-half million adjustable-rate subprime mortgages are scheduled to have their interest rates reset DATE--significantly more than in DATE--and another one-half million in DATE. While many borrowers facing reset will be able to make the higher payment, many will not. As rates reset, it is important that we take steps to protect homeowners, communities, the mortgage market, and the economy from the adverse consequences of unnecessary defaults and foreclosures. Given the high cost of foreclosures to lenders and investors and the disruption and distress that foreclosure can cause to consumers, their families, and their communities, it is in everyone's interest to avoid foreclosures whenever other viable options exist. With large numbers of borrowers facing potential repayment problems, it is in the interest of borrowers and investors alike for the industry to develop prudent loan modification programs and other assistance to help borrowers on a systematic and sustainable basis. The American Securitization Forum (ASF) and the Hope Now Alliance have recognized this interest and have taken leading roles in streamlining the process for refinancing and modifying subprime adjustable-rate mortgages. I have been an active proponent of such streamlined systematic approaches to reduce transactions costs and to help mitigate foreclosure risk, and I strongly encourage market participants to adopt and to implement these fast-track modification proposals as quickly as possible. The efforts by ASF and Hope Now have helped accelerate loan modifications in DATE, according to recently released data. I applaud these efforts but more must be done as the number of households facing resets increases. Challenges remain, for example, with respect to ongoing constraints on servicing capacity to expedite work outs. Servicers must undertake the investment to overcome the capacity challenges and provide transparent and timely measures of the results. A systematic and prudent effort to avoid unnecessary foreclosures has many benefits. Many borrowers with subprime ARMs, for example, have been able to strengthen their credit records by making timely payments so far. It would be very unfortunate if some of these borrowers faced foreclosure when their payments increased merely because servicers lacked the capacity to reach them in time with a sustainable alternative. The solid credit history would be lost and, consequently, financing options would be reduced. Loan-by-loan modifications can help some, but they require substantial time and effort. Where appropriate, an efficient, systematic approach lets servicers reach more of these borrowers and prevent more foreclosures. Furthermore, as noted above, standards for dealing with problem loans may help make more capital available for potential borrowers. By providing more certainty to the mortgage market, clear and consistent standards can help ensure the flow of credit to potential borrowers. While much has been done to prevent avoidable foreclosures, more still needs to be done. For our part, the Federal Reserve has been working with financial institutions and community groups around the country to address the challenges posed by problem loans. For instance, we have been providing community coalitions, counseling agencies, fellow regulators, and others with detailed analyses identifying neighborhoods at high risk of foreclosures. In addition, all twelve of the Federal Reserve Banks have also been working with an array of stakeholders to address these challenges on the local and regional levels. There are also efforts under way on the international level to develop responses to recent financial market turmoil. I represent the Board on the Financial Stability Forum, which has established a working group to diagnose causes of recent events and make recommendations. The Board's proposal I will now focus on the Board's recent proposal for stricter regulations prohibiting abusive and deceptive practices in the mortgage market under authority of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). This proposal is intended to protect consumers and to preserve consumer choice by targeting protections to borrowers who face the most risk. The proposed regulations are designed to protect consumers from excessive layering of risk even as the practices that increase risk may change. We have sought to ensure that these standards are clear for lenders to reduce unintended consequences for consumers. Though clear, the standards are intended to be not overly prescriptive, so as to preserve access to responsible credit while amply protecting consumers. Our proposal is also comprehensive, covering most mortgage loans with certain protections and the entire subprime market with certain more specific regulations. While comprehensive, the proposal would focus protections where the risks are greatest and preserve consumers' access to responsible credit. Our effort to produce robust, clear, and comprehensive rules was based on a rigorous analysis of available qualitative and quantitative data. We have put this proposal out for public comment until DATE and eagerly seek suggestions to be able to craft the best possible final rule. Comprehensive scope Let me say more about the comprehensive scope of this proposal. It would apply stricter regulations to higher-priced mortgage loans, which we have defined broadly. We were particularly interested in ensuring that protections remain strong over time as loan products and lending practices change. Our analysis of the data suggested that the troubles in the mortgage market generally arise not from a single practice in isolation, but instead from the complex ways that risk factors and underwriting practices can affect each other, sometimes called \"risk layering.\" Therefore, we have proposed using a loan's DATE percentage rate, or APR, to determine whether the loan is covered by stricter regulations.NUM Because the APR is closely correlated to risk, the proposed protections would cover loans with higher risks rather than single out particular risk factors or underwriting practices. With the APR thresholds we have proposed, we expect that the new protections would cover the entire subprime mortgage market and the riskier end of the \"near prime\" market, the latter also known as the \"alt-A\" market. Covering part of the alt-A market would anticipate possible actions by lenders to avoid restrictions on subprime loans priced near the threshold. It would also address real risks to consumers in the alt-A segment. This segment grew very rapidly, and it layered risks, such as undocumented income, on top of other risks, such as nontraditional loan structures allowing borrowers to defer paying principal and interest. Our public hearings and our analysis identified problems not just in higher-priced loans, however, but in the broader mortgage market. Thus, our proposal addresses unfair or deceptive practices for the vast majority of mortgage loans secured by a consumer's primary home. Areas targeted this broadly include broker steering, appraisal coercion, unwarranted servicing fees, and deceptive advertising. I'll touch on broker steering toward the end of my remarks. Robust approach to affordability Extending credit that borrowers can afford to repay is a fundamental pillar of responsible lending. Across the whole range of higher-priced mortgage loans, our proposal offers three rules that, working in combination, would help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. First is a requirement that a lender maintain responsible underwriting practices that genuinely assess borrowers' ability to repay. This general requirement would be complemented by a specific requirement to verify borrowers' income and assets. A third rule would require lenders to escrow property taxes and homeowners insurance to help borrowers meet these obligations. This robust approach to affordability would help ensure that the subprime market promotes sustainable homeownership. Just as important, it would also help protect consumers from abuse. When the law requires that DATE payments be affordable, then consumers are less vulnerable to abusive refinancings that strip equity. When the law imposes a responsible underwriting standard on all lenders, then irresponsible actors who would strip borrowers' equity are easier to keep out of the market. Clear lending standards have the further advantages of increasing investor confidence in the mortgage market and helping to revive the flow of credit flow to consumers with shorter or weaker credit records. Assessment of repayment ability Now I want to discuss the major elements of our proposed regulations for higher-priced loans in a little more depth, starting with the requirement to assess repayment ability. The regulations would prohibit a lender from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higherpriced loans based on the value of the borrower's house rather than on the borrower's ability to repay from income, or from assets other than the house. This prohibition is intentionally broad to capture all risks to loan performance and the different ways that these risks can be layered. Moreover, the proposal avoids prescribing quantitative underwriting requirements. For example, the proposal would prohibit a pattern or practice of disregarding the ratio of applicants' income to their debt, but it does not prescribe a maximum ratio because the appropriate number depends heavily on other risk factors, which vary from loan to loan. At the same time, the proposal does offer specifics. For example, it would create a presumption that a lender had violated the regulations if it engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to underwrite at the fully-indexed rate.NUM This presumption is derived from the subprime guidance the agencies issued DATE. It bears emphasis, however, that our proposed regulations would be more robust and comprehensive than the guidance. The regulations would apply to all mortgage lenders, including independent mortgage companies. Guidance, in contrast, does not ensure uniformity of coverage. Moreover, the regulations would be legally enforceable by supervisory and enforcement agencies. Just as important, the regulations, unlike the guidance, would be legally enforceable by consumers. Borrowers who brought timely actions could recover statutory damages for violations, above and beyond any actual damages they suffered. The proposed requirement to assess repayment ability is intended to protect consumers from abusive practices while maintaining their access to responsible credit. We recognize that satisfying both objectives at the same time is a challenge. The proposed rule's potential for consumer actions, coupled with its careful avoidance of prescribing quantitative underwriting thresholds, could raise compliance and litigation risk. In turn, this could raise the cost of credit for higher-risk borrowers or limit the availability of responsible credit. That is why we have proposed prohibiting a \"pattern or practice\" of disregarding repayment ability rather than attaching a risk of legal liability to every individual loan that does not perform. This approach is meant to preserve choices for borrowers with shorter or weaker credit records while protecting them from lenders who have a practice of disregarding repayment ability or are found to exhibit a pattern of unaffordable loans. We anticipate vigorous comment on our proposed approach and have specifically solicited suggestions for its implementation. Income verification When we looked closely at why so many borrowers had mortgages that they struggled to repay so soon after taking out the loan, the prevalence of \"stated-income\" lending was a clear culprit. Substantial anecdotal evidence indicates that failing to verify income invited fraud. Moreover, when we looked at the loan-level data we saw a clear correlation between \"low-doc\" or \"no-doc\" lending and performance problems, particularly early payment defaults. That is why we have proposed to complement a broad requirement to assess repayment ability with a specific requirement to verify the income or assets a lender relies on to make a credit decision. We recognize that stated-income lending may have a proper place when not layered on top of too many other risks. Indeed, stated income lending and \"no/low-doc\" lending are defining features of the alt-A market, which has long served borrowers with good credit scores who seek some underwriting flexibility. We would target the verification requirement to higher-priced loans, including the higher-priced end of the alt-A market, where the risks of stated-income lending could be layered on top of too many other risks. This targeting is intended to maintain consumer access to responsible credit. The proposal identifies standard documents that would be acceptable, such as W-NUM forms. It also allows, however, any third party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of income. This rule is meant to preserve consumer choice by allowing the market to identify credible nontraditional documentation of consumer income--for example, check-cashing receipts. In that regard, the proposal responds to input we gathered through the HOEPA hearing I chaired DATE. Several panelists spoke of the fact that some consumers may have access to only nonstandard documents and others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs, may have some difficulty documenting their income. To help ensure that the proposal preserves access to credit for the full range of consumers, we have sought public comment on this issue. Escrows for taxes and insurance Another part of our proposal for higher-priced loans--a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance--would also help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. Escrowing has become standard practice in the prime market, and the case for making it standard in the subprime market, too, appears compelling. Consumers with shorter or weaker credit histories may be less likely to appreciate the sizable burden that taxes and insurance can add to the cost of homeownership, or more vulnerable to being misled by payment quotes that leave out these amounts. Moreover, when we looked at the data, we saw in the unusually high level of early payment defaults possible evidence that the lack of escrows hurt consumers who did not have experience paying property tax and insurance bills. We have proposed to address the problem with a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance on higher-priced loans, accompanied by a limited allowance for opt-out. We wanted the regulations to prevent irresponsible efforts to encourage borrowers to opt out. So the rule would not permit opt-out at the closing table, but instead would require that DATE pass before a consumer may opt out. In this respect the proposal is intended to preserve consumer choice while protecting consumers from unaffordable mortgage obligations. Prepayment penalties Having discussed the rules that would promote affordability, I want to say a word about our proposed rule on prepayment penalties. These penalties can take a toll on consumers who have riskier loans, and many consumers may not even be aware their loans have a penalty. Accordingly, we have proposed a ban on prepayment penalties in circumstances of a high degree of risk to the consumer, and we are also addressing transparency concerns. The proposed rule would ban prepayment penalties where they are most likely to prevent a consumer from refinancing a loan that has a particularly burdensome payment. Specifically, a penalty would be prohibited where the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds NUM percent, and a penalty would have to expire before a loan's payment could increase. The rule would also ban prepayment penalties where they are more likely to be part of a \"loan flipping\" scheme--specifically, where a lender or its affiliate refinances the lender's own loan. An approach tailored to the degree of risk to the consumer appears to us to be in the best interest of consumers overall. Banning penalties altogether could cause all borrowers, including those who do not prepay, to bear the full cost of investors' prepayment risk. That result would raise questions of fairness, and it could reduce consumer choice. We share concerns, however, that consumers often do not knowingly choose loans with penalties. We are tackling those concerns head-on. Through rigorous consumer testing, we are developing a new disclosure for prepayment penalties to improve consumer awareness and understanding. This should empower consumers to make better informed choices and improve competition. Steering I have so far discussed the elements of our proposal that would seek to ensure that underwriting practices and loan terms on higher-priced loans do not present unwarranted risks to consumers. There is another potential source of risk to consumers that I want to address that is related to \"steering\"--the risk that when they use the services of a mortgage broker, they do not appreciate the extent to which the broker's interests may diverge from the consumer's interests because of \"yield spread premiums.\"NUM The growth of the market for brokerage services has no doubt increased competition in the market for mortgage loans, to the benefit of consumers. Moreover, the yield spread premium, a payment from a lender to a broker based on the loan's interest rate, is sometimes the best way for a consumer to fund the cost of a broker's services. However, when a lender pays a broker for a loan that has a higher rate, that payment can create a conflict of interest between the broker and the consumer. This conflict is problematic if the consumer does not know it exists or assumes, incorrectly, that the broker is obligated to put the consumer's interests first. In such cases, the consumer cannot protect his or her own interests, and competition for loans and for brokerage services does not work effectively. Therefore, we have proposed to prohibit a lender, for both prime and subprime loans, from paying a broker any more than the consumer had expressly agreed that the broker would receive. This agreement must be executed up-front, before the consumer has submitted an application and become invested in closing the deal. The combination of stricter regulation and better disclosure that we are proposing should help reduce a broker's incentive to steer a consumer to a higher rate, empower consumers to shop and negotiate among brokers, and preserve consumers' option to use the services of a broker. Better and earlier information for consumers Lastly, to protect consumers and promote competition, our proposed regulation would prohibit misleading mortgage advertising and require that consumers receive loan-specific disclosures early in the application process, when they can use the information to shop more effectively. We recognize, however, that we face a challenge in ensuring that disclosures for mortgage loans remain effective. We have begun a comprehensive program of rigorous consumer testing of potential improvements to current disclosures. Conclusion There are more elements of our comprehensive proposal that I do not have time DATE to discuss, such as a prohibition against coercing appraisers and restrictions on unwarranted servicing fees. We anticipate vigorous public comment on this proposal, and once we have carefully considered all the input we receive, we will move expeditiously to a final rule. As I noted at the outset, effective consumer protection can help to restore confidence in the mortgage markets and help to preserve the flow of capital to consumers who wish to purchase a home. It is not too early to emphasize that the effectiveness of the final rule will depend critically on effective enforcement. The Federal Reserve will do its part to ensure compliance among the institutions it supervises. We also have been instrumental in launching a pilot project with other federal and state agencies to conduct consumer compliance reviews of non-depository lenders and other industry participants. I am sure we will be aided in these efforts by a new system for registering and tracking mortgage brokers recently launched by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. While we work to build effective consumer protections and enforcement regimes for future consumers, we will also continue our efforts, and encourage the initiatives many others are undertaking, to limit unnecessary foreclosures for consumers who are hurting now.",

The mortgage market has long been a source of strength in the U.S. economy, but it is facing significant challenges, especially in the subprime segment that serves consumers who have shorter or weaker credit records. As of DATE, DATE for which data are available, about NUM percent of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were DATE delinquent, twice the level DATE earlier.NUM Roughly NUM,NUM foreclosures were started on these mortgages in DATE, up NUM percent from the previous quarter.NUM The significance of the problems with subprime loan performance is evident in the unusually high rate of defaults within DATE of loan origination, known as early payment defaults. In DATE, nearly NUM percent of subprime ARMs originated in DATE were already DATE delinquent, twice the rate of DATE and nearly four times the rate DATE earlier.NUM These problems have many causes, but the role of abusive lending practices is of particular concern. Such practices have led many people into homeownership that they cannot sustain, and have had adverse effects on their neighbors and communities as defaults and foreclosures can lead to declines in the values of surrounding properties. Practices that have hurt consumers have also undermined the confidence of investors and contributed to a virtual shutdown of the subprime market with consequences for other segments of the mortgage market. As a result, it is difficult for many borrowers, especially in the subprime space, to obtain home loans. The implications of diminished access to mortgage credit are of particular concern to the audience DATE, given that the subprime market was the source of home purchase loans extended to many in the Hispanic community. These events have highlighted the shared interest of mortgage borrowers, their communities, lenders, and investors in protecting borrowers from abusive practices and preserving their choices. Abusive loans that strip their equity or cause them to lose their homes must not be tolerated. Protecting borrowers with responsible underwriting standards also protects the integrity and proper functioning of the mortgage market by increasing investor confidence Effective consumer protection produces a complementary benefit for consumers by making more capital available to meet their needs. Similarly, systematic efforts to keep borrowers who may have trouble meeting their loan obligations in their homes on a sustainable basis, by providing more certainty to the market, can have the complementary benefit of ensuring the flow of capital for potential borrowers. With these principles in mind, I will discuss current initiatives to mitigate foreclosures. Then I will spend most of my time discussing the Board's recent initiative in proposing new regulations that apply to all mortgage lenders, not just federally supervised banks, that are designed to prevent abuse, unfairness, and deception in residential mortgage lending. The expansive scope of this proposal is essential to ensure that consumer protections convey across the mortgage market, regardless of whether a borrower receives a loan from a bank, an independent mortgage company, or through a mortgage broker. Preventing unnecessary foreclosures Given the high cost of foreclosures to lenders and investors and the disruption and distress that foreclosure can cause to consumers, their families, and their communities, it is in everyone's interest to avoid foreclosures whenever other viable options exist. With large numbers of borrowers facing potential repayment problems, it is in the interest of borrowers and investors alike for the industry to develop prudent loan modification programs and other assistance to help borrowers on a systematic and sustainable basis. As you know, there are various initiatives underway to help borrowers struggling with their mortgages. NeighborWorks America and the Homeownership Preservation Foundation offer financial counseling services through the Homeowners HOPE hotline. The Hope Now Alliance, a broad-based coalition of government sponsored enterprises, industry trade associations, counseling agencies, and mortgage servicers, is making efforts to find ways to help borrowers through loan modification plans. The Federal Housing Administration has established the FHASecure plan to provide qualified borrowers who are delinquent because of an interest rate reset and who have some equity in the home the opportunity to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage. I have been an active proponent of such streamlined systematic approaches to reduce transactions costs and to help mitigate foreclosure risk, and I strongly encourage market participants to adopt and to implement these fast-track modification proposals as quickly as possible. I applaud these efforts but also recognize that much more must be done. Challenges remain, for example, with respect to ongoing constraints on servicing capacity to expedite work outs. Servicers must undertake the investment to overcome the capacity challenges and provide transparent and timely measures of the results. The Federal Reserve has been working with financial institutions and community groups around the country to address the challenges posed by problem loans. For instance, we have been providing community coalitions, counseling agencies, fellow regulators, and others with detailed analyses identifying neighborhoods at high risk of foreclosures. By understanding those areas with concentrations of subprime mortgages, delinquencies, and foreclosures, community leaders can better target their scarce resources to borrowers in need of counseling and other interventions that may help forestall foreclosure. Communities are also working to find ways to address the challenges that foreclosed homes can present, such as decreased home values and vacant properties that can deteriorate from neglect. Toward this end, the Federal Reserve has recently engaged in a partnership with NeighborWorks America to help identify strategies to help stabilize neighborhoods. It is essential that organizations with access to at-risk homeowners, particularly those who may have additional challenges, such as language barriers, engage in foreclosure prevention initiatives to help keep families in their homes and stabilize communities. The Federal Reserve has worked to support consumers by providing them with the information they need to understand and shop for banking products, as well as to file a complaint against a bank. Many of these consumer education brochures are available in Spanish. Importantly, we have just launched a Spanish-language version of the Federal Reserve Consumer Help Center to help better meet the needs of Spanish-speaking consumers. We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of consumers contacting us since we launched this centralized call center and website in DATE, and now we have the capability to reach even greater numbers by providing information and assistance to Spanish-speaking consumers at NUM-NUM-NUM The Board's proposal I will now focus on the Board's recent proposal for stricter regulations prohibiting abusive and deceptive practices in the mortgage market under authority of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). This proposal is intended to protect consumers and to preserve consumer choice by targeting protections to borrowers who face the most risk. We have also sought to ensure that these standards are clear for lenders to reduce unintended consequences for consumers. Though clear, the standards are intended to be not overly prescriptive, so as to preserve access to responsible credit while amply protecting consumers. Our proposal is also comprehensive, covering most mortgage loans with certain protections and the entire subprime market with certain more specific regulations. While comprehensive, the proposal would focus protections where the risks are greatest and preserve consumers' access to responsible credit. Our effort to produce robust, clear, and comprehensive rules was based on a rigorous analysis of available qualitative and quantitative data. We have put this proposal out for public comment until DATE and eagerly seek suggestions to be able to craft the best possible final rule. Comprehensive scope Let me say more about the comprehensive scope of this proposal. It would apply stricter regulations to higher-priced mortgage loans, which we have defined broadly, and it covers all types of mortgage lenders, unlike guidance that only applies to federally insured banks. We were particularly interested in ensuring that protections remain strong over time as loan products and lending practices change. Our analysis of the data suggested that the troubles in the mortgage market generally arise not from a single practice in isolation, but instead from the complex ways that risk factors and underwriting practices can affect each other, sometimes called \"risk layering.\" Therefore, we have proposed using a loan's DATE percentage rate, or APR, to determine whether the loan is covered by stricter regulations.NUM Because the APR is closely correlated to risk, the proposed protections would cover loans with higher risks rather than single out particular risk factors or underwriting practices. With the APR thresholds we have proposed, we expect that the new protections would cover the entire subprime mortgage market and the riskier end of the \"near prime\" market, the latter also known as the \"alt-A\" market. Covering part of the alt-A market would anticipate possible actions by lenders to avoid restrictions on subprime loans priced near the threshold. It would also address real risks to consumers in the alt-A segment. This segment grew very rapidly, and it layered risks, such as undocumented income, on top of other risks, such as nontraditional loan structures allowing borrowers to defer paying principal and interest. However, we have heard from commenters who have expressed concern that in the current market environment, the proposed trigger could cover the market too broadly, and we will carefully consider the issues they raise and other possible approaches to achieve our objective. Our public hearings and our analysis identified problems not just in higher-priced loans, but also in the broader mortgage market. Thus, our proposal addresses unfair or deceptive practices for the vast majority of mortgage loans secured by a consumer's primary home. Areas targeted this broadly include broker steering, appraisal coercion, unwarranted servicing fees, and deceptive advertising. I'll touch on broker steering toward the end of my remarks. Robust approach to affordability Extending credit that borrowers can afford to repay is a fundamental pillar of responsible lending. Across the whole range of higher-priced mortgage loans, our proposal offers three rules that, working in combination, would help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. First, is a requirement that a lender maintain responsible underwriting practices that genuinely assess borrowers' ability to repay. This general requirement would be complemented by a specific requirement to verify the income and assets of the borrower that are relied upon in making the loan. A third rule would require lenders to escrow property taxes and homeowners insurance to help borrowers meet these obligations. This robust approach to affordability would help ensure that the subprime market promotes sustainable homeownership. Just as important, it would also help protect consumers from abusive refinancings that strip equity. Clear lending standards have the further advantages of increasing investor confidence in the mortgage market and helping to revive the flow of credit to consumers with shorter or weaker credit records. Assessment of repayment ability Now I want to discuss the major elements of our proposed regulations for higher-priced loans in a little more depth, starting with the requirement to assess repayment ability. The regulations would prohibit a lender from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higherpriced loans based on the value of the borrower's house rather than on the borrower's ability to repay from income, or from assets other than the house. This prohibition is intentionally broad to capture all risks to loan performance and the different ways that these risks can be layered. Moreover, the proposal avoids prescribing quantitative underwriting requirements. For example, the proposal would prohibit a pattern or practice of disregarding the ratio of applicants' income to their debt, but it does not prescribe a maximum ratio because the appropriate number depends heavily on other risk factors, which vary from loan to loan. At the same time, the proposal does offer specifics. For example, it would create a presumption that a lender had violated the regulations if it engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to underwrite at the fully-indexed rate.NUM Our proposed regulations would be more robust and comprehensive than the subprime guidance the agencies issued DATE. The regulations would apply to all mortgage lenders, including independent mortgage companies. Moreover, the regulations would be legally enforceable by supervisory and enforcement agencies. Just as important, the regulations, unlike the guidance, would be legally enforceable by consumers who could recover statutory and actual damages for violations. The proposed requirement to assess repayment ability is intended to protect consumers from abusive practices while maintaining their access to responsible credit. We recognize that satisfying both objectives at the same time is a challenge. The proposed rule's potential for consumer actions, coupled with its careful avoidance of prescribing quantitative underwriting thresholds, could raise compliance and litigation risk. In turn, this could raise the cost of credit for higher-risk borrowers or limit the availability of responsible credit. That is why we have proposed prohibiting a \"pattern or practice\" of disregarding repayment ability rather than attaching a risk of legal liability to every individual loan that does not perform. Some commentators have argued that the pattern or practice requirement creates a higher standard of proof that can make it more difficult and costly for consumers to pursue litigation. We have specifically sought comment on this provision and look forward to perspectives offered by the industry and consumer groups. Income verification When we looked closely at why so many borrowers had mortgages that they struggled to repay so soon after taking out the loan, the prevalence of \"stated-income\" lending was a clear culprit. Substantial anecdotal evidence indicates that failing to verify income invited fraud. Moreover, when we looked at the loan-level data we saw a clear correlation between \"low-doc\" or \"no-doc\" lending and performance problems, particularly early payment defaults. That is why we have proposed to complement a broad requirement to assess repayment ability with a specific requirement to verify the income or assets a lender relies on to make a credit decision. We recognize that stated-income lending may have a proper place when not layered on top of too many other risks. Therefore, we would target the verification requirement to higher-priced loans, including the higher-priced end of the alt-A market, where the risks of stated-income lending could be layered on top of too many other risks. The proposal identifies standard documents that would be acceptable, such as W-NUM forms. It also allows, however, any third party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of income. Some consumers may have access to only nonstandard documents and others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs, may have some difficulty documenting their income. This rule is meant to preserve consumer choice by allowing the market to identify credible nontraditional documentation of consumer income - for example, check-cashing receipts. To help ensure that the proposal preserves access to credit for the full range of consumers, we have sought public comment on this issue. Escrows for taxes and insurance Another part of our proposal for higher-priced loans - a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance - would also help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. Escrowing has become standard practice in the prime market, and the case for making it standard in the subprime market, too, appears compelling. Consumers with shorter or weaker credit histories may be less likely to appreciate the sizable burden that taxes and insurance can add to the cost of homeownership, or more vulnerable to being misled by payment quotes that leave out these amounts. Moreover, when we looked at the data, we saw in the unusually high level of early payment defaults possible evidence that the lack of escrows hurt consumers who did not have experience paying property tax and insurance bills. We have proposed to address the problem with a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance on higher-priced loans, accompanied by a limited allowance for opt-out. We wanted the regulations to prevent irresponsible efforts to encourage borrowers to opt out. So the rule would not permit opt-out at the closing table, but instead would require that DATE pass before a consumer may opt out. The DATE waiting period would also apply if a consumer refinanced into another high-cost loan, reducing the likelihood that consumers would refinance solely to decrease DATE payments by eliminating escrowing of taxes and insurance. In this respect the proposal is intended to preserve consumer choice while protecting consumers from unaffordable mortgage obligations. Prepayment penalties Having discussed the rules that would promote affordability, I want to say a word about our proposed rule on prepayment penalties. These penalties can take a toll on consumers who have riskier loans, and many consumers may not even be aware their loans have a penalty. Accordingly, we have proposed a ban on prepayment penalties in circumstances of a high degree of risk to the consumer, and we are also addressing transparency concerns. The proposed rule would ban prepayment penalties where they are most likely to prevent a consumer from refinancing a loan that has a particularly burdensome payment. Specifically, a penalty would be prohibited where the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds NUM percent, and a penalty would have to expire before a loan's payment could increase. The rule would also ban prepayment penalties where they are more likely to be part of a \"loan flipping\" scheme - specifically, where a lender or its affiliate refinances the lender's own loan. Banning penalties altogether could cause all borrowers, including those who do not prepay, to bear the full cost of investors' prepayment risk, which could raise questions of fairness, and it could reduce consumer choice. We recognize there are differing views on this and look forward to gaining those perspectives through the comment process. Steering I have so far discussed the elements of our proposal that would seek to ensure that underwriting practices and loan terms on higher-priced loans do not present unwarranted risks to consumers. There is another potential source of risk to consumers that I want to address that is related to \"steering\" - the risk that when they use the services of a mortgage broker, they do not appreciate the extent to which the broker's interests may diverge from the consumer's interests because of \"yield spread premiums.\"NUM The growth of the market for brokerage services has no doubt increased competition in the market for mortgage loans, to the benefit of consumers. Moreover, the yield spread premium, a payment from a lender to a broker based on the loan's interest rate, is sometimes the best way for a consumer to fund the cost of a broker's services. However, when a lender pays a broker for a loan that has a higher rate, that payment can create a conflict of interest between the broker and the consumer. This conflict is problematic if the consumer does not know it exists or assumes, incorrectly, that the broker is obligated to put the consumer's interests first. In such cases, the consumer cannot protect his or her own interests, and competition for loans and for brokerage services does not work effectively. Therefore, we have proposed to prohibit a lender, for both prime and subprime loans, from paying a broker any more than the consumer had expressly agreed that the broker would receive. This agreement must be executed up-front, before the consumer has submitted an application and become invested in closing the deal. The combination of stricter regulation and better disclosure that we are proposing should help reduce a broker's incentive to steer a consumer to a higher rate, empower consumers to shop and negotiate among brokers, and preserve consumers' option to use the services of a broker. Better and earlier information for consumers Lastly, to protect consumers and promote competition, our proposed regulation would prohibit misleading mortgage advertising and require that consumers receive loan-specific disclosures early in the application process, when they can use the information to shop more effectively. We recognize, however, that we face a challenge in ensuring that disclosures for mortgage loans remain effective. We have begun a comprehensive program of rigorous consumer testing of potential improvements to current disclosures. Conclusion There are more elements of our comprehensive proposal that I do not have time DATE to discuss, such as a prohibition against coercing appraisers and restrictions on unwarranted servicing fees. We anticipate vigorous public comment on this proposal, and once we have carefully considered all the input we receive, we will move expeditiously to a final rule. As I noted at the outset, effective consumer protection can help to restore confidence in the mortgage markets and help to preserve the flow of capital to consumers who wish to purchase a home. It is not too early to emphasize that the effectiveness of the final rule will depend critically on effective enforcement. The Federal Reserve will do its part to ensure compliance among the institutions it supervises. We also have been instrumental in launching a pilot project with other federal and state agencies to conduct consumer compliance reviews of non-depository lenders and other industry participants. I am sure we will be aided in these efforts by a new system for registering and tracking mortgage brokers recently launched by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. While we work to build effective consumer protections and enforcement regimes for future consumers, we will also continue our efforts, and encourage the initiatives many others are undertaking, to limit unnecessary foreclosures for consumers who are hurting now.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: Envisioning a future for housing finance Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Mortgage Foreclosure Policy Conference, Chicago, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    Good TIME. I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for this opportunity to offer my perspectives on the housing market - a topic of paramount importance to us all. The conference theme suggests that I take you on a retrospective journey about homeownership in the past, bring you into DATE with thoughts about the current challenging conditions, and leave you with insights on the future state of mortgage finance and housing policies. With DATE upon us, I must admit that I find this trip reminiscent of A Christmas Ebenezer Scrooge's journey in Carol. The Ghost of Homeownership Past might, in retrospect, remind us of a seemingly idyllic time in our nation's history, with high and rising homeownership rates, while the Ghost of Homeownership Present would likely describe one of the bleaker periods in our nation's economy. But I hope that the Ghost of Homeownership Yet to Come would be much cheerier than Dickens' spectral visitor and would show us a future with a housing and mortgage finance system that functions efficiently and provides adequate safeguards for consumers, lenders, and investors going forward. I'm afraid I cannot describe for you, as assuredly as Dickens might, just what that future market will look like, but I will share my thoughts on some general principles that, I would argue, we should look for in new market structures or practices that may emerge. Responsible home ownership and housing finance responsible Let me establish from the outset that I believe homeownership has, for DATE, proven to be good business and good public policy. The benefits derived from sustainable homeownership - including robust local investment and household financial stability - bring value to a community. Homeownership has been the principal means for many families to build wealth and financial stability over time, to use this wealth as a further investment in education and entrepreneurship, and to transfer this wealth to future generations. Lenders who engage in safe, sensible underwriting help to ensure that borrowers are matched with loan products that they can repay. In turn, borrowers can use debt to buy a productive asset that they could not otherwise purchase. Although leverage gained a bad name in the recent crisis, responsible and sustainable leverage can normally help more individuals become homeowners sooner. The scarcity of available mortgage lending at present - especially the lack of relatively lowdown-payment products beyond the Veterans Administration (VA) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) market - most hurts modest-income households who lack other assets. This makes it especially difficult for first-time and minority homebuyers to enter the market. Going forward, the challenge will be to encourage responsible, well-underwritten loan products for these segments of the market while banning lending activity that is unfair or deceptive. Homeownership Past Depending on how far back you walk with the Ghost of Homeownership Past, you might reach a seemingly idyllic world where all mortgages were simple contracts made by local institutions lending for their own portfolios to consumers who could make a substantial down payment and had excellent credit. But in that ostensibly happy place, many responsible consumers were excluded from the benefits of homeownership, funds for lending were limited, and lending institutions ultimately found themselves with unmanageable interest rate risk. In DATE and the earlier part of DATE, financial engineering in the secondary market for mortgages led to the development of more flexible products, efficient underwriting systems, and alternatives for new borrowers to enter the market - all good outcomes when done right. Experimentation, technological advances, and data modeling allowed for the development of niche mortgage products that could better meet the needs of particular subgroups of potential borrowers. These tools, when coupled with other risk mitigants, allowed greater numbers of Americans to buy, and stay in, homes they could afford. But not all of this innovation proved to be positive, for either borrowers or investors. The market overheated. Mortgages became increasingly complex and opaque, as did the mortgage-backed securities that were then offered to investors. Risk innovation became risk layering. A speculative mentality took hold among investors and consumers who expected limitless house price appreciation. Borrowers overreached; risk mitigation peeled away as niche products were mass marketed; lenders made and purchased mortgage loans with lax underwriting standards; and investors relied too heavily on what turned out to be faulty ratings of poorly structured securities. All of this contributed to a housing price bubble that, as we are all too aware, eventually burst. In response, the surviving lenders severely curtailed credit availability. Homeownership Present The lingering effects of this recent history continue to be felt in DATE's housing market. We are now seeing high delinquency rates in every category of mortgages. While defaults in DATE and DATE were elevated by poor underwriting practices and the use of inappropriate mortgage products, the current deterioration reflects to a greater degree job losses and lower house prices. In addition, reduced home equity has impaired borrowers' abilities to refinance their mortgages or sell their homes to cope with income loss, unexpected expenses, or adverse life events. Numerous public, private, and nonprofit efforts are underway to keep these delinquencies from becoming a wave of foreclosures. For example, the Federal Reserve's program of purchasing government agency mortgage-backed securities has significantly reduced mortgage rates, which, in combination with the Administration's Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), has enabled millions of families to reduce their mortgage payments DATE. Hundreds of thousands of homeowners are making reduced payments through trial modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). While these numbers are encouraging, the real success will be in the number of foreclosures actually averted through successful permanent modifications. At the Board of Governors in Washington, and at the regional Federal Reserve Banks across the country, we are providing data and bringing together different parties from the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to encourage strategies for refinance, loan modifications, short sales, and other alternatives to preventable foreclosures. The Federal Reserve System also supports local and regional initiatives to address the negative effects that large numbers of foreclosures can have on individual consumers and their surrounding communities. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago is probably one of the finest examples of such efforts. In DATE, NHS of Chicago identified predatory lending as a threat to the neighborhoods it served. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and many others including - I am proud to say - the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, NHS formed the Home Ownership Preservation Initiative (HOPI). As other communities across the country experienced similar problems, this initiative became a model for foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization efforts elsewhere. This is important, tireless work and much remains to be done. With respect to new lending, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for DATE tell the story of a fractured market for housing finance as private mortgage lending came to a standstill and new lending depended heavily on government support. The number of active mortgage companies fell NUM percent from DATE to DATE, in part because the warehouse lines of credit that mortgage companies depended on to fund their loans contracted significantly. In addition, overall demand for housing slowed appreciably. Indeed, the number of mortgage applications in DATE, NUM million, was about half the DATE level and the lowest in DATE. Such a low level of applications suggests that potential borrowers were wary of entering the housing market or feared being turned down for a loan. The DATE HMDA data also show a dramatic increase in loans made by FHA and VA, whose share of total mortgage originations were higher than at any time in the DATE history of HMDA reporting.NUM These government-backed loans have been characterized as the alternative for borrowers with a weaker credit record in the absence of a subprime market. In addition, they are presumably attractive at the moment because they are among the few affordable options for buyers with stronger credit records but only modest savings available for a down payment. In the recent past, such borrowers would have used a so-called \"piggyback\" mortgage - effectively borrowing part of the down payment - or secured private mortgage insurance to compensate for a higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. According to data from the National Association of Realtors, the typical first-time homebuyer over DATE has had a down payment of less than NUM percent of the purchase price of the home.NUM Securing even that much has historically been a barrier to home purchase, especially among lower-income, younger, or minority households.NUM Yet higher LTV loans that help overcome this barrier also pose higher credit risk. Striking the right balance in loan underwriting is critically important but has proven very difficult. The development of more flexible underwriting standards was originally hailed for the potential to help millions of families become homeowners. But at some point, a line was obviously crossed, standards were dangerously lowered, and loans were underwritten without any regard for a borrower's ability to repay. When home prices fell and jobs were lost, borrowers who did not have other assets to tap were left exposed. So the question is: How can the market re-emerge with enough flexibility to allow more families to achieve homeownership in a responsible way, while avoiding the mistakes of the recent past? Achieving credit quality and availability Some would argue that most of the really risky behavior is now out of the market. But, unfortunately, the backlash has restricted a lot of perfectly responsible lending as well. Banks are reluctant to put any but the lowest possible risk loans in their portfolios. And the market for new private mortgage loan securitizations is essentially closed. Thus, borrowers face tight underwriting requirements, even if their own risk profile looks relatively \"safe\" by historical standards. Moreover, even homebuyers with the requisite down payment realize that their home equity is much less liquid than in the past. Once, borrowers could count on cash-out refinancing or home equity lines of credit as a means of cheaply accessing their home equity; these avenues are now much more restricted. A risk-averse renter might prefer to keep his assets readily available rather than lock them up in a house. On balance, even taking into account the excesses of the bubble period, it appears that lenders have now tightened underwriting terms so much that the lack of credit availability is at least partially an impediment to homeownership. As we work to correct the problems of the recent past, we must keep in mind the importance of access to credit. If anything, the recent mortgage meltdown and sharp pullback in lending only demonstrates how critical it is for the economy to have a well-functioning housing finance market. With the old mortgage system in disarray, we are, one hopes, within sight of a new and stronger system. While there are many structural permutations that might characterize the new system, I would suggest we focus on four core principles for evaluating proposals: Adequate consumer protection. First and foremost, any new system must contain adequate protections for consumers. In the aftermath of widespread abuses, consumers need to feel confident that they can satisfactorily negotiate a reasonable mortgage. Transparency. Second, there must be transparency at all levels. Retail products should be as transparent as possible, so that consumers find it easy to understand the terms and risks of their mortgages. Lenders and servicers should also make as much information as is reasonably feasible available to investors. Indeed, adequate information for due diligence is likely a prerequisite to attract capital back to the mortgage market. Simplicity. Third, the new system should encourage simplicity. Retail mortgage contracts ought to be as simple as possible. Too often, the complexity of mortgages has served to confuse borrowers and make it more difficult to make informed decisions. Similarly, the complexity of the securitizations into which mortgages were packaged made analysis difficult for investors. These structures turned out to be especially fragile when stressed with high defaults and subsequent losses. After the crash, with delinquencies rising, investors found modeling the cash flows under alternative scenarios confusing and uncertain. While complexity may prove to be an inevitable byproduct of financial innovation, investors will likely demand much simpler instruments going forward. Properly aligned incentives. Finally, the new system should feature clear roles and properly aligned incentives for all players. Too often in the recent turmoil, we saw examples of misaligned interests and competing objectives. For instance, there is evidence that some loan officers and mortgage brokers may have been as concerned about whether loans were profitable to them personally as they were about whether the borrower could actually repay.NUM Servicers, too, turned out to have interests that were not always aligned with investors, and different tranches of investors themselves had competing interests that they tried to impose onto servicers. Certainly, greater clarity about roles and responsibilities, and the associated compensation of participants in the origination chain, will help all parties understand, and properly align, incentives. Homeownership yet to come Under these guiding principles, what would a new mortgage market look like? Lending practices The Federal Reserve has already taken steps to implement and enforce safeguards to shield consumers from hazards in the market. In DATE, we have created a blanket of new protections for consumers under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, adding layers of defenses for borrowers as they participate in the economy.NUM The new rules, most of which went into effect on DATE, target higher-priced loans, where borrowers are most vulnerable to abuse. Our new rules require that lenders verify borrowers' abilities to repay these \"riskier\" mortgages, ban prepayment penalties if payments may increase in the loan's DATE, require escrows for taxes and insurance, and prohibit a range of misleading advertising practices. Under Truth in Lending we also have recently proposed revised mortgage disclosure forms for all loans. These new forms were developed through consumer testing to ensure that they provide information that is useful and understandable to consumers. These disclosures are designed to focus consumer attention on mortgage features, such as variable rates, that might be appropriate for some consumers, but potentially risky for others. And we have proposed to ban compensation that gives originators incentives to steer borrowers to loans with higher rates or disadvantageous terms. We would encourage comments on these proposals; the public comment period is open until DATE Despite efforts to improve disclosures and ban egregious practices, obtaining a mortgage and purchasing a home is still a significant and complex transaction. Evidence indicates that consumer counseling, whether for pre-purchase or foreclosure prevention, leads to better outcomes for consumers.NUM This is likely to remain true even if we do a better job of providing much-needed financial education. So it would make sense to include strong incentives to obtain counseling and strong support for housing counselors in our toolkit of the future. Secondary market While these important consumer protections will help restore borrower confidence, restoration of investor confidence may not come as easily. Whether the ultimate vehicle is covered bonds, loan securitizations, or some other model, a mechanism for channeling investment funds into housing finance will be critical to meeting the demands of a normally functioning housing market. Restoration of the residential housing finance market will require more than liquidity. At a minimum, it is likely to require access to information, standardized contracts, and simplified structures. In the past, potential investors found it difficult to access loan-level data on the deals they were investing in. At best, market participants had access to underwriting and performance information only after the deal had been issued. Even then, complete information on borrower leverage - such as through \"silent seconds\" or junior liens obtained after the origination of the first - was difficult, or expensive, to come by. Some of the security structures that proliferated late in the credit boom contained features that, whatever their initial purpose have served to obfuscate the relationship between loan performance and security cash flow. Securities also differed markedly in the governing contracts, notably the pooling and servicing agreements, or PSAs. These crucial documents were hundreds of pages long, differed across deals, and the agreements themselves, despite being obsessively detailed, failed to address a scenario of rapidly mounting credit losses. Future securities will benefit from as much standardization as possible across contracts, and the contracts will have to spell out clearly how they can be amended to deal with unforeseeable circumstances. Recognizing that no contract will ever be able to specify rules for all possible contingencies, contracts should specify a governance structure for decisionmaking in extreme circumstances. Servicers Servicers have not always been the most visible part of the mortgage business. Responses to this current crisis, however, including attempts to make large-scale loan modifications, have pointed to the critical role that servicers play through their direct interaction with borrowers. Yet, there have been problems. Many servicers did not have - and some may still not have - adequate systems and personnel in place to deal with the sheer scale of the foreclosure crisis. Servicers are concerned about the competing interest of investors and the threat of litigation for pursuing alternatives to foreclosure. In turn, some investors have questioned servicers' incentives. In the future, servicer contracts will need to provide clear guidance and incentive structures that lead to transparency and certainty in loan modifications and other loss mitigation tools. Performance under such contracts will require servicers to make investments in staffing and information technology infrastructure. And finally, in the future, compensation for servicers likely will need to recognize the different resources required for loss mitigation as opposed to simple payment accounting and forwarding. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac It would be unrealistic to expect the private mortgage market to rebound without defining the ongoing role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have continued to issue large quantities of securities even as private securitization faltered, apparently because investors have continued to believe that the government stands behind them. That experience suggests that, at least under the most stressed conditions, some form of government backstop may be necessary to ensure continued securitization of mortgages. However, restarting the GSEs in their old forms would do nothing but ask for a repeat of recent history. Without getting into specific proposals DATE, I'll simply say that whatever is the ultimate future for Fannie and Freddie, market participants will need to see a clear roadmap for both the individual institutions and the role of government in housing finance before private markets can begin to map a course for themselves. Conclusion DATE I have attempted to outline a framework for a better-functioning mortgage market that protects consumers and provides transparency to lenders, investors, and all market participants. This is the housing finance market we need to create if responsible homeownership is to return as a safe and viable option for the majority of consumers. It is a market that would be attractive and profitable for lenders, servicers, and investors who are prepared to engage in prudent, responsible, and transparent business practices. Lending, when done responsibly, is good for business. Homeownership, when sustainable, is good for consumers. Leverage, when used judiciously, is critical to a functioning market. It would be hard to overestimate the damage that has been done to the housing market in DATE, and especially to the millions of families that are suffering the devastating consequences of foreclosure. It would be equally difficult to overestimate the damage that would be done in the future if we must live with a chronically impaired mortgage market. We absolutely need to change our systems so that they function properly, support the emergence of simpler, more transparent markets, ensure aligned incentives among all parties, and, above all, protect consumers. That, I would hope, is the market of Homeownership Yet to Come.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: Keys to successful neighborhood stabilization Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Community Stabilization Symposium, NeighborWorks Training Institute, National Harbor, Maryland, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    Good morning. I am very pleased to be here to welcome you to the NeighborWorks' Training Institute Symposium on Community Stabilization. The Federal Reserve is co-sponsoring this event as part of a partnership we have with NeighborWorks America (NeighborWorks) to reduce the impact of foreclosures in low- and moderate-income communities. Clearly, much remains to be done to stabilize communities hard-hit by the foreclosure crisis, but we are encouraged by the work of this partnership, now in DATE. We are leveraging the resources of the Federal Reserve, particularly our data resources and our network of regional Reserve Banks across the country, to assist NeighborWorks' activities with respect to training, foreclosure counseling resources, and building the capacity of local community organizations. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke asked me to chair the Board's Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs and to represent the Federal Reserve on the NeighborWorks Board. As a former community banker, I came to my new assignments with an understanding of the role that financial institutions, in partnership with local stakeholders, play in creating healthy sustainable communities. But I wanted to see first-hand how the economic crisis was impacting communities, how NeighborWorks was responding, and how the Reserve Banks were assisting communities under stress and the organizations that serve them. So, Community Affairs staff in the twelve Reserve Bank Districts and the community organizations they work with - including many NeighborWorks Organizations - arranged for me to tour several stressed communities across the country. And I must say, these visits have enriched my understanding of the vital work being done in local communities, and its importance for the nation's economic future. So I thought the best way I could kick off this conference would be to tell you a little bit about what I learned on my visits, particularly as these lessons relate to community stabilization efforts. I know that most of what I say will come as no surprise to those of you who work with these issues every day. But I want to recognize the significant work you do and express my profound appreciation, especially to those who shared their experiences with me as we toured your cities and learned about your work. Regional economic conditions matter The first lesson I learned during my travels is that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for community stabilization. The downturn in housing has affected communities in a variety of ways, depending on the underlying economics of each. Because of these variations, a stabilization strategy that is effective in an industrial city facing high unemployment is unlikely to suit a suburban community where employment has remained relatively stable. Communities with weak underlying economies are characterized by a long trend of population loss, gradual impoverishment, and strained municipal resources. For cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Indianapolis the increase in foreclosures over DATE has exacerbated a pre-existing vacancy problem.NUM The increased rates of foreclosures and the related economic downturn have hastened a cycle of decreasing property values. Declines in state and local property and sales tax revenues result in even more vacant homes and deteriorating neighborhoods. Many community organizations and homeowners have been frustrated by the difficulties of working with mortgage lenders and servicers, and these problems are even more exaggerated in weaker market cities. In the most devastated neighborhoods, some lenders do not even complete the foreclosure process or record the outcome of foreclosure sales because the cost of foreclosing exceeds the value of the property. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these \"toxic titles\" have placed significant numbers of properties in a difficult state of legal limbo.NUM As a result of the high rates of abandonment, many cities such as Flint, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, and Youngstown, Ohio have pursued plans to \"right size\" by demolishing vacant properties and creating land banks. These strategies effectively align housing supply with demand and create open spaces and parkland that promote community health and sustainability. Several community organizations in Detroit, for instance, have joined together to promote an urban farming initiative that not only reclaims abandoned properties but capitalizes on the growing popularity of locally grown food. Detroit's Garden Resource Program provides hundreds of home, school, and community gardens access to resources and information that empower residents to grow, harvest, prepare, and preserve food in their backyards and neighborhoods. In DATE, the program supplied over NUM community gardens, NUM schools, and NUM families with seeds, plants, and training that produced thousands of pounds of food inside the City of Detroit.NUM Even communities with strong underlying economies have not been immune to the destabilizing effects of high foreclosure rates. I visited California's Inland Empire and Los Angeles, as well as areas in Atlanta, that until recently were economically vibrant. Many coastal cities - even those with jobs and growing populations - now are in distress because of high rates of foreclosure. For instance, the Florida cities of Cape Coral, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Sarasota are among those with the highest rates of foreclosure - between NUM and NUM percent. These areas, and others in the West, such as Las Vegas and Phoenix, experienced very high rates of new home construction and speculative investments that resulted in unsustainable price escalation throughout the early part of this decade.NUM Vacant properties are creating a different kind of problem in some California markets. Indeed, as investors sense that home prices have bottomed out, they are approaching servicers with cash offers for the bulk purchase of properties. In fact, community organizations in areas of California complain that investor interest has heated up to the point that qualified first-time homebuyers and local community organizations are being crowded out of the market. Foreclosure rescue scams that have taken up residence in nearly every community appear to be even more prevalent in stronger market areas where retaining title to a home is more economically feasible. One counselor in Los Angeles told me that as many as NUM percent of the homeowners she counseled had been victims of rescue scams. In addition to the economic dynamics of any particular city, it is clear that, even within metropolitan areas, community stabilization issues can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. For example, Cleveland's highest vacancy rates are primarily in its urban core, while in Atlanta, the problem of high foreclosure rates is found not only in the urban core, but also in outer suburban communities that experienced significant growth recently. For cities like Atlanta, strategies addressing high foreclosure rates must take into account wide variations in local capacity across and within metropolitan areas. Newer suburbs have not, for the most part, had time to develop the community resources and technical expertise that exist in urban centers. Another lesson I learned in my travels is about the need to understand community dynamics. In the end, the success of any community stabilization plan depends on the dedication and expertise of local leaders like those of you here DATE. Cleveland's Detroit Shoreway neighborhood, for example, clearly demonstrates that with the right vision, leadership, and planning even a highly distressed community can regain its position as a dynamic and attractive neighborhood by maximizing its natural and cultural assets. Holistic approach is key Foreclosure mitigation activities, by necessity, focus on individual houses and mortgages in an attempt to resolve legal and economic issues between borrowers, servicers, and investors. Nonetheless, after visiting with community organizations and seeing their work first-hand, it is clear to me that the most effective community stabilization approaches look beyond homes and mortgages. Successful community stabilization requires a broader vision of community, one that factors in the many elements that make a neighborhood a desirable place to live. The bottom line is that housing alone is not sufficient to create sustainable and economically resilient communities. I have seen several compelling examples of this kind of multi-faceted approach to community development. Atlanta's development efforts, for example, included the creation of the Center for Working Families. The Center serves people who are seeking employment and are eager to learn new skills that will help them support their families, build wealth, or start a business. The Center also offers its clients individual coaching to help them hurdle the barriers that keep them from securing and maintaining employment by providing transportation assistance, childcare subsidies, and computer literacy training. And, unlike a traditional job training and placement program, the Center's relationship with its clients continues long after they secure employment. Nearby, in the Centennial Place neighborhood, a mixed-income, mixed-use community developed by the Atlanta Housing Authority on the site of one of the nation's first public housing complexes, I found Centennial Place Elementary School. Centennial Place is a math, science, and technology-oriented school that is breaking records as one of the top performing schools in the Atlanta school system. They have steadily improved test scores in reading and math. Students and parents alike are fully engaged in the learning process in this state-of-the-art school. In Dallas, I was introduced to Lone Star Investment Advisors, an organization that invests in low- to moderate- income areas throughout Texas. Lone Star created a private equity fund that invests in Texas companies that are located in, or willing to move to, low-income census tracts. The fund's managers have focused on manufacturing and distribution companies that are valued at $NUM million and up and can create jobs in the state's lower-income communities. Its double bottom-line approach to investments - making a profit while benefitting the community - makes it attractive to bankers with Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) obligations as well as other socially-minded investors. PrimeSource Food Service Equipment is one such business that Lone Star moved from an affluent northern Dallas suburb to South Dallas, where the poverty rate is NUM%. PrimeSource relocated over NUM employees and hired new employees from South Dallas. In Philadelphia, I toured a supermarket that provides for one of the most basic needs in many low-income neighborhoods: fresh food. The Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative is an innovative program that works to increase the number of supermarkets and groceries in underserved communities across Pennsylvania. The initiative is supported by a partnership among The Reinvestment Fund, a non-profit developer, and two community organizations, The Food Trust and the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition.NUM This partnership has stepped in to fill a financing need where infrastructure costs were not met by conventional financial institutions. In addition to improving the neighborhood's access to nutritious food, the supermarket initiative meets several other community needs, including job creation and lower food costs for those with limited incomes. It also provides a focal point for other vital retail needs in the community. Other organizations are dedicated to meeting the healthcare needs of their community. Chicago's Lawndale Christian Health Center is one such organization.NUM The center serves the Lawndale and Garfield communities on the West Side of Chicago by providing quality primary care services without regard to a patient's ability to pay, and in so doing, it works to eliminate the impact of healthcare disparities among the city's residents. The Lawndale Center is known for its holistic approach to healthcare: it offers not only primary medical care, including internal medicine, pediatrics, cardiology, optometry, and dentistry, but also services that support patients' psychological, spiritual, and social health. In DATE alone, the Center accommodated more than NUM,NUM outpatient medical visits, NUM,NUM hospital visits, NUM deliveries, NUM,NUM dental visits, and NUM,NUM optometry visits. The Center also offers programs in leadership development and organizational capacity building for the community, and it employs more than NUM people, many of whom live in the community or were attracted to the community because of the Center. But even more impressive to me is the Center's connection to the community it serves. The Center was founded in DATE when a group of Lawndale residents saw a need in their community and worked to fill it. Ownership of the Center is retained by community members, ensuring that it will continue to meet the needs in its neighborhood. As these examples illustrate, a vibrant community is made up of more than houses. Neighborhoods need the right blend of housing, retail, and community services in order to remain desirable and resilient to economic cycles. Of course, the solution is not that simple. Even a neighborhood with that perfect mix of housing, retail, and services can find itself struggling. In my travels I realized that there is one characteristic shared by the communities that have coped most successfully in the economic downturn: organizational capacity. Organizational capacity As I am sure you are aware, the relationship between organizational capacity and the success of community stabilization efforts cannot be underestimated. I have had the good fortune to observe many communities whose response to the foreclosure crisis was immediate and, ultimately, has been more effective because of the deep roots of organizations in the community and the experience they have developed over DATE. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, where Bruce Gotschall has served as Executive Director since its founding in DATE, is probably one of the finest examples of this kind of organizational capacity. In DATE, NHS of Chicago identified predatory lending as a threat to the neighborhoods it served. In collaboration with the City of Chicago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and many others, NHS formed the first Home Ownership Preservation Initiative (HOPI). This initiative became the model for foreclosure prevention and has been replicated across the country. Because of this experience, NHS was wellprepared to assist Chicagoans in the recent housing market downturn. By contrast, many communities are facing the issues of vacancy, abandonment, and decay for the first time, and these communities need help to grow the human and financial capital required to address neighborhood decline. These capacities do not appear overnight, but they can be developed. As your attendance at this Training Institute demonstrates, there is a strong appetite among community organizations for information, training, and leadership development. And I am encouraged by your dedication. As a NeighborWorks Board member, I am aware that the demand for training has grown dramatically in DATE and I am very impressed by the breadth, depth, and quality of the Training Institute's offerings. In fact, a significant part of the Federal Reserve's partnership with NeighborWorks involves funding the development of courses designed to help community leaders address stabilization challenges, particularly with respect to the acquisition and disposition of real estate. In DATE of the partnership alone, NUM training certificates were awarded in the new community stabilization coursework, with even more community development practitioners attending workshops and events designed to highlight best practices and new programs available to stabilize communities. In addition to training sessions, practitioners can access this information on StableCommunities.org, a website developed by NeighborWorks with the Federal Reserve's support. The role of the Federal Reserve The partnership between the Federal Reserve and NeighborWorks America is just one aspect of the Federal Reserve's effort to stabilize neighborhoods. Community Affairs staff across the Federal Reserve System are providing data analysis and technical assistance to state and local governments trying to address foreclosures in their communities. For example, the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta are collaborating on a series of capacity-building sessions for several communities in Appalachia to improve their ability to leverage federal Neighborhood Stabilization Funds. In addition, we are studying the Neighborhood Stabilization Program and interviewing some NUM program grantees nationwide to learn about the early successes and challenges to this effort to restore health to communities with high foreclosure rates. We continue to engage in a good deal of outreach to stay informed about the challenges facing communities as this crisis evolves. Federal Reserve staff recently attended a series of meetings organized by National People's Action (NPA). These meetings, held in nine cities chosen by NPA, were designed to gather first-hand information about the impact of foreclosures in low-income communities. In each city, Fed staff met with local leaders, toured communities hit by foreclosures, and attended public meetings. In addition to giving us information about foreclosure's impact on various communities, the public meetings have been effective in drawing local press coverage, which hopefully has heightened local attention to the issues faced by residents. The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to identify ways in which our strengths as a research institution, combined with our network of Community Affairs outreach staff, can be leveraged to help communities recover from high numbers of foreclosures and related economic impacts. Conclusion In conclusion, I want to thank you all for your commitment to your communities and for your attendance here DATE. This symposium is designed to provoke and inspire our best thinking - and action - related to neighborhood stabilization. I hope that each of you finds something in DATE's discussion that applies to the underlying economic conditions of your neighborhood, that encourages holistic solutions to the problems your community faces, and that improves your ability to meet the demands placed on you as a leader in your community.",

                  "Edward M Gramlich: The politics of inflation targeting Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Euromoney Inflation Conference, Paris, DATE.    While many policymaking innovations have spread around the world from large nations to small, inflation targeting took a reverse course. It was first adopted in New Zealand in DATE, appeared to be successful, and has now spread to more than twenty nations. The regime is now being urged on the laggard countries that have not yet joined the bandwagon, notably the United States. The question of whether a country should adopt inflation targeting raises several issues. At the theoretical level, inflation targeting is alleged to promote central bank transparency, clarify communication, and establish a central bank commitment to price stability. These advantages are offset by the fact that inflation targeting could lead to rigid or formulaic policies that limit flexibility. Given the impossibility of rewriting history - trying to determine either what an inflation-targeting central bank would have done in response to some economic shock had it been a nontargeter or what a nontargeting central bank would have done had it been a targeter - the theoretical debate has never proved conclusive in deciding for or against inflation targeting. Nor is the empirical evidence conclusive. Econometric studies find that, in countries that have adopted inflation targeting, inflation rates have fallen, spreads between nominal and real interest rates have fallen, other measures of expectations of inflation have fallen, and macroeconomic growth numbers have not worsened and have often improved. From this point of view, inflation targeting looks to have been successful. But inflation rates have also fallen, nominal-real spreads have fallen, inflation expectations have fallen, and macroeconomic growth numbers have improved in at least one significant country that has not adopted inflation targeting, the United States. The general verdict of the many comparison studies seems to be in favor of inflation targeting, but something else, most likely the sheer commitment to price stability, has also appeared to have worked just as well in the United States. For countries that have not yet adopted inflation targeting, a key issue then becomes politics. The countries that have adopted inflation targeting report that the regime has helped to clarify the relationship between the central bank and the government, generally giving the government say over the ultimate objectives of monetary policy but the central bank freedom in how it pursues these objectives. But these are usually parliamentary countries where the governmental authorities have strongly endorsed inflation targeting. There is a large question about what a central bank should do in a congressional system, when its government has not endorsed inflation targeting. That is the issue I will discuss DATE. After reviewing present-day inflation-targeting relationships around the world, I turn my attention to political considerations for the United States. Present inflation-targeting arrangements The first country to adopt inflation targeting, New Zealand, did so with strong support and fairly specific instructions from its legislature. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act of DATE established the basic framework. This act gave the central bank the objective \"of achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices,\" with \"regard for the efficiency and soundness of the financial system.\" The act provided that the government and Reserve Bank jointly determine the specific inflation target and other policy objectives through Policy Target Agreements. The first of these target agreements defined price stability as a range of NUM percent to NUM percent in New Zealand's Consumers Price Index (CPI), set a goal of achieving price stability DATE hence, and gave conditions that could justify going outside the price stability band. Subsequent agreements have modified the target CPI, widened the tolerance band, and introduced other objectives, such as the stability of output growth. These modifications have generally made New Zealand's inflation-targeting regime much more flexible. Governmental involvement was still very important, though somewhat less explicit, for the next three inflation targeters. Chile's adoption of inflation targeting in DATE was preceded by new central bank legislation. Canada, which adopted inflation targeting in DATE, used the vehicle of a joint announcement by the Ministry of Finance and the governor of the Bank of Canada. This announcement, and subsequent joint announcements, established a target range for price stability but left the details, and the responsibility for policy, in the hands of the Bank. In Britain, which adopted inflation targeting in DATE, the chancellor of the Exchequer first announced the inflation goal. The Bank of England did not even have operational independence at the time. Though the Bank later gained independence, the chancellor still sets policy goals for the Bank through periodic remits. In the next wave of inflation targeters, there was less-explicit governmental involvement. In Sweden, which adopted inflation targeting in DATE, the government had previously announced that controlling inflation was an overriding goal for the Riksbank. In Australia, the Reserve Bank governor announced its inflation-targeting regime in a speech, using broad, previously delegated authority. In Norway, the Norges Bank operates under a governmental mandate declaring that the long-term objective of monetary policy is to maintain the domestic and international value of its currency. The European Central Bank (ECB) operates its regime under authority delegated by the Treaty Establishing the European Community, with the primary goal of price stability established by the treaty. Lessons are more diffuse from the last wave of countries to adopt inflation targeting. Brazil's adoption of inflation targeting in DATE was preceded by a presidential decree. Hungary and Poland adopted inflation targeting following parliamentary acts stipulating that price stability was the main objective for the central bank. But in two cases, Mexico and the Czech Republic, the central bank moved to inflation targeting on its own. In the Czech Republic, subsequent legislation enshrined price stability as the main objective of the central bank, but not in Mexico. Although these regimes differ from one another, there is at least some governmental involvement in all but the Mexican case. The level of involvement ranges from New Zealand's explicit governmental guidance to other, much more flexible arrangements that give the central bank fairly wide latitude in establishing target ranges, choosing indexes, and choosing time periods over which to meet the price stability objectives. There may also be a correlation between governmental involvement and the strictness of the inflation-targeting regime. Involvement has been the greatest in the strictest regime, New Zealand, and is noticeably less in the more flexible regimes. The United States The main country that has not adopted inflation targeting is the United States. Although academic economists and many others have for DATE been urging the Federal Reserve to adopt inflation targeting, legislators have shown very little interest in the issue. Congressman Jim Saxton of New Jersey, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has introduced an inflation-targeting bill several times, but the bill currently has no cosponsors and has not been reviewed recently in committee hearings. Previous inflation-targeting bills have fared no better. This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions. Given the absence of firmer congressional guidance, the Federal Reserve has continued to operate under the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of DATE. This act directs the Fed to \"promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" Should these goals be in conflict, it is up to the Fed to resolve the problem. To say the least, the U.S. approach is a rather stark contrast with the approach in New Zealand with its policy agreements and in Canada with its joint announcements. Academics and others urge the Federal Reserve to adopt inflation targeting, but should the Fed do so on its own? If the Fed does something on its own, how strict an inflation-targeting regime should it be? The politics of inflation targeting have never been fully explored. We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries. These targeting countries typically operate under a parliamentary form of government, under which the Treasury secretary or chancellor of the Exchequer is speaking for the whole government, both the executive and the legislative branches. There would be many more complications in the United States - the Federal Reserve would have to coordinate with the Treasury secretary, representing the executive branch, and members of the Congress. When the Congressional Budget Office deals with the Congress, it coordinates between both parties and both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Fed might not have to coordinate with both houses of the Congress, but it would certainly have to coordinate with both parties. This problem is not necessarily insuperable; all political actors might recognize the value of price stability and might appreciate inflation targeting, at least in its softer form. But at a minimum, political issues are much more complicated in congressional systems than in parliamentary systems. On a more technical level, there are at least two places to look for guidance. A first place is the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act itself. As amended, this act requires the Fed to make a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, accompanied by testimony from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. These reports and testimony have been occasions for the Fed to report on concepts and developments, though never one as significant as inflation targeting. It is hard to imagine the Fed's using these hearings to announce a full-blown inflation-targeting regime, though it is conceivable that the Fed could use them to propose soft target bands for price stability, or at least to get more specific about the Fed's commitment to price stability. But in the end, using the Monetary Policy Reports from the Fed as a means of getting the Congress to endorse inflation targeting would be stretching things. A second place to look for legal guidance is the fact that the Fed also has rule-writing responsibility for several statutes in the consumer area, such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act. In each of these cases, the statute was passed some DATE ago, and the Fed has responsibility for writing rules to keep the statute up-to-date. Periodically the Fed issues advance notices of proposed rulemaking, solicits comments, revises the rules, puts these revisions out for comment, and then adopts final rules. One could imagine a similar process for inflation targeting. For the Fed to write rules for a strict inflation-targeting regime on its own would presumably be impossible, though one might interpret \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" as an invitation for the Fed to write rules to institute a soft form of inflation targeting. On the whole, this precedential guidance is not very helpful. When it has had opportunities, the Congress has never moved ahead on inflation targeting, possibly because of outright opposition, possibly because of a desire for neutral non-involvement. Nor have various recent Administrations expressed much interest, preferring to leave such matters in the hands of the Fed. A Fed announcement about inflation targeting would be much more significant than the other more-technical and more-data-oriented announcements or pronouncements the Fed normally gives in its Monetary Policy Reports. And for the Fed to interpret the broad language of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act as an invitation to write rules instituting a strict form of inflation targeting would be an extreme stretch, though perhaps not for a soft form of inflation targeting. Normative considerations Granted that there is not much legal precedent for going ahead with inflation targeting on its own, would there be any value in having the Fed start a conversation with the Congress? Left to its own devices, the Congress probably will not move ahead on the Saxton bill or anything like it. But what if the Fed were actually to propose a soft form of inflation targeting? Such a proposal might change the dynamics and raise the possibility that the Congress could at least tacitly endorse inflation targeting. The advantages of soliciting congressional support for inflation targeting would be essentially those normally ascribed to inflation targeting in the first place. The Fed's announcements could become clearer and more transparent, its commitment to price stability could become more universally understood, and market participants could have a better idea of what specifically the Fed means by price stability. The present \"bias\" statement in the Fed's announcement of changes in the federal funds rate target could be supplanted with a statement on whether inflation is tending to the upper or lower bound of the Fed's price stability range. I see no particular need to clarify the relationship between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the United States - already there is agreement that the Treasury should be the only agency that comments on currency values, and that the Fed should be the only agency that comments on monetary policy - but added demarcations can never hurt. Another advantage would be that inflation targeting could assist in clarifying roles. When the Chairman testifies on the Monetary Policy Report, most of the questions involve an incredibly broad range of topics - fiscal policy, tax policy, entitlement spending issues, trade issues, and wage distribution questions. Many of these have little to do with the Fed's direct areas of responsibility. I can see a democratic effectiveness argument for rerouting these questions back to the area of direct Federal Reserve responsibility, and discussion of how to implement inflation targeting might well do that. These discussions might also make it clear that price stability - not all these other matters - is the primary economic outcome for which the Fed is responsible. As for the disadvantages, the most significant seems to be explaining why the Fed is specifically delineating only one of its three goals. A DATE macroeconomist would have no trouble in understanding why the Fed would put a target band on inflation but not on unemployment and not on long-term interest rates. In DATE macroeconomics, inflation is a policy choice variable - there is essentially no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and it is up to monetary policy to choose the long-run rate of inflation. Zero inflation, or close to zero depending on measurement error and other technical details, is as good as any other choice in promoting ultimate macroeconomic goals such as full employment and long-term economic growth. Keeping inflation close to zero has the further advantage of limiting the microeconomic costs and tax distortions caused by inflation. Hence a target zone for price stability fits perfectly into the standard macro model. But that's not true for the other parts of the Fed's mandate. Were the Fed, or the Congress, to set a target bound on the unemployment rate, that bound might not be consistent with the so-called natural, or non-inflationary, rate of unemployment. Were the target band, say, below the natural rate, the Fed would be forced to follow policies likely to lead to accelerating inflation. Similarly, a target band for long-term interest rates below the equilibrium long-term rate could also again force the Fed to pump money out to a highly inflationary degree. The difference is all in the way the macroeconomy works. The straightforward way to resolve this impasse is to try to explain it to politicians who remain skeptical. As evidence, one could use DATE and DATE as dramatic indications of what happens when macro policy violates the natural unemployment rate rule and the equilibrium interest rate rule, with rather dire subsequent inflationary consequences. Or the DATEs could be used as an illustration of how monetary policy could lower inflation, with concomitant gains in terms of full employment and long-term economic growth. Similar conversations might have occurred in all those countries where the government seems to have eagerly adopted inflation targeting. But these attempts to explain inflation targeting still might not work, and the Congress might still delineate specific unemployment and interest rate goals along with inflation goals. Were such to be the case, particularly if the specific goals for unemployment or interest rates were set inappropriately, as was done in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of the late DATE, I believe that even die-hard advocates of inflation targeting would consider the costs greater than the benefits. Given the already good inflation performance in the United States, the benefits of adopting inflation targeting are likely to be modest. But in an inappropriately constrained system, the costs could be enormous. Another potential political cost of inflation targeting involves loss of flexibility. As inflation targeting has evolved in other countries, and in the thinking of academic economists, a flexible approach to inflation targeting has proved quite popular. Specific goals for inflation are important, yes, but not under any and all circumstances. Real-world economies are subject to unanticipated shocks and unanticipated financial crises. Sometimes monetary authorities, even under inflation targeting, must respond to these shocks by going outside the price stability band for a short period. For example, the ECB has held its short-term interest rate at a low level for a significant period even though inflation has been slightly above its target ceiling most of that time. Many outside observers believe that economic sluggishness is the real problem in Europe and are quite sympathetic with the ECB strategy, even though it may violate a strict interpretation of inflation targeting. Most experts and others interested in inflation targeting understand this need for flexibility and are quite comfortable with flexible inflation-targeting schemes. In all likelihood, any scheme designed for the United States would feature such flexibility. So far there is no problem, but there could be at least a political awkwardness to such a situation. The Federal Reserve is responsible for many controversial policies - sometimes its approval or disapproval of bank mergers is controversial, sometimes its safety and soundness supervision is controversial, and sometimes its consumer protection regulations are controversial. At any point, some observers and some politicians are likely to be upset at the Fed for one reason or another. Were the inflation rate temporarily outside the target band, even for good economic reasons, the mere existence of inflation targets could be another excuse for tension between the Fed and the Congress. There is almost always at least potential tension between the Fed and the Congress, and both sides have learned how to handle it. But at least some danger lies in introducing new possibilities for tension. None of these supposed political costs of inflation targeting are certain, all could be readily handled, and it is at least possible that only vague congressional support for inflation targeting would ultimately be necessary. But we should recognize that same clarity of inflation targeting that has generally proved advantageous in other countries contains at least the seeds for potential disagreements in the United States. Conclusion All debates about whether the United States should adopt inflation targeting are fairly amorphous, balancing speculative theoretical considerations and imaging hypothetical situations. Given the good inflationary performance of the American economy in DATE, the question of whether to adopt inflation targeting has never been an all-out do-or-die issue. The most that pro-targeters have been able to claim is some possible benefits; and anti-targeters, some possible costs. In this amorphous debate, the political questions are perhaps the most amorphous of all. But surely it is relevant that, in other countries that have adopted inflation targeting, the parliamentary governments have generally been strong supporters, whereas in the United States Administration and congressional support has ranged from weak to non-existent. This lack of support could well change as the Administration and the Congress became more familiar with inflation targeting and, in particular, the possible flexibility of the regime. But if it does not change, or if it takes the form of inappropriate targets for other macroeconomic objectives, it becomes a definite impediment to the adoption of inflation targeting by the United States.",

Vice President Papademos, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to the fourth conference of the International Research Forum for Monetary Policy. The forum is one outgrowth of the increased interaction between central banks and academic institutions that, in my opinion, benefits both groups. It is a true joint effort involving the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve Board, the BMW Institute for German and European Studies at Georgetown University, and the Centre for Financial Studies at Goethe University in Frankfurt. You have a very full agenda for DATE. The topics represent a good mix of theoretical work as well as empirical work based on both calibration and econometric estimation. You are beginning with two papers that emphasize the importance of inflation expectations. Other papers examine such topics as the application of search theory, the functioning of mortgage markets, the theoretical analysis of optimal monetary policy, and empirical research on price-setting. There is a lot of intellectual food on the table. Bon appetit!",

                  "Donald L Kohn: Monetary policy perspectives on risk premiums in financial markets Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Financial Market Risk Premiums Conference, Federal Reserve Board, Washington DC, DATE.    I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this conference on the time variation and macroeconomic links of financial market risk premiums. Steven Sharpe, Paul Harrison, and Hao Zhou are to be congratulated for putting together an interesting program that should advance our understanding of this important topic. Although your papers concentrate on the equity premium, I would like to take TIME DATE to broaden the discussion to encompass risk premiums in other markets and to highlight the connections between risk premiums and monetary policy. My goal is not to draw conclusions on recent movements in risk premiums but rather to give you a sense of how estimates of risk premiums may influence our policy decisionmaking, to note some of the difficulties that we face in interpreting their movements, and, I hope, to stimulate further research in this already fertile field.NUM At the Federal Reserve, we pay a lot of attention to financial market prices in the formulation of monetary policy. Financial markets are the channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the risks around those expectations. An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain. To be clear, when I say \"risk premium\" I mean the additional compensation required by investors for holding a risky security--that is, one with uncertain returns--above the compensation that would be demanded by risk-neutral investors who care only about expected returns. For example, while a risk-neutral investor would demand a certain spread on a junk bond over a risk-free rate of the same maturity as compensation for expected losses, a risk-averse investor likely requires an even wider spread depending on the covariance characteristics of the bond's total return. In the Treasury market, risk--or term--premiums are generally evident as maturities extend and reflect mostly the interaction of risk aversion and uncertainty about the future path of interest rates. When applied to credit markets, the term \"risk premium\" is sometimes used in a broader sense to include expected losses, but I am thinking of risk premiums as the extra compensation for the uncertainty around anticipated economic and financial outcomes. This compensation is determined by both perception of risks and investor preferences, or risk aversion. Among the risk premiums that we monitor regularly at the Federal Reserve are those on equity returns, equity volatility, corporate bonds, and Treasury securities. Each contains information about a different risk around a different expected outcome. Clearly, the separation of market prices into distinct pieces reflecting expected values and risk is a difficult task that relies heavily on modeling assumptions about underlying processes and investor behavior. Indeed, think of all the constituents of, say, a long-term corporate bond yield. Such a yield encompasses compensation for expected real rates, for expected inflation, for expected default, and for the expected liquidity in the instrument, and it contains conceptually separate risk premiums for uncertainty about each of these underlying factors. In principle, an ideal model would account for each of those components separately. In practice, however, we have yet to achieve such a fine breakdown, and the estimate of any one or group of those components is likely to be highly dependent on the estimates of the others. Although some promising research on modeling these components--jointly or individually--is under way, we need to be especially aware of our theoretical and empirical limitations when interpreting market price movements. But these qualifications do not diminish the point that risk premiums are certainly relevant for monetary policy deliberations, and we do pay attention to our best estimates of them. We, as policymakers, form our own independent view of the expected path of a number of macroeconomic and financial variables, but we are also obviously interested in gauging investors' expectations about the future paths of those same variables. Investor expectations shape the market reaction to new economic data and to our policy actions, and when those expectations differ from our own, they could embed information that we might wish to factor into our own analysis. Investors' expectations are reflected in asset prices, but so are risk premiums, and inferences about future economic conditions obtained from market prices are conditional on estimates of those premiums. Neglecting or grossly misestimating risk premiums will lead to misperceptions of the market's outlook and thus potentially to market moves that we did not anticipate. Nothing better illustrates the need to properly account for risk premiums than the current interest rate environment: To what extent are longterm interest rates low because investors expect short-term rates to be low in the future due to some underlying softness in aggregate demand, and to what extent do low long rates reflect narrow term premiums, perhaps induced by well-anchored inflation expectations or low macroeconomic volatility? Clearly, the policy implications of these two alternative explanations are very different. While judging investors' expectations is important when setting monetary policy, so is understanding investors' sense of the distribution of possible outcomes around those expectations. Market risk premiums may well be an input into our own perceptions of the range of possible economic outcomes, and our policy actions can be influenced by those perceptions. For example, our reaction to a scenario in which inflation is low and is expected to vary within a narrow band would presumably be different than our reaction to an alternative scenario in which inflation uncertainty was high and there was a significant chance of entering a deflationary environment. Thus, we are also interested in risk premiums as indicators of uncertainty and not solely as inputs into accurate readings of investors' mean economic outlook. So far I have largely considered risk premiums as indicators of economic conditions, but they can also directly affect real economic activity. For example, the decline in term premiums in the Treasury market of late may have contributed to keeping long-term interest rates relatively low and, consequently, may have supported the housing sector and consumer spending more generally. Also, risk premiums may be, in part, a manifestation of investor sentiment, which in turn may be correlated with consumer and business sentiment. Accordingly, it is possible that risk premiums may reflect broader \"animal spirits\" in a Keynesian sense, and thus they could be a marker for shifts in underlying business and consumer spending trends. Consider the dramatic example of the turnaround in equity markets from DATE to DATE: The pullback of both real and financial risk-taking that accompanied it surely was a significant drag on the economy. Risk premiums may even have a role in credit cycles: Some research here at the Board has shown that corporate bonds issued when risk premiums are low default at a higher rate than bonds issued when risk premiums are high, even when conditioning on their observable risk.NUM Other research has drawn similar underperformance conclusions about stock returns following initial public offerings.NUM Finally, risk premiums are also important tools for monitoring financial stability. A strong, stable financial system is of vital importance both for a robust economy and as a support for an effective monetary policy. Information that bears on investors' attitudes toward risk and on the functioning of financial markets and financial institutions is thus undoubtedly valuable. It certainly was, for example, in DATE, when virtually every risk premium measure that we monitor appeared to indicate a sharp withdrawal from risk-taking on the part of investors. That withdrawal threatened financial stability and, as a consequence, real activity; the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) risk-management approach to policy dictated that the target rate be eased enough to substantially reduce the odds on a very adverse outcome. As you can see, we read risk premiums in a variety of ways and for a variety of purposes. Because we conduct policy in real time, our attention is often drawn to movements in risk premiums as they occur, especially if they appear to deviate from long-established patterns. Thus, we try first of all to develop a good understanding of the historical behavior of risk premiums. The top panel of the exhibit that I have passed around shows crude estimates, put together by the Board's staff, of the risk premium on both equities and corporate bonds going back to DATE. The equity risk premium is constructed by subtracting the real Aaa corporate yield from the ratio of trend earnings to prices as a measure of expected equity returns. The corporate bond risk premium is constructed as the expected excess rate of return of Baa over Aaa corporate bonds using expected default rates from a simple regression model. The configuration of risk premiums in DATE presents both similarities and contrasts to the behavior of risk premiums in current times. DATE, like the present, was a time of low interest rates and low inflation, and the corporate bond risk premium was low, just as it is DATE. But our estimates suggest that the equity premium for that period was substantially higher than it appears to be DATE. To an extent, that may have been a manifestation of a lingering reluctance to hold equity for a generation that had been chastened by the Great Depression; asset preferences apparently were skewed in ways that could not be readily attributed to objective differences in the risks of holding credit and equity claims on businesses. The other aspect of the chart that stands out is the apparent decline in risk measures since DATE and DATE. The moderation in real output volatility, along with the decline in inflation and its stabilization around low levels, probably reduced perceptions of how much economic and financial variables would possibly deviate from expectations and may thus account for part of the explanation for the decline in risk premiums. I know part of this has already been discussed TIME, and will, no doubt, also be featured during the remainder of the conference, given its fundamental nature and potential to explain declines in risk premiums across markets. But I am intrigued by efforts to separate the extent to which the decline in risk premiums in DATE is due to a reduction in inflation versus a reduction in real output volatility. In that regard, does the fact that most of the decline occurred by DATE suggest that inflation control played a more important role than the damping of business cycles, which might reveal itself more gradually over time? However, even if we think we understand the trends, the challenges become more pressing when we look at movements in, and relationships among, risk premiums as they happen. Our first challenge is to determine when a movement is not just noise that will quickly reverse, but rather a signal of something important that we need to understand as we formulate policy. For example, does the backup in the equity risk premium over DATE arise from some deep-seated and long-lasting macroeconomic cause that we need to consider for our policy decisions, or is it a mere blip? To separate signal from noise, we try to look not only at the persistence of movements but also at their correlation across markets. Is there a widespread increase or decrease in risk aversion or in perceived risk that suggests a shift in underlying attitudes and expectations? If there is, the monetary authority may well need to adjust the stance of policy as the FOMC did in DATE. Disparate movements in risk premiums, such as those we witnessed in equity and fixed income markets recently and that are highlighted in the bottom panel of the exhibit, are not unusual and can occur for a number of reasons. For one, we are measuring premiums in various markets that have different risk exposures. Securities with different pay-off structures naturally may react differently to a given shock. For example, a relatively modest downward revision to expected spending may raise more questions about returns on equity than on corporate debt. Alternatively, markets may be reacting to different shocks, or to changes to the capital structure of firms; over DATE, lengthening debt maturities and increases in liquid asset holdings may have supported debt holders at the expense of equity holders. Or, as in DATE, perceptions may shift as a consequence of recent events. From time to time, risk premiums also may be affected by changes in demand and supply driven by legal or regulatory requirements, by exogenous changes in issuance patterns, or by shifting asset preferences for reasons unrelated to changing expectations or attitudes toward risk. To repeat, divergences in risk premiums are not necessarily unusual if looked at from a historical perspective. And surely different co-movements can reflect different risks--or risk shifts--and different preferences--or preference shifts--which can change the equilibrium relation across markets. But an understanding of what caused the divergent movements could be important for policymakers. For example, changes in perceived risk in some specific markets might point to certain economic weaknesses that policy may need to address. On the other hand, a shift in asset preferences that raised premiums in some markets but lowered them in others could potentially leave overall financial conditions, and their implications for spending, not much changed. Thus, it is important for policymakers to look at risk premiums in their entirety, rather than in isolation, before reaching policy conclusions. DATE I have mostly characterized policymakers as avid readers of risk perceptions across markets, but our actions could affect risk premiums as well. For instance, an effective monetary policy may well have been one factor in the great moderation of inflation and business cycles that I mentioned earlier. And our efforts in DATE to make the policymaking process more transparent may, almost by definition, have reduced uncertainty and thus compressed risk premiums. We have emphasized the conditional nature of our discussions of future policy to help market participants calibrate their assessments and price risk. To the extent that the decline in risk premiums induced by clearer policy communication has accurately reflected the decrease in uncertainty, assets will be better priced. Finally, some have asserted that our accommodative policy stance in DATE, made necessary by the macroeconomic situation, itself has tended to drive down risk premiums as investors \"reached for yield.\" Notably, however, most risk spreads have remained narrow even as we have been removing policy accommodation. My purpose DATE has not been to interpret or forecast risk premiums or the specific way in which they will affect the future path of monetary policy. Rather, I have taken advantage of a captive audience of researchers on this topic to try to impress on you the importance to the central bank of research along these lines. By outlining how we use estimates of risk premiums and the complications we have encountered, I hope I have given you a sense that we are a ready market for work that improves our understanding of the topic. Any such improvement will help us interpret financial developments as we conduct monetary policy in pursuit of our goals of economic growth and price stability.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Inflation expectations and inflation forecasting Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Monetary Economics Workshop of the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website. I would like to thank Christina Romer and David Romer for giving me the chance to address participants in the Summer Institute, sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). As an academic, I regularly attended the Summer Institute and presented or commented on research here. I also served for a time as the director of the Monetary Economics group, the position now shared by David and Christina. The informal nature of the institute, the large number of talented people in attendance, and the opportunity to hear about the very latest work in the field - often while in early draft form - made DATE each summer one of the most stimulating times of DATE for me. In my current position, I am keenly aware of the long history of fruitful interaction between economists inside and outside of central banks, and I am eager to see this interaction continue. This ongoing intellectual exchange, by improving our understanding of the economy and the workings of monetary policy, has had and will continue to have sizable benefits. DATE I will offer a few remarks on the relationships among monetary policy, inflation, and the public's expectations of inflation, focusing - as seems appropriate for this audience - on some important open questions. I will also give a short overview of the way the Federal Reserve Board staff forecasts inflation, including some discussion of how the staff incorporates information about expected inflation into its forecasting process. As you know, the control of inflation is central to good monetary policy. Price stability, which is one leg of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from the Congress, is a good thing in itself, for reasons that economists understand much better DATE than they did DATE. Inflation injects noise into the price system, makes long-term financial planning more complex, and interacts in perverse ways with imperfectly indexed tax and accounting rules. In the short-to-medium term, the maintenance of price stability helps avoid the pattern of stop-go monetary policies that were the source of much instability in output and employment in the past. More fundamentally, experience suggests that high and persistent inflation undermines public confidence in the economy and in the management of economic policy generally, with potentially adverse effects on risk-taking, investment, and other productive activities that are sensitive to the public's assessments of the prospects for future economic stability. In the long term, low inflation promotes growth, efficiency, and stability - which, all else being equal, support maximum sustainable employment, the other leg of the mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress. Admittedly, measuring the long-term relationship between growth or productivity and inflation is difficult. For example, it may be that low inflation has accompanied good economic performance in part because countries that maintain low inflation tend to pursue other sound economic policies as well. Still, I think we can agree that, at a minimum, the opposite proposition - that inflationary policies promote employment growth in the long run - has been entirely discredited and, indeed, that policies based on this proposition have led to very bad outcomes whenever they have been applied. Inflations expectations - conceptual frameworks Undoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation and thus the central bank's ability to achieve price stability. But what do we mean, precisely, by \"the state of inflation expectations\"? How should we measure inflation expectations, and how should we use that information for forecasting and controlling inflation? I certainly do not have complete answers to those questions, but I believe that they are of great practical importance. I hope my remarks here will stimulate some of you to work on these issues. What is the right conceptual framework for thinking about inflation expectations in the current context? The traditional rational-expectations model of inflation and inflation expectations has been a useful workhorse for thinking about issues of credibility and institutional design, but, to my mind, it is less helpful for thinking about economies in which (NUM) the structure of the economy is constantly evolving in ways that are imperfectly understood by both the public and policymakers and (NUM) the policymakers' objective function is not fully known by private agents. In particular, together with the assumption that the central bank's objective function is fixed and known to the public, the traditional rational-expectations approach implies that the public has firm knowledge of the long-run equilibrium inflation rate; consequently, their longrun inflation expectations do not vary over time in response to new information. But in fact, as I will discuss in more detail later, long-run inflation expectations do vary over time. That is, they are not perfectly anchored in real economies; moreover, the extent to which they are anchored can change, depending on economic developments and (most important) the current and past conduct of monetary policy. In this context, I use the term \"anchored\" to mean relatively insensitive to incoming data. So, for example, if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their long-run expectation, but their long-run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, then inflation expectations are well anchored. If, on the other hand, the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably, then expectations are poorly anchored. Although variations in the extent to which inflation expectations are anchored are not easily handled in a traditional rational-expectations framework, they seem to fit quite naturally into the burgeoning literature on learning in macroeconomics. The premise of this literature is that people do not have full information about the economy or about the objectives of the central bank, but they instead must make statistical inferences about the unknown parameters governing the evolution of the economy. In a learning context, the concept of anchored expectations is easily formalized in a variety of ways; in general, if the public is modeled as being confident in its current estimate of the long-run inflation rate, so that new information has relatively little effect on that estimate, then the essential idea of well-anchored expectations has been captured. Allowing for learning has important implications for how we think about the economy and policy. For example, some work has shown that the process of learning can affect the dynamics and even the potential stability of the economy (see, of many possible examples, Bullard and Mitra, DATE). Considerations of how the public learns about the economy affect the form of optimal monetary policy (Gaspar, Smets, and Vestin, DATE). Notably, in a world with rational expectations and in which private agents are assumed already to understand all aspects of the economic environment, talking about the effects of central bank communication would not be sensible, whereas models with learning accommodate the analysis of communication-related issues quite well (Orphanides and Williams, DATE; Bernanke, DATE). Macroeconomic models with learning also give content to the idea of an economy moving gradually from one regime to another, particularly if the central bank as well as the public is assumed to be updating its beliefs. For example, if the central bank and the public learn from experience that high inflation imposes greater costs and fewer benefits than previously thought, then the equilibrium will adjust toward one with lower inflation and lower inflation expectations. This line of explanation of how economies move between monetary regimes, which has been explored by Sargent and others, strikes me as quite plausible as a historical description (Sargent, DATE). In sum, many of the most interesting issues in contemporary monetary theory require an analytical framework that involves learning by private agents and possibly the central bank as well. Implications of anchored inflation expectations Why do we care about the variability of inflation expectations? As my colleague Rick Mishkin recently discussed, the extent to which inflation expectations are anchored has first-order implications for the performance of inflation and of the economy more generally (Mishkin, DATE). Mishkin illustrated this point by considering the implications of the fact that inflation expectations have become much better anchored over DATE for the estimated coefficients of the conventional Phillips curve, which I define here to encompass specifications that use lagged values of inflation to proxy for expectations or other sources of inflation inertia. As he noted, many studies of the conventional Phillips curve find that the sensitivity of inflation to activity indicators is lower DATE than in the past (that is, the Phillips curve appears to have become flatter);NUM and that the long-run effect on inflation of \"supply shocks,\" such as changes in the price of oil, also appears to be lower than in the past (Hooker, DATE). These findings are of much more than academic interest. To the extent that the Phillips curve may have flattened, inflation will now tend to be more stable than in the past in the face of variations in aggregate demand. (Of course, this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on whether inflation expectations are anchored in the vicinity of price stability.) Likewise, a lower sensitivity of long-run inflation to supply shocks would imply that such shocks are much less likely to generate economic instability DATE than they would have been DATE. Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over DATE have not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast (for example) to the U.S. experience of DATE. Various factors might account for these changes in the Phillips curve, but, as Mishkin pointed out, better-anchored inflation expectations - themselves, of course, the product of monetary policies that brought inflation down and have kept it relatively stable - certainly play some role. If people set prices and wages with reference to the rate of inflation they expect in the long run and if inflation expectations respond less than previously to variations in economic activity, then inflation itself will become relatively more insensitive to the level of activity - that is, the conventional Phillips curve will be flatter. Similar logic explains the finding that inflation is less responsive than it used to be to changes in oil prices and other supply shocks. Certainly, increases in energy prices affect overall inflation in the short run because energy products such as gasoline are part of the consumer's basket and because energy costs loom large in the production of some goods and services. However, a one-off change in energy prices can translate into persistent inflation only if it leads to higher expected inflation and a consequent \"wage-price spiral.\" With inflation expectations well anchored, a one-time increase in energy prices should not lead to a permanent increase in inflation but only to a change in relative prices. A related implication is that, if inflation expectations are well anchored, changes in energy (and food) prices should have relatively little influence on \"core\" inflation, that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy. Although inflation expectations seem much better anchored DATE than they were DATE, they appear to remain imperfectly anchored. A number of studies confirm that observation. For example, Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (DATE) found that long-run inflation expectations, as measured by the difference in yields between nominal and inflationindexed bonds, move in response to news about the economy, rather than remaining unaffected. Levin, Natalucci, and Piger (DATE) have shown that some survey measures of inflation expectations in the United States respond to recent changes in the actual rate of inflation, which would not be the case if expectations were perfectly anchored. Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, DATE; Rudebusch and Wu, DATE; Cogley, DATE). An indirect but elegant way to make the point that inflation expectations remain imperfectly anchored comes from a statistical analysis of inflation by Stock and Watson (DATE). Stock and Watson model inflation as having two components, which may be interpreted as the trend and the cycle. Changes in the trend component are highly persistent whereas shocks to the cyclical component are temporary.NUM The key finding of this research is that the variability of the trend component of inflation (and thus the share of the overall variability of inflation that it can explain) appears to have fallen significantly after DATE. That is, unexpected changes in inflation are DATE much more likely to be transitory than they were before DATE. Because it seems quite unlikely that changes in inflation could persist indefinitely unless long-run expectations of inflation also changed, I interpret the StockWatson finding as consistent with the view that inflation expectations have become much more anchored since DATE. At the same time, that the variability of the trend component of inflation, though modest, remains positive, implies that long-run expectations of inflation are not perfectly anchored DATE. The policy implications of the much-improved but still imperfect anchoring of inflation expectations are not at all straightforward. To evaluate these implications, we must understand better the historical variation in inflation expectations, the effect of this variation on actual inflation and economic activity, and the relationship between policy actions and the formation of inflation expectations. With the hope of promoting progress on these broad topics, I pose three questions to researchers, the answer to any of which would be quite useful for practical policymaking. First, how should the central bank best monitor the public's inflation expectations? Theoretical treatments tend to neglect the fact that in practice many measures of inflation expectations exist, including the forecasts of professional economists, results from surveys of consumers, information extracted from financial markets such as the market for inflationindexed debt, and limited information on firms' pricing plans. In a very interesting paper, Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers (DATE) compared the available measures, emphasizing in particular that median measures of inflation expectations often obscure substantial crosssectional dispersion of expectations.NUM On which measure or combination of measures should central bankers focus to assess inflation developments and the degree to which expectations are anchored? Do we need new measures of expectations or new surveys? Information on the price expectations of businesses - who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance - as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce. Second, how do changes in various measures of inflation expectations feed through to actual pricing behavior? Promising recent research has looked at price changes at very disaggregated levels for insight into the pricing decision (Bils and Klenow, DATE; Nakamura and Steinsson, DATE). But this research has not yet linked pricing decisions at the microeconomic level to inflation expectations; undertaking that next step would no doubt be difficult but also very valuable. Third, what factors affect the level of inflation expectations and the degree to which they are anchored? Answering this question essentially involves estimating the learning rule followed by the public or various components of the public, although one could consider alternative frameworks like Carroll's (DATE) epidemiological model of the propagation of information among private agents. A fuller understanding of the public's learning rules would improve the central bank's capacity to assess its own credibility, to evaluate the implications of its policy decisions and communications strategy, and perhaps to forecast inflation. Realistically calibrated models with learning would also inform our thinking about policy and the economy. Inflation forecasting at the Federal Reserve I would like to shift gears at this point to tell you a bit about how the Federal Reserve Board staff goes about forecasting inflation. Obviously, this activity provides critical inputs into the making of monetary policy, and as I will discuss, the staff's long-term track record in forecasting inflation is quite good by any reasonable benchmark. I hope that my brief description will stimulate your interest in the complex and challenging problems of real-time macroeconomic forecasting. But, as you will see, the discussion of practical inflation forecasting will bring us back to one theme of my remarks - that our ability to forecast inflation and predict how inflation will respond to policy actions depends very much on our capacity to measure and to understand what determines the public's expectations of inflation. The Board staff employs a variety of formal models, both structural and purely statistical, in its forecasting efforts. However, the forecasts of inflation (and of other key macroeconomic variables) that are provided to the Federal Open Market Committee are developed through an eclectic process that combines model-based projections, anecdotal and other \"extramodel\" information, and professional judgment. In short, for all the advances that have been made in modeling and statistical analysis, practical forecasting continues to involve art as well as science. The forecasting procedures used depend importantly on the forecast horizon. For near-term inflation forecasting - say, for DATE and the next - the staff relies most heavily on a disaggregated, bottom-up approach that focuses on estimating and forecasting price behavior for the various categories of goods and services that make up the aggregate price index in question. For example, we know from historical experience that the prices of some types of goods and services tend to be quite volatile, including not only (as is well known) the prices of energy and some types of food but also some \"core\" prices such as airfares, apparel prices, and hotel rates. The DATE autocorrelations of price changes in these categories tend to be low or even negative. In contrast, changes in inflation rates in some services categories, such as shelter costs, tend to be more persistent. In assessing what price changes in a particular category imply for future price changes in that category, the staff uses not only various forms of time-series analysis but also specialized knowledge about how the various indexes are constructed - for example, whether certain categories are sampled DATE in all localities and how DATE adjustments are performed. In making very near-term price forecasts, the staff also uses diverse information from a variety of sources, such as surveys of prices of gasoline and other important items, news reports about price-change announcements, and anecdotal information from our business contacts. Conceptually, one might think of this effort to distinguish transitory from persistent price changes as a more nuanced way of estimating the underlying inflation trend, analogous to the trend measures provided by more mechanical indicators such as trimmed-mean or weighted-median inflation rates. An accurate forecast of very near-term inflation is important not only for its own sake but also because it provides a better \"jumping-off point\" for the longer-term forecast. Because inflation continues to exhibit some inertia, improved near-term forecasts translate into more-accurate longer-term projections as well. For forecasting horizons beyond DATE two, detailed analyses of individual price components become less useful, and thus the staff's emphasis shifts to inflation's fundamental determinants. Food and energy inflation are forecasted separately from the core, using information from futures prices and other sources. However, forecasts of core inflation must take into account the extent to which food and energy costs are passed through to other prices. To project core inflation at longer-term horizons, the staff consults a range of econometric models. Most of the models used are based on versions of the new Keynesian Phillips curve, which links inflation to inflation expectations, the extent of economic slack, and indicators of supply shocks. Despite the common conceptual framework, the model specifications employed differ considerably in their details, including how lagged inflation enters the equation, how resource utilization is measured, and whether a survey-based measure of inflation expectations is included. In principle, formal econometric tests could determine how much weight should be put on the forecast of each model, but in practice the data do not permit sharp inferences; moreover, estimated forecasting equations may not reflect information about special factors affecting the outlook. Because of these considerations, as I have already noted, the staff's inflation forecasts inevitably reflect a substantial degree of expert judgment and the use of information not captured by the models. Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending. Achieving this consistency requires a thoughtful understanding of why sectoral forecasts may be at odds and how best to reconcile those differences. Again, in principle, consistency of sectoral forecasts could be ensured by estimating the inflation equation as part of a general equilibrium system. Indeed, considerable progress has been made in DATE, at the Board and elsewhere, in developing dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models detailed enough for policy application. These models have become increasingly useful for policy analysis and for the simulation of alternative scenarios. They are likely to play a more significant role in the forecasting process over time as well, though, like other formal methods, they are unlikely to displace expert judgment. A potential drawback of the simple Phillips curve model for analyzing and forecasting inflation is that it does not explicitly incorporate the possible influence of labor costs on the inflation process. The Board's large macroeconomic simulation model, known as FRB/US, projects inflation through a system approach that captures the interaction of wage and price determination. Interestingly, however, the system approach does not seem to forecast price inflation as well as single-equation Phillips curve models do. This weaker performance appears to reflect, at least in part, the shortcomings of the available data on labor compensation. The two principal DATE indicators of aggregate TIME compensation are the employment cost index (ECI) and nonfarm compensation per hour (CPH). Both are imperfect measures of the labor costs relevant to pricing decisions. For example, the ECI's fixed employment and occupation weights may not reflect changes in the labor market, and the ECI excludes stock options and similar forms of payment. CPH is volatile, perhaps in part because it measures stock options at exercise rather than when granted, and it is subject to substantial revisions. Moreover, these two TIME compensation measures often give contradictory signals. Despite these problems, labor market developments certainly influence how the staff and policymakers view the inflation process and inflation risks, illustrating yet another point in the forecasting process at which judgment must play an important role. In particular, in evaluating labor-market conditions and trends in labor costs, the staff takes note of a wide range of data, anecdotes, and other qualitative information as well as the official data on compensation. Overall, the Board staff's inflation forecasting has been remarkably good, at least compared with the available alternatives (Romer and Romer, DATE; Sims, DATE). To cite a recent study, Faust and Wright (DATE) show that real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons and that this advantage is not solely the result of the staff's expertise at estimating near-term inflation rates. To link this discussion of forecasting to the first portion of my remarks, I turn to the treatment of inflation expectations in staff forecasts. As I noted earlier, while inflation expectations doubtless are crucial determinants of observed inflation, measuring expectations and inferring just how they affect inflation are difficult tasks. A popular shortcut is to include lagged inflation terms in the Phillips curve equation; besides being a convenient means of capturing the inertial component in inflation, the estimated coefficients on lagged inflation almost certainly reflect to some degree the formation of inflation expectations and their influence on the inflation process. However, using lagged inflation as a proxy for inflation expectations has drawbacks, notably its susceptibility to the Lucas critique.NUM The staff consequently analyzes a number of survey measures of inflation expectations. One question in choosing among measures of expectations is whether to focus on measures of short-term inflation expectations (say, DATE) or of longer-term expectations (DATE). Generally, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the five-toten-year expected inflation measures from the Michigan/Reuters survey of households and from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, seem to be better gauges of the expectations that influence wage- and price-setting behavior. The staff also looks at measures derived from comparing yields on nominal and inflationindexed Treasury securities (the breakeven inflation rate). Measures of inflation compensation derived from the market for inflation-indexed securities are influenced by changes in inflation risk premiums and liquidity premiums, and analyses are constrained by the fact that these markets have been operating in the United States for only a relatively short period. Nevertheless, unlike survey measures, breakeven inflation rates are determined in a market in which investors back their views with real money. Moreover, breakeven measures of inflation expectations provide information on the expectations of a different group of agents - financial-market participants - which can be compared with the views of economists and consumers as represented by surveys. Measurement is only one aspect of understanding inflation expectations. We also need a better understanding of how inflation expectations affect actual inflation and of the factors that determine inflation expectations. I will say a few words about the latter issue in the context of the practical problems of forecasting and policy analysis faced by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board. Model-based simulations of the inflation process are useful tools for both forecasting and policy analysis. In conducting such simulations, the analyst must specify how inflation expectations are formed - in particular, how they react to actual changes in the economy and in policy. In most simulations of the FRB/US model, the public is assumed to update its inflation projections based on the historical relationship between inflation and other key economic variables. Essentially, this approach assumes that the public updates its inflation expectations in a sensible way based on economic developments but does not assume that the public has full knowledge of the underlying model of the economy, consistent with the structure of learning models (Brayton and others, DATE). Recent staff work at the Board has analyzed the implications of expanding the set of variables allowed to influence the public's long-term inflation expectations to include, among others, the federal funds rate.NUM If the public's long-term inflation expectations are influenced directly by Fed actions, as this specification suggests, a number of interesting implications follow. One is that the output costs of disinflation may be lower than those suggested by reduced-form-type Phillips curves. Intuitively, if the Fed attempts to disinflate by raising the federal funds rate, the disinflationary effect will be felt not only through the usual output gap channel but also through a direct restraint on long-term inflation expectations. This interpretation is consistent with some analyses of the Volcker disinflation; although the costs of that disinflation were high, they were perhaps less than economists would have predicted in advance, given conventional estimates of the sacrifice ratio (Erceg and Levin, DATE). To be sure, this and similar analyses remain speculative. A good deal more must be done before such work proves a reliable basis for policy choices. Nevertheless, I hope this example illustrates for you the theme of my remarks, that a deeper understanding of the determinants and effects of the public's expectations of inflation could have significant practical payoffs.

                  "Donald L Kohn: John Taylor rules Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Conference on John Taylor's Contributions to Monetary Theory and Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    The role of simple rules in monetary policymaking It is a pleasure and an honor to speak at this conference honoring John Taylor and his contributions to monetary theory and policy. As you have already heard from Chairman Bernanke and the other speakers DATE, John has made a number of seminal contributions to the field of macroeconomics. What has distinguished John's work, in my view, is that he takes policymaking in the real world seriously.NUM Taking policymaking seriously involves understanding the constraints imposed on our decisions by partial information and incomplete knowledge of economic relationships. It also implies the use of empirically valid models that acknowledge the efforts of households and businesses to anticipate the future and maximize their welfare over time. In DATE and DATE, macroeconomics was focused mainly on real business cycles and endogenous growth theory. During this period, John was one of a very small number of academic economists who continued to pursue research aimed at informing the conduct of monetary policy. John's Carnegie Rochester conference paper published in DATE is an excellent example of this research. Importantly, John's legacy to the Federal Reserve has not been confined to enhancing our understanding of monetary policy. In addition, he has turned out legions of students who have followed in his footsteps in their interest in policy. Many of them have spent time in the Federal Reserve, producing a rich array of contributions to policymaking and research. John and I have spent countless TIME discussing how the Federal Reserve arrives at decisions about monetary policy and how it should arrive at decisions. Those conversations began in earnest in DATE, when John was on the Council of Economic Advisers, and they have continued to DATE. They have occurred not only in offices and classrooms in Washington and Stanford and at numerous conferences around the globe, but also around dinner tables in Washington and Palo Alto and on hiking trails from Vermont to Wyoming. Those conversations made me a better policy adviser and then policymaker, and they have had the added and very special bonus of allowing Gail and me to count John and Allyn among our friends. I can't think of a better way to honor John's contributions than to continue that discussion around the dinner tables of Dallas by reflecting on the role of simple rules in informing policymaking. Three benefits of simple rules in monetary policymaking In his Carnegie Rochester conference paper, John considered a simple policy rule under which the nominal federal funds rate is adjusted in response to both the gap between real and trend gross domestic product (GDP) and the gap between the inflation rate and policymakers' target. Based on data for DATE, John calibrated the long-run target for inflation and the two parameters that determine the responsiveness of the federal funds rate to the two gaps. The equilibrium real interest rate was based on a longer history of actual real interest rates. In the handout, Figure 1A depicts the actual nominal funds rate and the Taylor rule prescriptions DATE, as presented in John's paper. Despite its simplicity, this policy rule fits the data remarkably well; it described a period of generally successful policymaking; and it adhered to the Taylor principle of adjusting the nominal rate more than one-for-one with changes in the inflation rate, so it provided a plausible template for future success. It is no wonder that John has been such a dedicated salesman and that his efforts have been so well received in academia and policy councils. Following John's seminal contribution, many other economists have engaged in research on similar policy rules and, together with John, have identified several benefits of such rules in conducting monetary policy. I will elaborate on three of them. The first benefit of looking at a simple rule like John's is that it can provide a useful benchmark for policymakers. It relates policy setting systematically to the state of the economy in a way that, over time, will produce reasonably good outcomes on average. Importantly, the emphasis is on levels and gaps, not growth rates, as inputs to the policy process. This emphasis can be a problem when a level, say of potential GDP, is in question, but in many respects it is also a virtue. For the United States, the two gaps relate directly to the legislative mandate of the Federal Reserve to achieve stable prices and maximum employment. Moreover, those two gaps fit directly into most modern macroeconomic theories, which tell us something about their relationship and how that relationship can be affected by the type of shock hitting the economy. Model uncertainties make the simplicity of the rule particularly important for the policymaker because research suggests that the prescriptions from simple rules can be more robust than optimal-control policies. Optimal-control policies can depend critically on the exact specification of the model, and clearly there is no consensus about which model best describes the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve policymakers are shown several versions of Taylor rules in the material we receive before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I always look at those charts and tables and ask myself whether I am comfortable with any significant deviation of my policy prescription from those of the rules. A second benefit of simple rules is that they help financial market participants form a baseline for expectations regarding the future course of monetary policy. Even if the actual policy process is far more sophisticated than any simple rule could completely describe, the rule often provides a reasonably good approximation of what policymakers decide and a framework for thinking about policy actions. Indeed, many financial market participants have used the Taylor rule to understand U.S. monetary policy over DATE. Investors and other market participants are going to form expectations about policy and act on those expectations. The more accurate and informed those expectations are, the more likely are their actions to reinforce the intended effects of policy. A third benefit is that simple rules can be helpful in the central bank's communication with the general public. Such an understanding is important for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Giving the public some sense of how the central bank sees the output and inflation gaps and how they are expected to evolve will help it understand the central bank's objectives and how policymakers are likely to respond to surprises in incoming data. Four limitations of simple rules Simple rules have limitations, of course, as benchmarks for monetary policy. To quote from John's Carnegie Rochester paper, \"a policy rule can be implemented and operated more informally by policymakers who recognize the general instrument responses that underlie the policy rule, but who also recognize that operating the rule requires judgment and cannot be done by computer\" (p. NUM). In that context, four limitations of simple rules are important. The first limitation is that the use of a Taylor rule requires that a single measure of inflation be used to obtain the rule prescriptions. The price index used by John in the Carnegie Rochester paper was the GDP price deflator. Other researchers have used the inflation measure based on the consumer price index (CPI). Over DATE, the Federal Reserve has emphasized the inflation rate as measured by changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). Many researchers have also explored the use of core price indexes, which exclude the volatile food and energy components, as better predictors of future inflation or as more robust indicators of the sticky prices that some theories say should be the targets of policy. To be sure, over long periods, most of these measures behave very similarly. But policy is made in the here and now, and the various indexes can diverge significantly for long stretches, potentially providing different signals for the appropriate course of monetary policy. Second, the implementation of the Taylor rule and other related rules requires determining the level of the equilibrium real interest rate and the level of potential output; neither of them are observable variables, and both must be inferred from other information. John used NUM percent as a rough guess as to the real federal funds rate that would be consistent with the economy producing at its potential. But the equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate probably varies over time because it depends on factors such as the growth rate of potential output, fiscal policy, and the willingness of savers to supply credit to households and businesses. Inaccurate estimates of this rate will mislead policymakers about the policy stance required to achieve full employment. In a similar vein, real-time estimates of potential output can be derived in a number of ways and - as shown by Orphanides (DATE) and others - they are subject to large and persistent errors. If policymakers inadvertently rely on flawed estimates, they will encounter persistent problems in achieving their inflation objective. The third limitation of using simple rules for monetary policymaking stems from the fact that, by their nature, simple rules involve only a small number of variables. However, the state of a complex economy like that of the United States cannot be fully captured by any small set of summary statistics. Moreover, policy is best made looking forward, that is, on the basis of projections of how inflation and economic activity may evolve. Lagged or current values of the small set of variables used in a given simple rule may not provide a sufficient guide to future economic developments, especially in periods of rapid or unusual change. For these reasons, central banks monitor a wide range of indicators in conducting monetary policy. In his Carnegie Rochester paper, John mentioned the stock market crash of DATE as an example of how other variables can and should influence the course of monetary policy in some situations. The final limitation I want to highlight is that simple policy rules may not capture riskmanagement considerations. In some circumstances, the risks to the outlook or the perceived costs of missing an objective on a particular side may be sufficiently skewed that policymakers will choose to respond by adjusting policy in a way that would not be justified solely by the current state of the economy or the modal outlook for output and inflation gaps. Policy rules around DATE Some of the ambiguities and potential pitfalls in the use of simple policy rules are highlighted by considering their prescriptions for DATE. Turning to Figure 1B, the solid line indicates the actual federal funds rate between the first quarter of DATE and DATE, and the dashed line shows the prescriptions of the Taylor rule using the same methodology that John used in his Jackson Hole remarks this year.NUM For the earlier part of the sample, the prescription from this simple rule tracks the actual funds rate relatively well. As John pointed out, a notable deviation happened beginning in DATE, and I would like to discuss that period to illustrate the limitations I noted earlier. Inflation measure The first limitation is related to the measure used for the inflation variable included in the rules. The rule prescriptions depicted by the dashed line in Figure 1B are based on the headline CPI. But as you know, the FOMC often looks at core inflation, stripping out the effects of energy and food prices, as a better indicator of future price behavior. The dotted line represents the rule prescriptions based on the chain-weighted core CPI, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has produced since DATE. Using this measure lowers the prescribed funds rate by about NUM percentage points during DATE, bringing the rule prescriptions much closer to the actual path of policy. The reason for the improvement is evident from Figure 2A, on the other side of the handout: Even though the headline and core CPI measures were broadly similar in the mid- to DATE, these measures diverged substantially between DATE and NUM. Potential output The second limitation relates to the challenge of judging the level of potential output in real time. To illustrate this point, Figure 2B plots three measures of the output gap. The solid line is the real-time estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that was used in the Taylor rule prescriptions in Figure 1B, while the dashed line depicts the CBO's ex post estimate of the output gap as of DATE. Back in DATE, the CBO estimated that output at that time was below potential by only NUM percent. With the benefit of DATE of data, the CBO currently estimates that the output gap for the first half of DATE was considerably wider - about NUM percent. In addition, the dotted line represents an alternative measure of resource utilization derived from the unemployment rate and an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) taken from the Board staff's FRB/US model. In fact, the unemployment rate was rising through the middle of DATE, so the FOMC had every reason to believe that the output gap was widening at that time. Using this unemploymentbased measure rather than the real-time CBO measure would reduce the prescriptions of simple policy rules by roughly NUM/NUM percentage point in early DATE. Other variables The third limitation in my list was that the small set of economic measures included in simple rules may not fully reflect the state of the economy. Around DATE, financial market conditions may not have been adequately summarized by the assumed NUM percent equilibrium federal funds rate. Accounting scandals caused economic agents to lose confidence in published financial statements and in bond ratings. The result was higher uncertainty about the financial health of firms, and credit spreads widened substantially. Figure 2C shows that risk spreads on corporate bonds were elevated in this period. Other things equal, such spreads would reduce the federal funds rate needed to achieve full employment, perhaps explaining a portion of the gap between the actual federal funds rate and the outcome from the policy rule during this period. Risk management The last item on my list of limitations was that simple rules do not take account of riskmanagement considerations. As shown in Figure 2A, the core CPI inflation rate for DATE was falling toward NUM percent. The real-time reading of the core PCE inflation rate (not shown) was on average even lower than the comparable CPI figure. Given these rates, the possibility of deflation could not be ruled out. We had carefully analyzed the Japanese experience of the DATE; our conclusion was that aggressively moving against the risk of deflation would pay dividends by reducing the odds on needing to deal with the zero bound on nominal interest rates should the economy be hit with another negative shock. This factor is not captured by simple policy rules. A final note I have offered this analysis in the spirit of so many of the discussions I have had with John. His framework has been enormously important to policymaking in the Federal Reserve, and it has yielded many benefits. Nevertheless, it's important to keep in mind that some significant practical limitations also are associated with the application of such rules in real time. In other words, it's not so simple to use simple rules! References Orphanides, Athanasios (DATE). \"The Quest for Prosperity without Inflation,\" Journal of Monetary Economics, vol.

                  "William C Dudley: The case for TIPS - an examination of the costs and benefits Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Inflation-Indexed Securities and Inflation Risk Management Conference, New York, DATE.    Welcome to the New York Fed and to this timely conference on inflation-indexed securities and inflation risk management. Before discussing \"The Case for TIPS\", I would like to thank conference organizers, participants, panelists and supporting Bank staff for planning and putting together DATE's event. In particular, I wanted to thank John Campbell for his contribution to making DATE's conference a reality and I expect that his involvement will heighten attention to this subject and stimulate additional research from the academic community on the topics we discuss here. Over DATE, Treasury has been evaluating the costs and benefits of the TIPS program. Some research studies on this topic have concluded that the incremental financing costs associated with the TIPS program have been substantial; leading some to conclude that the costs may outweigh the benefits. DATE's program, which includes a panel discussion on the welfare benefits of inflation-protected securities, should help to broaden our knowledge on this topic. As the title of my speech suggests, DATE I am going to lay out the reasons why I, along with my colleagues Jennifer Roush and Michelle Steinberg Ezer, believe that the benefits of the TIPS program exceed the costs of the program. Before saying anything more, let me emphasize that the views I express DATE are my own and those of my co-authors and, therefore, may not represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Also, let me note that Jennifer and Michelle are the main authors of this paper. I have ridden along on their coattails. My main contribution was to slow down completion as I had to fit in my very modest contributions around the unfolding financial crisis! Finally, you may be wondering why this is my first speech since I have become president - an odd subject to choose, perhaps, given the ongoing financial crisis? The answer is a simple one, our paper and this conference have been in train for a long time. It is just a coincidence that the conference and my becoming president of the New York Fed have happened to arrive at about the same time. The logic of issuing inflation-protected securities is straightforward. Wouldn't some investors pay a premium - that is, accept a lower expected return - in exchange for guaranteed, full compensation for inflation? Because the United States and a number of other countries decided that the answer was likely to be \"yes,\" they developed an inflation-indexed government debt market. Has the program been a good development from the perspective of the U.S. Treasury? What about from the public's perspective? A good starting point for answering these questions is to account for the costs and benefits of the program relative to an appropriate counterfactual. For example, we might start by comparing the difference in funding costs to the Treasury of TIPS versus a program of comparable duration nominal Treasuries. But we should also be careful not to ignore other potential benefits of the TIPS program. As we see it, these potential benefits include:  the provision of a virtually risk-free investment that provides value to risk-averse investors,  access to a market-determined measure of inflation expectations that can help inform the conduct of monetary policy,  greater diversification of the Treasury's funding sources, which presumably has favorable implications for the Treasury's overall funding costs, and  the potential for TIPS issuance to reduce the variability of the U.S. government's net financial position and provide an explicit incentive for the fiscal authorities to conduct policy with an eye toward the consequences of inflation. Although it is difficult to quantify these benefits, we argue that they are meaningful and should not be ignored in evaluating the benefits of the TIPS program. Turning first to the issue of measuring the impact of TIPS issuance on the government's funding costs, this could be done simply by comparing the ex-post costs of a program of TIPS issuance to the costs of a comparable program of nominal Treasury issuance. Studies1 of this sort have typically shown that TIPS issuance has resulted in a higher net cost to the Treasury. Unfortunately, although this methodology is attractive in its simplicity, it has some flaws that undercut its usefulness in reaching conclusions about the attractiveness of the TIPS program. The problem with an ex-post analysis is that it depends critically upon the performance of inflation over the period in question. If inflation turns out to have been meaningfully different than what was expected at the time of TIPS issuance, then this difference - the so-called \"inflation surprise\" - can be important in affecting the relative costs of TIPS versus nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out to be higher than expected, then TIPS issuance will likely look to have been more expensive than nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out lower, an ex-post analysis will likely show a savings from the TIPS program. very Over the long run - and I mean the long run - there should be roughly as many downward surprises in inflation performance as upward surprises. But within any relatively short period, such as DATE, this certainly does not need to be the case. In other ex-post words, over such a short period, the outcome of an analysis can be heavily influenced by which of the two sides - the Treasury or investors - was the lucky recipient of the net inflation surprise that occurred over the period in question. For example, in countries such as the United Kingdom, where inflation declined following the inception of an inflationlinked debt program, ex-post studies generally suggest that these programs have reduced financing costs for these countries. The fact that the Treasury saved or lost money ex-post is thus not a very reliable guide as to whether the strategic decision to implement a TIPS program has been a good idea. The relevant question is whether the Treasury obtained the financing it needed at a lower ex-ante cost. If the experiment were to be run thousands of times drawing from the underlying distribution of possible inflation outcomes, would Treasury's costs have been lower, on average, with TIPS or with nominal Treasuries? To conclude on the basis of one coin flip or roll of the dice as ex-post analysis essentially does surely is not the best way to evaluate the respective costs of TIPS issuance versus nominal Treasuries. ex-ante Thus, we need to focus on the underlying factors that determine the difference in costs. There are two primary factors2 underlying the relative cost differences: NUM) the compensation investors require to hold a security that is less liquid than its nominal counterpart, termed the illiquidity premium, and NUM) the insurance value they attach to obtaining protection against inflation risk, known as the inflation risk premium. With regard to the first factor, when investors are worried about their ability to resell TIPS in a liquid secondary market, they require compensation for holding the securities compared with more liquid alternatives. This illiquidity premium tends to drive up TIPS yields and increase the Treasury's borrowing costs. The second factor works in the opposite direction. To the extent that investors are willing to pay for inflation protection, they would purchase TIPS at a price above that implied by their expected payment stream. As such, inflation risk premiums result in lower expected borrowing costs for the government and savings for the TIPS program compared with nominal issuance. To determine which factor has been historically dominant, we conduct an ex-ante cost analysis: We compare the amount that the Treasury received for inflation compensation at auction with an observable measure of the inflation expectations of TIPS investors that is not contaminated by premiums for inflation risk or liquidity differentials. Unfortunately, we don't have a perfect measure of expected inflation. Nevertheless, we may be able to get close. We do have estimates of expected inflation from other sources - such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. If such measures do indeed reflect the inflation expectations of investors, then we can conduct a reasonably accurate ex-ante analysis. TIPS analysts often talk about a concept they call the breakeven inflation rate. Essentially, this is the realized inflation rate that would cause investors to come out the same in terms of total compensation regardless of whether they had bought TIPS or nominal Treasuries. The difference between the auction breakeven inflation rate and the SPF forecast yields a measure of the net savings or loss incurred by the Treasury that is independent of forecast errors. It is also equal to the net value of the illiquidity and inflation risk premiums associated with each TIPS. Our analysis, which covers TIPS auctions through DATE, found that prior to DATE, the breakeven inflation rate was below the SPF. This indicates that the illiquidity premiums exceeded the inflation risk premium over this period. However, since DATE, we find that breakeven inflation rates were approximately equal to expected inflation, indicating that investors were roughly indifferent between the benefit of being protected against inflation risk versus the cost in terms of the greater illiquidity of TIPS relative to onthe-run nominal Treasuries. Thus, on an ex-ante basis, it appeared that the cost of issuing TIPS was about equal to the cost of issuing nominal Treasuries. To determine the impact of the illiquidity premium and inflation risk premium on these results, we decomposed our ex-ante analysis, comparing the breakeven rate of inflation excluding the illiquidity premium in TIPS yields3 to the SPF forecast. This comparison yields an estimate of the premium investors were willing to pay for inflation protection at previous TIPS auctions. We found an average risk premium estimate of NUM basis points over our sample period. This suggests that the TIPS program does satisfy a real demand that is not met by nominal Treasuries. It also suggests that if the Treasury were to take steps to shrink the illiquidity premium by, for example, improving secondary market trading in TIPS, this would shift the cost-benefit analysis more firmly in TIPS direction. A change in the TIPS illiquidity premium can have a notable impact on ex-ante cost analysis. For example, at the time this speech was written, the DATE TIPS breakeven rate was approximately NUM percent, compared to the SPF forecast of NUM percent. This is in contrast to the end of our sample period, which showed them to be about equal. This means that DATE TIPS issuance is not very compelling. But it is important to emphasize that this shift has occurred at a time when the preference for liquidity is especially strong, benefitting nominal Treasuries versus TIPS. When the market turmoil subsides and this illiquidity premium shrinks, one might expect TIPS to again move ahead on an ex-ante basis. So, at this point, the TIPS versus nominal issuance debate is inconclusive. But that's before we have included some of the other considerable - although more difficult to quantify - benefits associated with TIPS issuance. Let me now discuss some of these other benefits. Inflation hedge for households First, TIPS offer a benefit to investors because they have less risk than any other asset class. With virtually no credit risk or inflation risk, TIPS are one of the safest of investments.NUM For investors that want such safety, TIPS offer significant benefits. Furthermore, the ability for investors to choose the amount of inflation risk they hold may result in a more optimal allocation of risk among investors with different tolerances.NUM How much is this worth? Is the value of this completely captured in the relative interest costs of TIPS? Probably not, because the relative interest costs between TIPS and nominal Treasuries are set at the margin. We think there is some value in having a high-quality hedge to inflation risk, especially one that is available to less sophisticated investors. Improved monetary policy The second noteworthy benefit from the TIPS program is that it helps improve the conduct of monetary policy. Foremost, the program provides up-to-date information about the evolution of inflation expectations and real interest rates. Because keeping inflation expectations wellanchored is so important in keeping inflation itself in check, real-time measures of inflation expectations may lead to better monetary policymaking. This, in turn, should improve macroeconomic performance. Although this is very difficult to quantify in terms of value, I think it is safe to say that in a $NUM trillion economy, even a modest improvement in performance generates large dollar benefits. U.S. policymakers focus on a variety of inflation expectation measures, including private surveys of inflation expectations and market based measures, such as TIPS breakeven inflation rates. But in practice, the value of the survey-based measures is limited by the lack of timeliness - new data become available only DATE, DATE or DATE. Also, real money isn't riding on the accuracy of the survey responses. In contrast, the comparison between nominal Treasury and TIPS yields represents the consensus of market participants. For these reasons, policymakers rely importantly on the long-term inflation expectations proxied by the difference between nominal Treasury note and TIPS yields. So, how much is this tool worth? Of course, it is very difficult to say. Perhaps, we would flatter ourselves and think that we could do just as well without such a market-based, realtime measure of inflation expectations. But I doubt it. After all, inflation expectations, when untethered, are very difficult to re-anchor. TIPS help make it easier to keep inflation expectations in check. Improved fiscal policy The third less quantifiable benefit of TIPS is that the program may create incentives that can improve the conduct of fiscal policy. TIPS provide an explicit incentive for the fiscal authorities to conduct policy with an eye toward the consequences for inflation. The public's recognition of this incentive may help hold down inflation expectations and cause inflation expectations to be more firmly anchored. In addition, TIPS may give the Treasury access to a broader investor base, which also may reduce the Treasury's overall borrowing costs. The comparison between the prevailing interest rates on TIPS versus nominal Treasuries provides insight into the relative costs associated with issuing a marginal dollar of debt. But just as important is whether TIPS issuance, by displacing nominal Treasury issuance, reduces the level of interest rates that the Treasury pays on its nominal issuances. This would occur if TIPS were not perfect substitutes for nominal Treasury securities and if the demand for nominal Treasuries were downward sloping - that is, not completely elastic. The first condition almost certainly holds given the different attributes of TIPS versus nominal Treasuries. If they were perfect substitutes, then there would not be a liquidity premium for nominal Treasuries relative to TIPS. The second condition seems likely to hold since numerous studies have found that an increase in the net amount of Treasury borrowing leads to higher expected borrowing costs for the Treasury. How big might this effect be? That's difficult to estimate. A few studies6 have found that an increase in supply in a particular segment of the Treasury yield curve has contributed to a rise in yields. As a result, by issuing securities in a segmented TIPS market, the Treasury may keep realized yields on bill and nominal coupon securities lower than they otherwise would have been. The last noteworthy fiscal benefit from TIPS issuance is the fact that it reduces risk to the U.S. government in terms of the variability of its net financial position. The rate of inflation influences both the cost of TIPS and the government's tax receipts. Thus, some level of TIPS issuance may reduce the variability of the government's net financial position. This, in turn, should lead to a more regular and predictable pattern of issuance, which should help minimize interest costs. In summary, our analysis of the ex-ante costs of the TIPS program and the more difficult-tomeasure benefits suggests that TIPS issuance provides at least a modest net benefit to the Treasury. So, now I want to turn to a related question: Are there ways to increase the benefits? I would be willing to make two modest suggestions here. First, it may make sense to emphasize longer-dated TIPS issuance rather than shorter-dated issuance. Analytically, the logic goes as follows. Inflation uncertainty is likely to increase at longer time horizons. Thus, investors are likely to pay a greater premium for inflation protection at longer-time horizons. This implies that the cost savings associated with TIPS are likely to be greater for longer maturities rather than shorter maturities. This prediction is supported by empirical studies that have examined the premium that investors pay for inflation protection both in the United States and elsewhere. For example, a study by Brian Sack of Macroeconomic Advisors finds that forward breakeven inflation rates increase as maturity lengthens. In contrast, the level of survey-based measures of inflation expectations is quite constant beyond a time horizon of DATE. This means that the difference between forward breakeven inflation and inflation expectations climbs as the time horizon extends. This strongly suggests that the premium investors pay for inflation protection increases as maturities lengthen. Second, it may make sense to structure the TIPS program in a way that would help reduce the illiquidity premium associated with TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasuries. Some of the current illiquidity premium is likely to shrink as financial markets stabilize. However, further improvements may require a change in either the structure of the TIPS program or the secondary market trading environment. On that note, I leave you with two outstanding questions: NUM) What are the best ways for the U.S. Treasury and the trading community to improve secondary market liquidity in TIPS? NUM) Given that TIPS appear attractive for the U.S. Treasury, what is the optimal allocation of the Treasury's liability portfolio between TIPS and nominal securities? Thank you for your attention.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: The great moderation Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the meetings of the Eastern Economic Association, Washington DC, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website. One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over DATE or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility. In a recent article, Olivier Blanchard and John Simon (DATE) documented that the variability of DATE growth in real output (as measured by its standard deviation) has declined by half since DATE, while the variability of DATE inflation has declined by about two thirds.NUM Several writers on the topic have dubbed this remarkable decline in the variability of both output and inflation \"the Great Moderation\". Similar declines in the volatility of output and inflation occurred at about the same time in other major industrial countries, with the recent exception of Japan, a country that has faced a distinctive set of economic problems in DATE. Reduced macroeconomic volatility has numerous benefits. Lower volatility of inflation improves market functioning, makes economic planning easier, and reduces the resources devoted to hedging inflation risks. Lower volatility of output tends to imply more stable employment and a reduction in the extent of economic uncertainty confronting households and firms. The reduction in the volatility of output is also closely associated with the fact that recessions have become less frequent and less severe.NUM Why has macroeconomic volatility declined? Three types of explanations have been suggested for this dramatic change; for brevity, I will refer to these classes of explanations as structural change, improved macroeconomic policies, and good luck. Explanations focusing on structural change suggest that changes in economic institutions, technology, business practices, or other structural features of the economy have improved the ability of the economy to absorb shocks. Some economists have argued, for example, that improved management of business inventories, made possible by advances in computation and communication, has reduced the amplitude of fluctuations in inventory stocks, which in DATE played an important role in cyclical fluctuations.NUM The increased depth and sophistication of financial markets, deregulation in many industries, the shift away from manufacturing toward services, and increased openness to trade and international capital flows are other examples of structural changes that may have increased macroeconomic flexibility and stability. The second class of explanations focuses on the arguably improved performance of macroeconomic policies, particularly monetary policy. The historical pattern of changes in the volatilities of output growth and inflation gives some credence to the idea that better monetary policy may have been a major contributor to increased economic stability. As Blanchard and Simon (DATE) show, output volatility and inflation volatility have had a strong tendency to move together, both in the United States and other industrial countries. In particular, output volatility in the United States, at a high level in DATE, declined significantly DATE, a period in which inflation volatility was low. Both output volatility and inflation volatility rose significantly in DATE and DATE and, as I have noted, both fell sharply after DATE. Economists generally agree that DATE, the period of highest volatility in both output and inflation, was also a period in which monetary policy performed quite poorly, relative to both earlier and later periods (Romer and Romer, DATE).NUM Few disagree that monetary policy has played a large part in stabilizing inflation, and so the fact that output volatility has declined in parallel with inflation volatility, both in the United States and abroad, suggests that monetary policy may have helped moderate the variability of output as well. The third class of explanations suggests that the Great Moderation did not result primarily from changes in the structure of the economy or improvements in policymaking but occurred because the shocks hitting the economy became smaller and more infrequent. In other words, the reduction in good macroeconomic volatility we have lately enjoyed is largely the result of luck, not an intrinsically more stable economy or better policies. Several prominent studies using distinct empirical approaches have provided support for the good-luck hypothesis (Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson, DATE; Stock and Watson, DATE). Explanations of complicated phenomena are rarely clear cut and simple, and each of the three classes of explanations I have described probably contains elements of truth. Nevertheless, sorting out the relative importance of these explanations is of more than purely historical interest. Notably, if the Great Moderation was largely the result of good luck rather than a more stable economy or better policies, then we have no particular reason to expect the relatively benign economic environment of DATE to continue. Indeed, if the good-luck hypothesis is true, it is entirely possible that the variability of output growth and inflation in the United States may, at some point, return to the levels of DATE. If instead the Great Moderation was the result of structural change or improved policymaking, then the increase in stability should be more likely to persist, assuming of course that policymakers do not forget the lessons of history. My view is that improvements in monetary policy, though certainly not the only factor, have probably been an important source of the Great Moderation. In particular, I am not convinced that the decline in primarily macroeconomic volatility of DATE was the result of good luck, as some have argued, though I am sure good luck had its part to play as well. In the remainder of my remarks, I will provide some support for the \"improved-monetary-policy\" explanation for the Great Moderation. I will not spend much time on the other two classes of explanations, not because they are uninteresting or unimportant, but because my time is limited and the structural change and good-luck hypotheses have been extensively discussed elsewhere.NUM Before proceeding, I should note that my views are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. The Taylor curve and the variability tradeoff Let us begin by asking what economic theory has to say about the relationship of output volatility and inflation volatility. To keep matters simple, I will make the strong (but only temporary!) assumption that monetary policymakers have an accurate understanding of the economy and that they choose policies to promote the best economic performance possible, given their economic objectives. I also assume for the moment that the structure of the economy and the distribution of economic shocks are stable and unchanging. Under these baseline assumptions, macroeconomists have obtained an interesting and important result. Specifically, standard economic models imply that, in the long run, monetary only policymakers can reduce the volatility of inflation by allowing greater volatility in output growth, and vice versa. In other words, if monetary policies are chosen optimally and the economic structure is held constant, there exists a long-run tradeoff between volatility in output and volatility in inflation. The ultimate source of this long-run tradeoff is the existence of shocks to aggregate supply. Consider the canonical example of an aggregate supply shock, a sharp rise in oil prices caused by disruptions to foreign sources of supply. According to conventional analysis, an increase in the price of oil raises the overall price level (a temporary burst in inflation) while depressing output and employment. Monetary policymakers are therefore faced with a difficult choice. If they choose to tighten policy (raise the short-term interest rate) in order to offset the effects of the oil price shock on the general price level, they may well succeed - but only at the cost of making the decline in output more severe. Likewise, if monetary policymakers choose to ease in order to mitigate the effects of the oil price shock on output, their action will exacerbate the inflationary impact. Hence, in the standard framework, the periodic occurrence of shocks to aggregate supply (such as oil price shocks) forces policymakers to choose between stabilizing output and stabilizing inflation.NUM Note that shocks to aggregate demand do not create the same tradeoff, as offsetting an aggregate demand shock stabilizes both output and inflation. This apparent tradeoff between output variability and inflation variability faced by policymakers gives rise to what has been dubbed the Taylor curve, reflecting early work by the Stanford economist and current Undersecretary of the Treasury John B. Taylor.NUM (Taylor also originated the eponymous Taylor rule, to which I will refer later.) Graphically, the Taylor curve depicts the menu of possible combinations of output volatility and inflation volatility from which monetary policymakers can choose in the long run. Figure NUM shows two examples of Taylor curves, marked TC1 and TC2. In Figure NUM, volatility in output is measured on the vertical axis and volatility in inflation is measured on the horizontal axis. As shown in the figure, Taylor curves slope downward, reflecting the theoretical conclusion that an optimizing policymaker can choose less of one type of volatility in the long run only by accepting more of the other.NUM A direct implication of the Taylor curve framework is that a change in the preferences or objectives of the central bank alone - a decision to be tougher on inflation, for example - cannot explain the Great Moderation. Indeed, in this framework, a conscious attempt by policymakers to try to moderate the variability of inflation should lead to higher, not lower, variability of output. How, then, can the Great Moderation be explained? Figure NUM suggests two possibilities. First, suppose it were the case, contrary to what we assumed in deriving the Taylor curve, that monetary policies during the period of high macroeconomic volatility were not optimal, perhaps because policymakers did not have an accurate understanding of the structure of the economy or of the impact of their policy actions. If monetary policies during DATE and DATE were sufficiently far from optimal, the result could be a combination of output volatility and inflation volatility lying well above the efficient frontier defined by the Taylor curve. Graphically, suppose that the true Taylor curve is the solid curve shown in Figure NUM, labeled TC2. Then, in principle, sufficiently well executed policies could achieve a combination of output volatility and inflation volatility such as that represented by point B, which lies on that curve. However, less effective policies could lead to the economic outcome represented by A point in Figure NUM, at which both output volatility and inflation volatility are higher than at point B. We can see now how improvements in monetary policy might account for the Great Moderation, even in the absence of any change in the structure of the economy or in the underlying shocks. Improvements in the policy framework, in policy implementation, or in the policymakers' understanding of the economy could allow the economy to move from the inefficient point A to the efficient point B, where the volatility of both inflation and output are more moderate. Figure NUM can also be used to depict a second possible explanation for the Great Moderation, which is that, rather than monetary policy having improved, the underlying economic environment may have become more stable. Changes in the structure of the economy that increased its resilience to shocks or reductions in the variance of the shocks themselves would improve the volatility tradeoff faced by policymakers. In Figure NUM, we can imagine now that the true Taylor curve in DATE is given by the dashed curve, TC1, and the actual economic outcome chosen by policymakers is point A, which lies on TC1. Improved economic stability in DATE DATE, whether arising from structural change or good luck, can be represented by a shift of the Taylor curve from TC1 to TC2, and the new TC2 economic outcome as determined by policy is point B. Relative to TC1, the Taylor curve represents economic outcomes with lower volatility in output for any given volatility of inflation, and vice versa. According to the \"shifting Taylor curve\" explanation, the Great Moderation resulted not from improved practice of monetary policy (which has always been as effective as possible, given the environment) but rather by favorable structural change or reduced variability of economic shocks. Of and course, more complicated scenarios in which policy becomes more effective the underlying economic environment becomes more stable are possible and indeed likely. With this bit of theory as background, I will focus on two key points. First, without claiming that monetary policy during DATE or in the period since DATE has been ideal by any means, I will try to support my view that the policies of DATE and DATE were particularly inefficient, for reasons that I think we now understand. Thus, as in the first scenario just discussed (represented in Figure NUM A as a movement from point to point B), improvements in the execution of monetary policy can plausibly account for a significant part of the Great Moderation. Second, more subtly, I will argue that some of the benefits of improved monetary policy may easily be confused with changes in the underlying environment (that is, improvements in policy may be incorrectly identified as shifts in the Taylor curve), increasing the risk that standard statistical methods of analyzing this question could understate the contribution of monetary policy to the Great Moderation. Reaching the Taylor curve: improvements in the effectiveness of monetary policy Monetary policymakers face difficult challenges in their efforts to stabilize the economy. We are uncertain about many aspects of the workings of the economy, including the channels by which the effects of monetary policy are transmitted. We are even uncertain about the current economic situation as economic data are received with a lag, are typically subject to multiple revisions, and in any case can only roughly and partially depict the underlying economic reality. Thus, in practice, monetary policy will never achieve as much reduction in macroeconomic volatility as would be possible if our understanding were more complete. Nevertheless, a number of economists have argued that monetary policy during DATE and DATE was unusually prone to creating volatility, relative to both earlier and later periods (DeLong, DATE; Mayer, DATE; Romer and Romer, DATE). Economic historians have suggested that the relative inefficiency of policy during this period arose because monetary policymakers labored under some important misconceptions about policy and the economy. First, during this period, central bankers seemed to have been excessively optimistic about the ability of activist monetary policies to offset shocks to output and to deliver permanently low levels of unemployment. Second, monetary policymakers appeared to underestimate their own contributions to the inflationary problems of the time, believing instead that inflation was in large part the result of nonmonetary forces. One might say that, in terms of their ability to deliver good macroeconomic outcomes, policymakers suffered from excessive \"output optimism\" and \"inflation pessimism.\" The output optimism of DATE and DATE had several aspects. First, at least during the early part of that period, many economists and policymakers held the view that policy could exploit a permanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, as described by a simple Phillips curve relationship. The idea of a permanent tradeoff opened up the beguiling possibility that, in return for accepting just a bit more inflation, policymakers could deliver a permanently low rate of unemployment. This view is now discredited, of course, on both theoretical and empirical grounds.NUM Second, estimates of the rate of unemployment that could be sustained without igniting inflation were typically unrealistically low, with a long-term unemployment rate of NUM percent or less often being characterized as a modest and easily attainable objective.NUM Third, economists of the time may have been unduly optimistic about the ability of fiscal and monetary policymakers to eliminate short-term fluctuations in output and employment, that is, to \"fine-tune\" the economy. What I have called inflation pessimism was the increasing conviction of policymakers in DATE and DATE, as inflation rose and remained stubbornly high, that monetary policy was an ineffective tool for controlling inflation. As emphasized in recent work on the United States and the United Kingdom by Edward Nelson (DATE), during this period policymakers became more and more inclined to blame inflation on so-called cost-push shocks rather than on monetary forces. Cost-push shocks, in the paradigm of the time, included diverse factors such as union wage pressures, price increases by oligopolistic firms, and increases in the prices of commodities such as oil and beef brought about by adverse changes in supply conditions. For the purpose of understanding the upward trend in inflation, however, the most salient attribute of cost-push shocks was that they were putatively out of the control of the monetary policymakers. The combination of output optimism and inflation pessimism during the latter part of DATE and DATE was a recipe for high volatility in output and inflation - that is, a set of outcomes well away from the efficient frontier represented by the economy's Taylor curve. Notably, the belief in a long-run tradeoff between output and inflation, together with an unrealistically low assessment of the sustainable rate of unemployment, resulted in high inflation but did not deliver the expected payoff in terms of higher output and employment. Moreover, the Fed's periodic attempts to rein in surging inflation led to a pattern of \"go-stop\" policies, in which swings in policy from ease to tightness contributed to a highly volatile real economy as well as a highly variable inflation rate. Wage-price controls, invoked in the belief that monetary policy was ineffective against cost-push forces, also ultimately proved destabilizing. Monetary policymakers bemoaned the high rate of inflation in DATE but did not fully appreciate their own role in its creation. Ironically, their errors in estimating the natural rate and in ascribing inflation to nonmonetary forces were mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, because unemployment remained well above their over-optimistic estimates of the sustainable rate, they were inclined to attribute inflation to outside forces (such as the actions of firms and unions) rather than to an overheated economy (Romer and Romer, DATE; Nelson, DATE). On the other hand, the view of policymakers that exogenous forces largely drove inflation made it more difficult for them to recognize that their estimate of the sustainable rate of unemployment was too low. DATE passed before policymakers were finally persuaded by the evidence that sustained anti-inflationary monetary policies would actually work (Primiceri, DATE). As you know, these policies were implemented successfully after DATE, beginning under Fed Chairman Volcker. Better known than even the Taylor curve is John Taylor's famous Taylor rule, a simple equation that has proved remarkably useful as a rule-of-thumb description of monetary policy (Taylor, DATE). In its basic form, the Taylor rule relates the Federal Reserve's policy instrument, the overnight federal funds interest rate, to the deviations of inflation and output from the central bank's desired levels for those variables. Estimates of the Taylor rule for DATE and DATE reflect the output optimism and inflation pessimism of the period, in that researchers tend to find a weaker response of the policy rate to inflation and (in some studies) a relatively stronger response to the output gap than in more recent periods.NUM As I will shortly discuss further, an insufficiently strong response to inflation let inflation and inflation expectations get out of control and thus added volatility to the economy. At the same time, strong responses to what we understand in retrospect to have been over-optimistic estimates of the output gap created additional instability. As output optimism and inflation pessimism both waned under the force of the data, policy responses became more appropriate and the economy more stable. In this sense, improvements in policymakers' understanding of the economy and the role of monetary policy A allowed the economy to move closer to the Taylor curve (or, in terms of Figure NUM, to move from point to point B). Improved monetary policy or a shifting Taylor curve? Improvements in monetary policy that moved the economy closer to the efficient frontier described by the Taylor curve can account for part of the Great Moderation. However, several empirical studies have questioned the quantitative importance of this effect and emphasized instead shifts in the Taylor curve, brought about by structural change or good luck. For example, in a paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole conference, James Stock and Mark Watson (DATE) use several alternative macroeconomic models to simulate how the economy would have performed after DATE if monetary policy had followed its pre-DATE pattern. Although inflation performance after DATE would clearly have been worse if pre-DATE monetary policies had been used, Stock and Watson find that output volatility would have been little different. They conclude that improved monetary policy does not account for much of the reduction in output volatility since DATE. Instead, noting that the variance of the economic shocks implied by their models for DATE was much higher than the variance of shocks in the more recent period, they embrace the good-luck explanation of the Great Moderation. Interesting research by Timothy Cogley and Thomas Sargent (DATE) and by Shaghil Ahmed, Andrew Levin, and Beth Anne Wilson (DATE) likewise find a substantial reduction in the size and frequency of shocks in the more recent period, supporting the good-luck hypothesis. Both the structural change and good-luck explanations of the Great Moderation are intriguing and (to reiterate) both are no doubt part of the story. However, an unsatisfying aspect of both explanations is the difficulty of identifying changes in the economic environment large enough and persistent enough to explain the Great Moderation, both in the United States and abroad. In particular, it is not obvious that economic shocks have become significantly smaller or more infrequent, as required by the goodluck hypothesis. Tensions in the Middle East, often blamed for the oil price shocks of DATE, have hardly declined in DATE, and important developments in technology and productivity have continued to buffet the economy (albeit in a more positive direction than in DATE). Nor has the international economic environment become obviously more placid, as a series of financial crises struck various regions of the world during the DATE and the powerful forces of globalization have proceeded apace. In contrast, following the adverse experience of DATE, changes in the practice of monetary policy occurred around the world in similar ways and during DATE. Certainly, stability-enhancing changes in the economic environment have occurred in DATE. However, an intriguing possibility is that some of these changes, rather than being truly exogenous, may have been induced by improved monetary policies. That is, better monetary policies may have resulted in what appear to be (but only appear to be) favorable shifts in the economy's Taylor curve. Here are some examples of what I have in mind. First, monetary policies that brought down and stabilized inflation may have led to stabilizing changes in the structure of the economy as well, in line with the prediction of the famous Lucas (DATE) critique that economic structure depends on the policy regime. High and unstable inflation increases the variability of relative prices and real interest rates, for example, distorting decisions regarding consumption, capital investment, and inventory investment, among others. Likewise, the high level, variability, and unpredictability of inflation profoundly affected decisions regarding financial investments and money holdings. Theories of \"rational inattention\" (Sims, DATE), according to which people vary the frequency with which they re-examine economic decisions according to the underlying economic environment, imply that the dynamic behavior of the economy would change - probably in the direction of greater stability and persistence - in a more stable pricing environment, in which people reconsider their economic decisions less frequently. Second, changes in monetary policy could conceivably affect the size and frequency of shocks hitting the economy, at least as an econometrician would measure those shocks. This assertion seems odd at first, as we are used to thinking of shocks as exogenous events, arising from \"outside the model,\" so to speak. However, econometricians typically do not measure shocks directly but instead infer them from movements in macroeconomic variables that they cannot otherwise explain. Shocks in this sense may certainly reflect the monetary regime. For example, consider the cost-push shocks that played such an important role in DATE' thinking about inflation. Seemingly unexplained or autonomous movements in wages and prices during this period, which analysts would have interpreted as shocks to wage and price equations, may in fact have been the result of earlier monetary policy actions, or (more subtly) of monetary policy actions expected by wage- and price-setters to take place in the future. In an influential paper, Robert Barsky and Lutz Kilian (DATE) analyze the oil price shocks of DATE in this spirit. Barsky and Kilian provide evidence that the extraordinary increases in nominal oil prices during DATE were made feasible primarily by earlier expansionary monetary policies rather than by truly exogenous political or economic events. Third, monetary policy can also affect the distribution of measured shocks by changing the sensitivity of pricing and other economic decisions to exogenous outside events. For example, significant movements in the price of oil and other commodities continued to occur after DATE. However, in a low-inflation environment, with stable inflation expectations and a general perception that firms do not have pricing power, commodity price shocks are not passed into final goods prices to nearly the same degree as in a looser monetary environment. As a result, a change in commodity prices of a given size shows up as a smaller shock to output and consumer prices DATE than it would have in the earlier period. Likewise, there is evidence that fluctuations in exchange rates have smaller effects on domestic prices and economic activity when inflation is less volatile and inflation expectations are stabilized (Gagnon and Ihrig, DATE; Devereux, Engel, and Storgaard, DATE). Fourth, changes in inflation expectations, which are ultimately the product of the monetary policy regime, can also be confused with truly exogenous shocks in conventional econometric analyses. Marvin Goodfriend (DATE) has suggested, for example, that insufficiently anchored inflation expectations have led to periodic \"inflation scares\", in which inflation expectations have risen in an apparently autonomous manner. Increases in inflation expectations have the flavor of adverse aggregate supply shocks in that they tend to increase the volatility of both inflation and output, in a combination that depends on how strongly the monetary policymakers act to offset these changes in expectations. Theoretical and empirical support for the idea that inflation expectations may become an independent source of instability has grown in DATE.NUM As I mentioned earlier, a number of researchers have found that the reaction of monetary policymakers to inflation has strengthened, in that the estimated coefficient on inflation in the Taylor rule has risen from something less than NUM before DATE to a value significantly greater than NUM in the more recent period. If the policy interest rate responds to increases in inflation by less than one-for-one (so that the real policy rate does not rise in the face of higher inflation), economic theory tells us that inflation expectations and the economy in general can become unstable. The problem arises from the fact that, if policymakers do not react sufficiently aggressively to increases in inflation, spontaneously arising expectations of increased inflation can ultimately be selfconfirming and even self-reinforcing. Incidentally, the stability requirement that the policy rate respond to inflation by more than one-for-one is called the Taylor principle (Taylor, DATE, DATE) - the third concept named after John Taylor that has played a role in this talk. The finding that monetary policymakers violated the Taylor principle during DATE but satisfied the principle in DATE would be consistent with a reduced incidence of destabilizing expectational shocks.NUM Support for the view that inflation expectations can be an independent source of economic volatility has also emerged from the extensive recent literature on learning and macroeconomics (Evans and Honkopohja, DATE). For example, Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (DATEa, DATEb) have studied models in which the public must learn the central bank's underlying preferences regarding inflation by observing the actual inflation process.NUM With learning, inflation expectations take on a more adaptive character; in particular, high and unstable inflation will beget similar characteristics in the pattern of inflation expectations. As Orphanides and Williams show, when inflation expectations are poorly anchored, so that the public is highly uncertain about the long-run rate of inflation that the central bank hopes to achieve, they can become an additional source of volatility in the economy. An analysis that did not properly control for the expectational effects of changes in monetary policy might incorrectly conclude that the Taylor curve had shifted in an adverse direction. Conclusion The Great Moderation, the substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility over DATE, is a striking economic development. Whether the dominant cause of the Great Moderation is structural change, improved monetary policy, or simply good luck is an important question about which no consensus has yet formed. I have argued DATE that improved monetary policy has likely made an important contribution not only to the reduced volatility of inflation (which is not particularly controversial) but to the reduced volatility of output as well. Moreover, because a change in the monetary policy regime has pervasive effects, I have suggested that some of the effects of improved monetary policies may have been misidentified as exogenous changes in economic structure or in the distribution of economic shocks. This conclusion on my part makes me optimistic for the future, because I am confident that monetary policymakers will not forget the lessons of DATE. I have put my case for better monetary policy rather forcefully DATE, because I think it likely that the policy explanation for the Great Moderation deserves more credit than it has received in the literature. However, let me close by emphasizing that the debate remains very much open. Although I have focused on its strengths, the monetary policy hypothesis has potential deficiencies as well. For example, although I pointed out the difficulty that the structural change and good-luck explanations have in accounting for the rather sharp decline in volatility after DATE, one might also question whether the change in monetary",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: What policymakers can learn from asset prices Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before The Investment Analysts Society of Chicago, Chicago, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    Central bankers naturally pay close attention to interest rates and asset prices, in large part because these variables are the principal conduits through which monetary policy affects real activity and inflation. But policymakers watch financial markets carefully for another reason, which is that asset prices and yields are potentially valuable sources of timely information about economic and financial conditions. Because the future returns on most financial assets depend sensitively on economic conditions, asset prices - if determined in sufficiently liquid markets - should embody a great deal of investors' collective information and beliefs about the future course of the economy. I thought you might find it interesting to hear a bit about how the staff of the Federal Reserve uses financial-market information to try to improve forecasts and help guide policy decisions. As you will see, asset prices provide information, particularly about market expectations, that is difficult to obtain elsewhere. However, a recurring theme of my remarks will be that extracting accurate information from asset prices and yields is more difficult and requires greater sophistication than is commonly supposed. Ongoing research in financial economics thus has great potential to provide practical assistance to monetary policy makers. As usual, the views I will express DATE are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.NUM Market expectations of inflation: the information in inflation-indexed securities I will begin by discussing what financial markets can tell us about inflation expectations. The inflation expectations of financial-market participants are of particular interest to central bankers, for several reasons. First, as price stability is a key objective of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve puts substantial resources into forecasting inflation. To the extent that financial markets serve to aggregate private-sector information about the likely future course of inflation, data on asset prices and yields might be used to validate and perhaps improve the Fed's forecasts. Second, inflation expectations are of interest to policymakers independent of inflation itself. A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or \"anchor,\" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, DATE; Evans and Honkapohja, DATE). Finally, knowledge of the expectations of inflation in financial markets permits the calculation of real interest rates, which are important indicators of both the condition of the economy and the stance of monetary policy. Although clues about inflation expectations abound in financial markets, inflation-indexed securities would appear to be the most direct source of information about inflation expectations and real interest rates.NUM Government securities whose realized yields depend on inflation, known on the Street as \"linkers,\" have become increasingly common in industrial countries, Japan being the latest nation to introduce an inflation-indexed government bond. The U.S. Treasury began issuing TIIS (for Treasury inflation-indexed securities), more popularly known as TIPS (for Treasury inflation-protected securities), in DATE. TIPS promise a yield-to-maturity that is guaranteed in real terms. To provide the promised real yield, TIPS coupon and principal payments are escalated based on increases in the consumer price index from the time at which the security was issued. The difference between the real yield guaranteed by an inflation-linked security and the nominal yield provided by a conventional security of the same maturity is known as the breakeven inflation rate or, alternatively, as inflation compensation. The top panel of Figure NUM shows the yield on nominal DATE Treasury bonds (top line) and the real yield on DATE TIPS since DATE (bottom line). The vertical distance between the two lines is known as breakeven inflation at the DATE horizon. The bottom panel uses overlapping issues of nominal securities and TIPS to disaggregate breakeven inflation into the rate that applies to bonds maturing DATE and the implied forward breakeven rate from DATE out. The breakeven rate of inflation is often treated as a direct reading of investors' expectations of inflation. Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of Figure NUM is an estimate of market inflation expectations over DATE, and the upper line represents DATE forward expectations of inflation, that is, DATE's expectation of what average inflation will be DATE. Unfortunately, as a measure of market participants' expected inflation, breakeven inflation has a number of problems (Sack, DATE; Shen and Corning, DATE). First, and probably the most important, breakeven inflation includes a return to investors for bearing inflation risk, implying that the breakeven rate likely overstates the market's expected rate of inflation. Estimates of the inflation risk premium for bonds maturing during the next DATE are surprisingly large, generally in a range between NUM and NUM basis points, depending on the time period studied (Ang and Bekaert, DATE; Goto and Torous, DATE; Buraschi and Jiltsov, DATE). If the inflation risk premium averages NUM basis points, for example, then breakeven inflation will overstate the market's true expectation of inflation by half a percentage point, a substantial amount. A further complication is that inflation risk premiums are not constant but instead appear to vary over time as economic circumstances change. Second, although the issuance of inflation-protected securities has risen significantly, the outstanding quantities of these securities remain much smaller than those of conventional Treasury securities. Moreover, TIPS are attractive to buy-and-hold investors, in contrast to nominal Treasury securities, which are extensively used for trading and hedging (Sack and Elsasser, DATE). For both reasons, the market for TIPS remains significantly less liquid than those for most Treasury securities. All else equal, the likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an underestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk premium.NUM Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further complicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation. A third issue is that the real values of the coupon payments on an indexed security are fixed by construction, while the real coupons of a nominal bond usually decline over its life. Hence, an indexed security typically has a longer duration with respect to real interest rate changes than does the nominal security, a difference that affects the relative riskiness of real and nominal securities.NUM More generally, because TIPS returns are imperfectly correlated with the yields on both nominal Treasuries and stocks, some investors demand TIPS for general diversification purposes - a demand that appears to have increased significantly as investors have become more familiar with this new type of asset. As the supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may push down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation.NUM A separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS returns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers are more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices. In fact, TIPS returns appear sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. NUM As a partial fix of this problem, the breakeven inflation rates shown in Figure NUM are calculated by comparing the yields of TIPS and so-called off-the-run securities. Within a given class of securities, say Treasury bonds with DATE until maturity, off-the-run securities are securities other than those most recently issued. Because off-the-run securities are less liquid than newly issued (on-the-run) securities, they provide a more appropriate benchmark against which to compare the yields of relatively illiquid inflation-indexed bonds. NUM As Sack (DATE) has pointed out, this difference in duration implies that the breakeven inflation rate may be sensitive to the expected profile of future short real rates or be affected by differences in risk premiums arising from different exposure to interest-rate risk. Sack addressed the issue of differing durations of nominal securities and TIPS by comparing yields on TIPS to yields on artificial securities constructed to provide the same pattern of real payments as a TIPS security, thereby eliminating the differences in duration noted in the text. He found, however, that the duration mismatch is less important quantitatively than differences in liquidity between on-the-run nominal securities and TIPS. NUM A number of technical issues, such as the lags in the inflation adjustment procedure, affect the relationship of breakeven inflation and expected inflation. One such potential complication arises if the tax rates applicable to the marginal TIPS investor and to the marginal holder of nominal government securities are not the same, in which case the equilibrium breakeven inflation level will be affected. Roll (DATE) discusses the effects of taxation on the breakeven inflation rate. BIS Review NUM/DATE As you can see in Figure NUM, breakeven inflation rates have proven surprisingly volatile over their short history. For example, when nominal Treasury yields swung sharply during DATE summer of DATE, DATE breakeven inflation moved sharply as well, declining about NUM basis points as the bond market rallied, then rising about NUM basis points when nominal yields came back up (top panel). This effect was seen also in inflation compensation at the five-to-DATE horizon (bottom panel), a rather counterintuitive result. What should we make of the volatility of breakeven inflation over DATE? One interpretation is that inflation expectations are not as well anchored as policymakers would like (see Bernanke, DATE, for additional evidence on this point). The fact that inflation compensation tends to react strongly both to releases of macroeconomic data and to unexpected changes in monetary policy (Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, DATE) supports this interpretation. Still, at this point I think we need to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions about the short-run behavior of expected inflation from the data on breakeven inflation. The fact that the volatility of breakeven inflation is so much greater than that of standard survey measures of inflation expectations (such as those collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for professional forecasters or by the University of Michigan for consumers) should give us pause. The responsiveness of breakeven inflation to what might be construed primarily as liquidity disturbances, such as the Russian debt crisis and recent bouts of mortgage hedging activity that roiled Treasury markets, suggests that variable liquidity premiums, together with varying inflation risk premiums, contaminate breakeven inflation as a measure of expected inflation.NUM I have emphasized some reasons to be cautious in interpreting breakeven inflation as expected inflation. Nevertheless, I expect that the usefulness of inflation-indexed securities as a tool for measuring expected inflation will increase over time. The liquidity of TIPS should continue to improve as the share of government debt issued in inflation-linked form continues to rise, particularly if the Treasury decides to expand the range of maturities of indexed bonds that it offers. Moreover, as I will discuss briefly later in the talk, our ability to model risk and liquidity premiums is improving, which will help us control for an important source of volatility in breakeven inflation. Finally, the universe of inflation-linked financial assets seems to be increasing, which will allow for fruitful comparisons and cross-checking. For example, futures on the CPI were recently introduced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Although these contracts are not yet widely traded, they may at some point provide useful measures of breakeven inflation out to the maturity of the shortest-term TIPS, thereby filling in an important portion of the term structure of breakeven inflation. Interest rates and spreads as leading indicators An alternative approach to extracting information from financial markets is to examine a range of asset prices and yields to determine whether they are useful as leading indicators of economic developments. Financial prices meet several key criteria for being useful leading indicators. As I already noted, asset prices and yields are inherently forward looking and thus may contain information about future economic conditions not evident in other series. Moreover, asset prices, unlike many data series, are available on a timely and continuous basis and are not revised. At least since DATE, when Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns (DATE) published their pioneering work, economists have noted the usefulness of asset prices in forecasting economic activity - though perhaps we should keep in mind Paul Samuelson's wry observation that \"the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions.\" Although many financial quantities have been used in forecasting (an index of stock prices is included in the official index of leading indicators), interest rates on various financial instruments have perhaps been most often cited for their value as leading indicators.NUM For example, in a DATE paper, Alan Blinder and I found evidence that the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate used by the Federal Reserve as its policy instrument, has significant predictive power for a variety of measures of economic activity. Various yield spreads have also been found to be informative about the future course of the economy. In DATE, James Stock and Mark Watson proposed a new index of leading indicators based on seven variables with exceptionally good forecasting track records up to that date. Among these variables were the spread between the DATE and DATE Treasury yields (the term spread), the yield differential between commercial paper and Treasury bills (the public-private spread), the change in the DATE Treasury yields, and the nominal exchange rate.NUM Thus, Stock and Watson found that two of the best seven macroeconomic forecasting variables were interest rate spreads, and four of the best seven forecasters were financial in nature. Of these variables, the term spread (also known as the slope of the yield curve) had been recognized for some time as a useful indicator of cyclical conditions. Figure NUM shows the historical behavior of the term spread (top panel, here measured as the DATE rate less the DATE rate), as well as that of the federal funds rate and the spread between commercial paper and DATE T-bill yields for comparison. The shaded areas indicate periods of recession as designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It is interesting that the slope of the Treasury yield curve has turned negative (top panel), at least briefly, at DATE before every U.S. recession since DATE (Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei, DATE). It has given only one false signal, in DATE, when an economic slowdown - but not an official recession - followed the inversion of the yield curve. The slope of the yield curve is potentially informative for several reasons. To some extent, it captures the stance of monetary policy. For example, when the yield curve is sharply upward sloping, as is the case DATE, one can usually conclude that monetary policy is in an expansionary mode (because the short-term policy rate lies below the average of expected future short-term rates). Either an expected pickup in economic growth or higher expected future inflation would also tend to raise long-term rates relative to short rates, steepening the yield curve. Evidence for the predictive power of the slope of the yield curve has been found for other industrialized countries as well as for the United States.NUM Although the evident information content of the term spread and other yields and spreads is intriguing, these variables - like breakeven inflation - hardly provide a foolproof forecasting tool. For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the DATE recession very weakly and rather late. The yield curve was inverted from June DATE through March DATE, which presaged the DATE recession, but other financial indicators (such as the public-private spread) missed the downturn entirely (Stock and Watson, DATEa), as you can see in Figure NUM. More generally, Stock and Watson (DATEb) have recently documented that simple forecasting relationships are typically quite unstable, presumably because both the nation's economic structure, the conduct of policy, and the mix of shocks that buffet the economy change over time. Although the use of financial data as leading indicators is not without risks, I suspect that economists will continue to try to find better ways to extract the information in these data. I see two general approaches as being especially promising. First, forecasting relationships that simultaneously use information from a large number of data series may be more robust than prediction equations based on only a few variables (Stock and Watson, DATEb). One effective way to summarize the information in large data sets is through the estimation of statistical models that extract the common information conveyed by many variables.NUM Currently, the U.S. Treasury uses a model of this type in preparing its forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP), and the Chicago Fed's national activity index, which draws on earlier work by Stock and Watson, is also based on these methods. The Board staff is currently investigating the potential of this approach for forecasting the economy. The other promising approach is to combine financial and macroeconomic information in a more structured way. For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (DATE) have used modern financial theory to construct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key interest rates. In particular, their framework incorporates the possibility of two-way causality, allowing for both interest-rate effects on the economy and the impact of economic developments on interest rates. These authors show that combining financial and macroeconomic elements in a single model permits better forecasts of both GDP and of interest rates than can be achieved through less formal methods.NUM Other work, for example by Ang and Bekaert (DATE), shows how modeling the links between interest rates and the economy may help us obtain more efficient forecasts of inflation. These methods are also being studied at the Federal Reserve Board. One important advantage of this theory-based modeling approach is that it permits the estimation of risk premiums. For example, presumably the predictive power of the term spread would be enhanced if we could separate changes in the spread resulting from changes in rate expectations from those arising from changes in risk premiums. Similarly, better estimates of inflation risk premiums would prove useful for adjusting breakeven inflation rates from TIPS to get more reliable measures of expected inflation. Market expectations of monetary policy What do markets expect about the future course of monetary policy? The question is important to policymakers, not because we are concerned necessarily that we should meet the market's expectations - such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors - but as a check on the efficacy of our communication. If the policy expectations of the market differ significantly from the policy expectations of central bankers, then the two leading possibilities are, first, that the policy committee has not accurately communicated its outlook and objectives or, second, that the market hears the policy committee's message but is skeptical of it. A number of financial instruments provide readings on the market's policy expectations. Two of the most useful are federal funds futures contracts and eurodollar futures contracts. These contracts are traded in highly liquid markets.NUM Moreover, by their nature they are closely tied to expectations of monetary policy changes, as both reflect rates paid in the interbank market, the market that is targeted by the Federal Reserve's open-market operations.NUM Implied forward values of short-term interest rates at various horizons can be extracted from federal funds and eurodollar futures contract prices in a straightforward way. Figure NUM provides an illustration. The lower, dashed line shows the path of the expected federal funds rate through DATE as implied by federal funds and eurodollar futures at the close of the market on April NUM, DATE, with an adjustment for the average level of term premiums. The upper, solid line shows the path of expected funds rates as of the market close on DATE, DATE. As you probably know, the payroll employment numbers announced on DATE significantly exceeded market expectations. Figure NUM shows that the payroll data seems to have caused the market to price in an expectation of a higher federal funds rate target over the entire policy horizon. Of course, that change in policy expectations is consistent with the significant rise in Treasury yields that occurred after the employment report. Observing market expectations of policy provides useful feedback to the policymakers. Yet again, however, caution is needed in interpreting these data. As with inflation-indexed securities, forward interest rates implied by futures contracts do not necessarily correspond to market expectations of the short-term rate, because of the presence of premiums for interest-rate risk.NUM Indeed, research suggests that risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures contracts are not trivial and may vary over time. For example, a study by Piazzesi and Swanson (DATE) has found that risk premiums on federal funds futures are both strongly countercyclical and predictable at longer horizons. The implication is that, although futures prices provide good estimates of market expectations of policy at short horizons of DATE, at longer horizons they can be misleading. In particular, Piazzesi and Swanson (DATE) find that if analysts ignore risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures, they will estimate longer-horizon policy expectations that \"lag behind\" actual market expectations, remaining too high when the Fed is easing and too low when the Fed is tightening.NUM Fortunately, this research also shows how to correct the futures data to account for the time variation in risk premiums. Once again, we see that some subtlety is required to extract the information available in asset prices. A great advantage of market-based measures of policy expectations, relative to periodic surveys that ask market participants about their expectations, is that market measures are available essentially continuously.NUM These measures thus lend themselves to \"event studies\" of two types, both of which are employed at the Board of Governors. The first type analyzes how various events, such as Federal Reserve statements; the release of TIME, testimony, or speeches by members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC); and macroeconomic news affect market expectations of monetary policy. One simply compares the implied policy expectations before and after the event being studied. We have already considered an example, the effects of the most recent payroll report, in Figure NUM. Analyses of this type provide insights for policymakers into the question of what economic factors the \"market,\" viewed collectively, is focusing on at a given time. The second type of event study uses market-based measures of policy expectations to analyze the effects of policy changes on the economy. In particular, when the FOMC chooses to set the target for the federal funds rate at a value different from that expected by the market, asset prices tend to react strongly. For example, in a recent paper, Kenneth Kuttner and I (DATE) studied the effects on stock prices of unanticipated changes in monetary policy, as measured by settings of the federal funds rate target that differ from those implied by federal funds futures market. We found that a surprise increase of NUM basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about NUM percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect on stock prices.NUM Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission. Policymakers are concerned not only about market expectations of output, inflation, interest rates, and other key variables, but also about the extent of market uncertainty about those and other variables. Financial data provide insight about market uncertainty that is obtainable nowhere else. For example, the Board's staff regularly analyzes the prices of options on eurodollar futures to estimate the degree of uncertainty that market participants have about monetary policy at different horizons. Indeed, by examining options with different strike prices, and under some reasonable additional assumptions, one can produce a full probability distribution of market expectations for the level of the federal funds rate at various dates in the future. Likewise, analysis of various types of options can generate distributions of expectations for economic and financial variables ranging from oil prices to the exchange value of the dollar to future stock prices.NUM Conclusion Financial markets aggregate enormous amounts of information and thus provide a rich hunting ground for central bankers trying to learn about the economy. Today I have tried to provide a small taste of the many types of financial data that are analyzed by the staff at the Federal Reserve as well as to give you some sense of the techniques that they bring to bear. A message that I also hope to leave with you is that some of the potentially most valuable information in financial markets often requires considerable theoretical and empirical sophistication to extract. For this reason, and as I mentioned at the beginning, financial research of the type being conducted at the Board, in academia, and in the investment community will prove invaluable to the Federal Reserve in our efforts to support a stronger and more stable economy.

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Panel discussion: what have we learned since DATE? Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the Conference on Reflections on Monetary Policy DATE after DATE, Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, St Louis, Missouri, DATE. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's website.    The question asked of this panel is, \"What have we learned since DATE?\" The evidence suggests that we have learned quite a bit. Most notably, monetary policy-makers, political leaders, and the public have been persuaded by DATE of experience that low and stable inflation has very substantial economic benefits. This consensus marks a considerable change from the views held by many economists at the time that Paul Volcker became Fed Chairman. In DATE, most economists would have agreed that, in principle, low inflation promotes economic growth and efficiency in the long run. However, many also believed that, in the range of inflation rates typically experienced by industrial countries, the benefits of low inflation are probably small - particularly when set against the short-run costs of a major disinflation, as the United States faced at that time. Indeed, some economists would have held that low-inflation policies would likely prove counterproductive even in the long run, if an increased focus on inflation inhibited monetary policy-makers from responding adequately to fluctuations in economic activity and employment. As it turned out, the low-inflation era of the past DATE has seen not only significant improvements in economic growth and productivity but also a marked reduction in economic volatility, both in the United States and abroad, a phenomenon that has been dubbed \"the Great Moderation.\" Recessions have become less frequent and milder, and DATE volatility in output and employment has declined significantly as well. The sources of the Great Moderation remain somewhat controversial, but as I have argued elsewhere, there is evidence for the view that improved control of inflation has contributed in important measure to this welcome change in the economy (Bernanke, DATE). Paul Volcker and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee deserve enormous credit both for recognizing the crucial importance of achieving low and stable inflation and for the courage and perseverance with which they tackled America's critical inflation problem. I could say much more about Volcker's achievement and its lasting benefits, but I am sure that many other speakers will cover that ground. Instead, in my remaining time, I will focus on some lessons that economists have drawn from the Volcker regime regarding the importance of credibility in central banking and how that credibility can be obtained. As usual, the views I will express are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. Volcker could not have accomplished what he did, of course, had he not been appointed to the chairmanship by President Jimmy Carter. In retrospect, however, Carter's appointment decision seems at least a bit incongruous. Why would the President appoint as head of the central bank an individual whose economic views and policy goals (not to mention personal style) seemed, at least on the surface, quite different from his own? However, not long into Volcker's term, a staff economist at the Board of Governors produced a paper that explained why Carter's decision may in fact have been quite sensible from the President's, and indeed the society's, point of view. Although the question seems a narrow one, the insights of the paper had far broader application; indeed, this research has substantially advanced our understanding of the links among central bank credibility, central bank structure, and the effectiveness of monetary policy. Insiders will have already guessed that the Board economist to whom I refer is Kenneth Rogoff, currently a professor of economics at Harvard, and that the paper in question is Ken's DATE article, \"The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an Intermediate Monetary Target\" (Rogoff, DATE).NUM The insights of the Rogoff paper are well worth recalling DATE. Rather than considering the paper in isolation, however, I will place it in the context of two other classic papers on credibility and central bank design, an earlier work by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott and a later piece by Carl Walsh. As I proceed, I will note what I see to be the important lessons and the practical implications of this line of research.NUM Central bankers have long recognized at some level that the credibility of their pronouncements matters. I think it is fair to say, however, that in DATE and DATE, as the U.S. inflation crisis was building, economists and policymakers did not fully understand or appreciate the determinants of credibility and its link to policy outcomes. In DATE, however, Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott published a classic paper, entitled \"Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans\" (Kydland and Prescott, DATE), that provided the first modern analysis of these issues.NUM Specifically, Kydland and Prescott demonstrated why, in many situations, economic outcomes will be better if policymakers are able to make credible commitments, or promises, about certain aspects of the policies they will follow in the future. \"Credible\" in this context means that the public believes that the policymakers will keep their promises, even if they face incentives to renege. In particular, as one of Kydland and Prescott's examples illustrates, monetary policy-makers will generally find it advantageous to commit publicly to following policies that will produce low inflation. If the policymakers' statements are believed (that is, if they are credible), then the public will expect inflation to be low, and demands for wage and price increases should accordingly be moderate. In a virtuous circle, this cooperative behavior by the public makes the central bank's commitment to low inflation easier to fulfill. In contrast, if the public is skeptical of the central bank's commitment to low inflation (for example, if it believes that the central bank may give in to the temptation to overstimulate the economy for the sake of short-term employment gains), then the public's inflation expectations will be higher than they otherwise would be. Expectations of high inflation lead to more-aggressive wage and price demands, which make achieving and maintaining low inflation more difficult and costly (in terms of lost output and employment) for the central bank. Providing a clear explanation of why credibility is important for effective policymaking, as Kydland and Prescott did, was an important step. However, these authors largely left open the critical issue of how a central bank is supposed to obtain credibility in the first place. Here is where Rogoff's seminal article took up the thread.NUM Motivated by the example of Carter and Volcker, Rogoff's paper showed analytically why even a president who is not particularly averse to inflation, or at least no more so than the average member of the general public, might find it in his interest to appoint a well-known \"inflation hawk\" to head the central bank. The benefit of appointing a hawkish central banker is the increased inflation-fighting credibility that such an appointment brings. The public is certainly more likely to believe an inflation hawk when he promises to contain inflation because they understand that, as someone who is intrinsically averse to inflation, he is unlikely to renege on his commitment. As increased credibility allows the central bank to achieve low inflation at a smaller cost than a non-credible central bank can, the president may well find, somewhat paradoxically, that he prefers the economic outcomes achieved under the hawkish central banker to those that could have been obtained under a central banker with views closer to his own and those of the public. NUM In focusing on three landmark papers I necessarily ignore what has become an enormous literature on credibility and monetary policy. Walsh (DATE, chap. NUM) provides an excellent overview. Rogoff (DATE) was an important early survey of the \"first generation\" of models of credibility in the context of central banking. NUM In another noteworthy paper, Calvo (DATE) made a number of points similar to those developed by Kydland and Prescott. The extension of the Kydland-Prescott \"inflation bias\" by Barro and Gordon (1983a) has proved highly influential. NUM Rogoff was my graduate school classmate at M.I.T., and I recently asked him for his recollections about the origins of the conservative central banker. Here (from a personal e-mail) is part of his response: [T]he paper was mainly written at the Board in DATE . . . It came out as an IMF working paper in DATE (I was visiting there), and then the same version came out as an International Finance Discussion paper [at the Board of Governors] in DATE . . . The original version of the paper . . . featured inflation targeting. Much like the published paper, I suggested that having an independent central bank can be a solution to the time consistency [that is, credibility] problem if we give the bank an intermediate target and some (unspecified) incentive to hit the target . . . I had the conservative central banker idea in there as well, as one practical way to ensure the central bank placed a high weight on inflation. Larry Summers, my editor at the [Quarterly Journal of Economics], urged me to move that idea up to the front section and place inflation targeting second. This, of course, is how the paper ended up. [Regarding the Fed], Dale Henderson and Matt Canzoneri liked the paper very much . . . many other researchers gave me feedback on my paper (including Peter Tinsley, Ed Offenbacher, Bob Flood, Jo Anna Gray, and many others) . . . Last but perhaps most important, there is absolutely no doubt that the paper was inspired by my experience watching the Volcker Fed at close range. I never would have written it had I not . . . ended up as an economist at the Board. BIS Review NUM/DATE Appointing an inflation hawk to head the central bank may not be enough to ensure credibility for monetary policy, however. As Rogoff noted in his article, for this strategy to confer significant credibility benefits, the central bank must be perceived by the public as being sufficiently independent from the rest of the government to be immune to short-term political pressures. Thus Rogoff's proposed strategy was really two-pronged: The appointment of inflation-averse central bankers must be combined with measures to ensure central bank independence. These ideas, supported by a great deal of empirical work, have proven highly influential.NUM Indeed, the credibility benefits of central bank autonomy have been widely recognized in DATE, not only in the academic literature but, far more consequentially, in the real-world design of central banking institutions. For example, in the United Kingdom, the euro area, Japan, and numerous other places, recent legislation or other government action has palpably strengthened the independence of the central banks.NUM Rogoff's proposed solution to the credibility problems of central banks does have some limitations, however, as Ken recognized both in his paper and in subsequent work. First, although an inflation-averse central banker enhances credibility and delivers lower inflation on average, he may not respond to shocks to the economy in the socially desirable way. For example, faced with an aggregate supply shock (such as a sharp rise in oil prices), an inflation-averse central banker will tend to react too aggressively (from society's point of view) to contain the inflationary impact of the shock, with insufficient attention to the consequences of his policy for output and employment.NUM Second, contrary to an assumption of Rogoff's paper, in practice the policy preferences of a newly appointed central banker will not be precisely known by the public but must be inferred from policy actions. (Certainly the public's perceptions of Chairman Volcker's views and objectives evolved over time.) Knowing that the public must make such inferences might tempt a central banker to misrepresent the state of the economy (Canzoneri, DATE) or even to take suboptimal policy decisions; for example, the central banker may feel compelled to tighten policy more aggressively than is warranted in order to convince the public of his determination to fight inflation. The public's need to infer the central banker's policy preferences may even generate increased economic instability, as has been shown in a lively recent literature on the macroeconomic consequences of learning.NUM The third pathbreaking paper I will mention DATE, a DATE article by Carl Walsh entitled \"Optimal Contracts for Central Bankers,\" was an attempt to address both of these issues.NUM To do so, Walsh conducted a thought experiment. He asked his readers to imagine that the government or society could offer the head of the central bank a performance contract, one that includes explicit monetary rewards or penalties that depend on the economic outcomes that occur under his watch. Remarkably, Walsh showed that, in principle, a relatively simple contract between the government and the central bank would lead to the implementation of monetary policies that would be both credible and fully optimal. Under this contract, the government provides the central banker with a base level of compensation but then applies a penalty that depends on the realized rate of inflation - the higher the observed inflation rate, the greater the penalty. If the public understands the nature of the contract, and if the penalty assessed for permitting inflation is large enough to affect central bank behavior, the existence of the contract would give credence to NUM Walsh (DATE, section NUM) reviews empirical research on the correlations of central bank independence and economic outcomes. A consistent finding is that more-independent central banks produce lower inflation without any increase in output volatility. NUM The benefits of central bank independence should not lead us to ignore its downside, which is that the very distance from the political process that increases the central bank's policy credibility by necessity also risks isolating the central bank and making it less democratically accountable. For this reason, central bankers should make communication with the public and their elected representatives a high priority. Moreover, central bank independence does not imply that central banks should never coordinate with other parts of the government, under the appropriate circumstances. NUM Lohmann (DATE) shows that this problem can be ameliorated if the government limits the central bank's independence, stepping in to override the central bank's decisions when the supply shock becomes too large. However, to preserve the central bank's independence in normal situations, this approach would involve stating clearly in advance the conditions under which the government would intercede, which may not be practicable. NUM Evans and Honkopohja (DATE) is the standard reference on learning in macroeconomics. Recent papers that apply models of learning to the analysis of U.S. monetary policy include Erceg and Levin (DATE) and Orphanides and Williams (forthcoming). NUM Persson and Tabellini (DATE) provided an influential analysis of the contracting approach that extended and developed many of the points made by Walsh (DATE). BIS Review NUM/DATE central bank promises to keep the inflation rate low (that is, the contract would provide credibility).NUM Walsh's contract has in common with Rogoff's approach the idea that, in a world of imperfect credibility, giving the central banker an objective function that differs from the true objectives of society may be useful. However, Walsh also shows that the contracting approach ameliorates the two problems associated with Rogoff's approach. First, under the Walsh contract, the central banker has incentives not only to achieve the target rate of inflation but also to respond in the socially optimal manner to supply shocks.NUM Second, as the inflation objective and the central banker's incentive scheme are made explicit by the contract, the public's problem of inferring the central banker's policy preferences is significantly reduced. There have been a few attempts in the real world to implement an incentive contract for central bankers - most famously a plan proposed to the New Zealand legislature, though never adopted, which provided for firing the governor of the central bank if the inflation rate deviated too far from the government's inflation objective.NUM But Walsh's contracts are best treated as a metaphor rather than as a literal proposal for central bank reform. Although the pay of central bankers is unlikely ever to depend directly on the realized rate of inflation, central bankers, like most people, care about many other aspects of their jobs, including their professional reputations, the prestige of the institutions in which they serve, and the probability that they will be reappointed. Walsh's analysis and many subsequent refinements by other authors suggest that central bank performance might be improved if the government set explicit performance standards for the central bank (perhaps as part of the institution's charter or enabling legislation) and regularly compared objectives and outcomes. Alternatively, because central banks may possess the greater expertise in determining what economic outcomes are both feasible and most desirable, macroeconomic goals might be set through a joint exercise of the government and the central bank. Many countries have established targets for inflation, for example, and central bankers in those countries evidently make strong efforts to attain those targets. The Federal Reserve Act does not set quantitative goals for the U.S. central bank, but it does specify the objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment and requires the central bank to present semi-annual reports to the Congress on monetary policy and the state of the economy. Accountability to the public as well as to the legislature is also important; for this reason, the central bank should explain regularly what it is trying to achieve and why. In sum, Walsh's paper can be read as providing theoretical support for an explicit, well-designed, and transparent framework for monetary policy, one which sets forth the objectives of policy and holds central bankers accountable for reaching those objectives (or, at least, for providing a detailed and plausible explanation of why the objectives were missed). In the simple model that Walsh analyzes, the optimal contract provides all the incentives needed to induce the best possible monetary policy, so that appointing a hawkish central banker is no longer beneficial. However, in practice - because Walsh's optimal contracts can be roughly approximated at best, because both the incentives and the policy decisions faced by central bankers are far more complex than can be captured by simple models, and because the appointment of an inflation-averse central banker may provide additional assurance to the public that the government and the central bank will keep their promises - the Walsh approach and the Rogoff approach are almost certainly complementary.NUM That is, a clear, well-articulated monetary policy framework; inflation-averse central bankers; and autonomy for central banks in the execution of policy are all likely to contribute to increased central bank credibility and hence better policy outcomes. Of course, other factors that I could not cover in this short review, such as the central bank's reputation for veracity as established over time, may also strengthen its credibility (Barro and Gordon, DATE; Backus and Driffill, DATE).NUM Let me end where I began, with reference to Paul Volcker and his contributions. I have discussed DATE how Volcker's personality and performance inspired one seminal piece of research about the determinants of central bank credibility. In focusing on a few pieces of academic research, however, I have greatly understated the impact of the Volcker era on views about central banking. The Volcker disinflation (and analogous episodes in the United Kingdom, Canada, and elsewhere) was undoubtedly a major catalyst for an explosion of fresh thinking by economists and policymakers about central bank credibility, how it is obtained, and its benefits for monetary policy-making. Over the past DATE, this new thinking has contributed to a wave of changes in central banking, particularly with respect to the institutional design of central banks and the establishment of new frameworks for the making of monetary policy. Ironically, the applicability of the ideas stimulated by the Volcker chairmanship to the experience of the U.S. economy under his stewardship remains unclear. Though the appointment of Volcker undoubtedly increased the credibility of the Federal Reserve, the Volcker disinflation was far from a costless affair, being associated with a minor recession in DATE and a deep recession in DATE-NUM Evidently, Volcker's personal credibility notwithstanding, Americans' memories of the inflationary DATE were too fresh for their inflation expectations to change quickly. It is difficult to know whether alternative tactics would have helped; for example, the announcement of explicit inflation objectives (which would certainly have been a radical idea at the time) might have helped guide inflation expectations downward more quickly, but they might also have created a political backlash that would have doomed the entire effort. Perhaps no policy approach or set of institutional arrangements could have eliminated the DATE inflation at a lower cost than was actually incurred. If so, then the significance of Paul Volcker's appointment was not its immediate effect on expectations or credibility but rather the fact that he was one of the rare individuals tough enough and with sufficient foresight to do what had to be done. By doing what was necessary to achieve price stability, the Volcker Fed laid the groundwork for DATE, so far, of strong economic performance.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: John Taylor's contribution to monetary theory and policy Opening remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the Conference on John Taylor's Contribution to Monetary Theory and Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas (via videoconference), DATE.    It is a privilege for me to open this conference dedicated to our colleague and friend, John Taylor. John's influence on monetary theory and policy has been profound indeed. That influence has been manifest in undergraduate lecture halls and graduate seminar rooms, in the best research journals, and in the highest ranks of government. His ability to crystallize important analytical insights and apply them to policy issues is unsurpassed. Indeed, in a speech DATE, I noted three concepts named after John that are central to understanding our macroeconomic experience of DATE--the Taylor curve, the Taylor rule, and the Taylor principle (Bernanke, DATE). I'd like to take TIME to review John's career and impressive body of work. After receiving his Ph.D. from Stanford DATE, John began his career as an assistant professor at Columbia University. Even in DATE, John revealed his interest in applying the analytical tools of economics to practical policy issues. He took a leave of absence from academia in DATE to serve on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers. I suspect that the circumstances of DATE intensified John's motivation to help improve economic performance through sound policymaking. During DATE and DATE, John published a number of highly influential papers, including: \"Conditions for Unique Solutions in Stochastic Macroeconomic Models with Rational Expectations,\" \"Estimation and Control of a Macroeconomic Model with Rational Expectations,\" \"Aggregate Dynamics and Staggered Contracts,\" and \"Solution and Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Dynamic Nonlinear Rational Expectations Models.\" (As you can tell, John has always had a penchant for catchy titles.) Beyond its important technical contributions, this work showed that the insights and methods of the rational expectations revolution could be applied to models with sticky wages and prices. That observation has proved enormously influential in subsequent policy research. The rational expectations revolution helped to kill the idea of a long-run tradeoff between the levels of inflation and unemployment. However, John's analysis showed that, in the presence of aggregate supply shocks, attempts by monetary policymakers to reduce the volatility of inflation over time could be associated with higher volatility in unemployment, and vice versa. John's visual depiction of this policy tradeoff has come to be known as the Taylor curve. Interestingly, John's work anticipated the possibility that improvements in the conduct of monetary policy or changes in the structure of the economy could result in a shift of the Taylor curve--that is, a change in the ability of policy to smooth both inflation and employment. And indeed, what economists have dubbed the Great Moderation--a simultaneous reduction in the volatility of inflation and the volatility of real economic activity-has occurred in the United States and in many other economies over DATE. Over the course of DATE, John continued his work on rational expectations issues and monetary policy and macroeconomics more generally. He also began to broaden his focus to matters of international economics. He developed a multi-country rational expectations econometric model--a truly ambitious undertaking, especially in light of the limited computing capabilities of the era. By this point in his career, John had firmly established his reputation as a leader in the profession. In DATE, John became a member of the first President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. During DATE, he played a key role in shaping the Administration's positions on macroeconomic, fiscal, international finance, and trade issues. The U.S. economy was entering a difficult period at that point. Among other problems, significant pressures on bank balance sheets were beginning to emerge that would damp economic growth for DATE. While dealing with the serious economic issues of the time, John and the other members of the Council simultaneously produced an impressive manifesto for policymaking. They developed a rules-based approach to the conduct of monetary and fiscal Economic Report of the policy and published it in DATE in the President. That essay laid the foundation for what is perhaps John's most well-known contribution to economics--the simple description of the determinants of monetary policy that eventually became known as the Taylor rule.NUM John's analysis triggered an avalanche of studies examining the stabilization properties of Taylor rules in the context of macroeconomic models. Other work investigated the ability of variants of the Taylor rule to describe empirically the actual course of monetary policy in the United States and in other economies. The Taylor rule also embeds a basic principle of sound monetary policy that has subsequently been referred to as the Taylor principle.NUM According to this principle, when a shock causes a shift in the inflation rate, the central bank must adjust the nominal interest rate by more than one-for-one. This ensures that the real interest rate moves in the right direction to restore price stability. The Taylor principle provides essential guidance for central banks on how to anchor long-run inflation expectations and foster stable growth and low inflation. Ever since its inception, John has emphasized that the Taylor rule should not be applied mechanistically. The world is far too complicated for that. But he has argued that such rules can serve as useful benchmarks for the practical conduct of monetary policy. In fact, policymakers at the Federal Reserve and many other central banks do routinely consult various policy rules as they make judgments on the appropriate stance of monetary policy. After DATE at Stanford, John was called again to Washington by President Bush-this time the current President Bush. He served as Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Treasury from DATE through DATE. Our economy faced severe challenges during that period--the terrorist attacks of DATE, a recession and the threat of deflation, corporate governance scandals, and economic issues posed by the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Suffice it to say, John earned his stripes as the leader of the \"Global Financial Warriors.\" As detailed in his book of the same title, John worked extensively on the financial reconstruction of Iraq and on the development of financial tools for fighting terrorism. The Treasury Department recognized his efforts in DATE with its Distinguished Service Award and in DATE with the Alexander Hamilton Award for leadership in international finance. After his stint at Treasury, John returned once again to the less tumultuous life of a professor, ensconced in his offices at Stanford University and the Hoover Institution. I'm sure that, in between teaching and guiding the work of graduate students, he will continue to offer insightful commentary on monetary policy and other economic issues. And doubtless he will also continue to do pathbreaking research. Indeed, with our appetites whetted by the Taylor rule, principle, and curve, we now look forward to the Taylor dictum, the Taylor hyperbola, and maybe even the Taylor conundrum. Before closing my remarks, I would like to express my appreciation to President Fisher and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for hosting this conference. It is a terrific opportunity for celebrating John's contributions to monetary theory and policy. The papers on the program testify to the breadth and depth of John's work. I wish I could be there with you DATE to listen to the presentations and participate in the discussions. However, I know that you will have a productive and collegial gathering over DATE. And I wish all of you--but especially my friend and colleague John Taylor--all the best in your endeavors. References Bernanke, Ben S.

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: A retrospective on business-cycle recoveries: are \"jobless\" recoveries the new norm? Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Exchequer Club of Washington luncheon, Washington, DC, DATE.    It is an honor for me to address the Exchequer Club of Washington, D.C. Your purpose of providing a frank and open exchange of information and opinion on national policy is indeed laudable. With business investment bouncing back and consumption continuing to grow, real gross domestic product seems to have been advancing at approximately a NUM percent DATE pace over DATE. In addition, both the labor market and the manufacturing sector, two areas that had been lagging through most of the recovery, appear to have finally started to advance. Private payroll employment has risen a little more than NUM,NUM per month, on average, since DATE, and although DATE increase of NUM,NUM was disappointing, there is little indication that the labor market's progress is stalling. The same may be said of the manufacturing sector, in which employment, before DATE decline, had posted DATE of solid gains, and production advanced strongly again in DATE. Of course, as some recent data remind us, there are always sizable uncertainties regarding both the likely rate of growth of economic activity and the trajectory of inflation. That said, the recovery from the DATE recession appears to be firmly on track. Accordingly, this seems to be a good time to take stock of what we should learn from recent business-cycle experience. In particular, we have experienced two \"jobless\" recoveries. Are these the new norm? The question is of more than academic interest. A change in business-cycle dynamics might dictate important changes in the conduct of monetary policy. As usual, the remarks I make DATE represent my own views, which are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee. Distinctive features of the current recovery A truism among students of business cycles is that no two cycles are ever exactly the same, and the current recovery has been unusual in several respects. For some time after the recovery began, businesses were reluctant to increase expenditures for fixed capital and to re-stock inventories. Business fixed investment usually jumps shortly after a business-cycle trough, as firms that held back during the recession rush to put new equipment in place to replace aging equipment and to meet the expected surge in demand. For example, in the year-and-a-half after each of the six troughs DATE, business fixed investment rose at an average DATE rate of NUM-NUM/NUM percent. But in the year-and-a-half after the trough of the DATE recession, firms actually decreased investment at an DATE rate of NUM⁄NUM percent; this decline occurred in addition to the sharp fall in capital spending (relative to GDP) that took place during the recession. Likewise, investment in business inventories, which had subtracted more than NUM percentage point from real GDP growth, on average, during the DATE leading up to the trough, failed to snap back in its usual fashion. Instead, the inventory stock was little changed, on balance, in DATE of the recovery. Some of this unusual behavior probably reflects the ability of modern firms to function with leaner inventories, but firms also appear to have been acting more cautiously. A second distinctive element of this recovery involved households. The household sector remained a relatively bright spot in the economy in DATE; increases in spending for consumption goods and housing prevented the downturn in investment from generating a deeper recession. Household spending has continued to rise at a solid pace during the recovery. However, because this recession included neither the typical sharp decline in purchases of durable goods nor the usual deceleration in outlays for other types of personal consumption, we have not seen the sharp increases in these areas that often follow a trough. Indeed, real consumer spending actually rose at a greater rate during the recession than it did over DATE of the recovery. Similarly, real residential investment continued to expand during the recession, and although the rate of growth was relatively subdued, it bore no resemblance to the sharp declines that characterized every previous recession in the post-World War II period; the acceleration since the upturn began has been relatively subdued as well. However, the most noted feature of the current recovery is that employment has been below par - another so-called jobless recovery. Private payroll employment, and DATE on net, continued to fall for DATE from the trough of the recession in late DATE. Private employment DATE remained well below its level when the recession began, and only in DATE had it climbed above its level when the recession ended. This situation contrasts sharply with the beginning of most postwar recoveries (although, as I will discuss later, not with the one in DATE), when employment surged. Similarly, with employment growth until recently having been wanting, the unemployment rate peaked DATE after the recession ended and has not yet fallen below its level at the time designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the economic trough. And quite possibly the unemployment rate has been understating the amount of slack in the labor market because labor-force participation has been unusually weak, perhaps reflecting an assessment on the part of many households that job availability would be poor for those actually in the labor market. The output growth that largely defines the recovery resulted from impressive growth in labor productivity. During the DATE of falling employment, productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose about NUM percent per year. Part of this spectacular performance is typical. One expects productivity to rise quickly during the early stages of a recovery; as utilization rates rise, companies find more for their workers to do. Part of the growth of labor productivity may have to do with unusual, and transitory, hesitation on the part of businesses to hire, a topic to which I will return. Happily, however, the recent increases appear to have an important structural component as well. Whereas most recessions since World War II had no productivity growth or had outright declines, productivity during this past recession rose at a rate of more than NUM percent. And this growth was a continuation of the rapid gains that characterized the latter half of the DATEs. The favorable performance of productivity likely is related to another unusual feature of this recovery: the behavior of prices. Productivity growth in DATE leading up to the business-cycle peak in early DATE was one factor that contributed to keeping inflation low. Core prices for personal consumption expenditures advanced at an average DATE rate of less than NUM percent over the DATE preceding the peak - despite unemployment rates down around NUM percent. Moreover, prices decelerated during the recovery. At this time DATE we observed core PCE inflation in the vicinity of NUM percent. In fact, inflation was so low, especially once known biases in the price indexes are taken into account, that for DATE the FOMC was concerned more about the possibility of \"inflation becoming undesirably low\" than about the risk of a rise in inflation. These low rates of inflation coming into the recession and continuing into the recovery were one reason why the Federal Reserve responded so aggressively to the downturn and why we maintained a historically low federal funds rate so long after the trough. Just how aggressive was this response, relative to history? In general, comparing monetary policy responses across cyclical episodes is difficult. The natural indicator to look at, the federal funds rate, is measured in nominal terms, so that large movements in the rate of inflation can mask the underlying stance of policy. Moreover, an easing of a certain size might be considered relatively more or less aggressive depending on the magnitude and nature of the shocks hitting the economy. Still, in the current cycle, the Fed began lowering the federal funds rate DATE before the official cyclical peak (as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research) and lowered rates NUM basis points over DATE of the easing and NUM basis points over DATE. Although this total decline of NUM basis points was not the largest on record, it was large and quite early. And given the relatively small decline in output in DATE, one can easily argue that this monetary policy response was unusually aggressive. Similarities with the recovery in DATE In the period since World War II, several of the earlier recoveries had one or two of these features in common with the most recent period. For example, the rebound in residential investment fell short of the typical burst in DATE, the unemployment rate remained stubbornly high in DATE, and inventory investment remained low in DATE. But no previous recovery looked quite like this one. However, the recovery following the DATE recession stands out as similar to the current episode in several important respects. First, employment rose at a glacial pace for DATE after the trough in DATE, and the unemployment rate continued to rise. Second, the business sector continued for DATE to reduce spending on fixed investment and to refrain from accumulating significant amounts of inventories. Third, household spending did not accelerate rapidly after the DATE recession. Instead, both consumption expenditures and residential investment posted among the most-subdued recoveries in DATE. One should note, however, that household expenditures did fall markedly during the DATE recession, unlike the most recent episode. Figuring out why these two recoveries were atypically hesitant and jobless is not an easy task. Let me consider several possible explanations. One explanation for the similarity of the two most recent recoveries may be that both of these lukewarm recoveries followed shallow recessions. The shallowness of the downturns is consistent with the general moderation of the volatility of U.S. economic activity in DATE, which many observers have noted. The DATE decline in total output - only NUM⁄NUM percent spread over DATE - was so small that the level of real GDP exceeded its pre-recession peak by DATE. Similarly, real GDP fell only NUM-NUM/NUM percent in the DATE recession. One could argue that, because little ground was lost during the recessions, little ground was available to be regained in the recovery phase. However, the recession of DATE was not any deeper, yet investment spending and payroll employment growth shot up immediately after the trough. Accordingly, a shallow recession does not appear to guarantee a shallow recovery. A second possibility is that the labor market has changed in a way that makes jobless recoveries the new norm. For example, perhaps the pace of structural change in the demand for labor has increased over time. One could point, say, to a smaller proportion of temporary layoffs among job losers during the past two episodes as an indication that re-employment is now more likely to require changing employers than it was in earlier times. And the common perception is that workers are now more likely to have to change industries or occupations to remain employed. From a firm's perspective, hiring new workers for different jobs rather than recalling former workers to their previous jobs is likely to involve greater up-front costs in terms of recruitment and training, and the shifts in demand that created the need for new workers mean that hiring is associated with new capital as well. In this case, firms may require greater confidence in the durability of demand for their products to be willing to incur the costs involved in hiring. Many analysts argue, however, that the labor market has become more flexible since workers have become less attached to individual firms, jobs have become more project-oriented, wage setting has become less rigid, and the use of temporary help and other \"contingent\" work arrangements has become more prevalent. These developments reduce the up-front costs and commitments involved in hiring and should make firms more willing to hire as demand for their products revives. Therefore, the case for structural change in the labor market as the cause of the jobless recoveries is far from conclusive. It is tempting to interpret the two recent recoveries as reflecting a fundamental shift in the behavior of the economy or the labor market over the business cycle. Indeed, the two explanations for slow economic recoveries that I have discussed - shallower recessions and structural change in the labor market - likely contain some elements of the truth. However, the structure of the economy is always in flux to some extent, and I think it probable that experiencing two hesitant recoveries in a row was largely a matter of coincidence. In each case, idiosyncratic factors that were specific to each episode combined in a way that inhibited the economic expansion in important sectors when other fundamentals would have favored a more typical cyclical upturn. I will discuss these factors now. Idiosyncratic factors inhibiting recoveries The strength of a recovery may be related to the nature of the shocks that led the economy into recession. In contrast to earlier recessions, which were often sparked by tightening monetary policy, the DATE recession was triggered by a pullback in aggregate demand not induced by monetary policy. In DATE, oil prices increased and consumer confidence dropped sharply; both occurrences were at least partly related to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In response, consumer spending dropped sharply. Although the Federal Reserve had tightened policy in DATE to restrain price pressures, it was loosening again by DATE. Similarly, before the DATE downturn, the Federal Reserve was not aggressively tightening. Rather, the DATE recession seems to have been kicked off by unreasonable expectations about the profitability of investment in technology related to the Internet. One manifestation of these overly optimistic expectations was that the nominal share of high-tech investment in overall equipment and software spending rose from about NUM percent in the mid-DATEs to almost NUM percent by DATE. By the time more-sober assessments of the profitability of the high-tech sector came to the fore, huge sums of money had been sunk into capital equipment and software and into new enterprises. A serious reconsideration of these expenditures contributed to a sharp retrenchment of business investment. Although the causes of these two most recent recessions were clearly different, they were similar along one important dimension: Both were related to changes in the subjective appraisals by persons and businesses of fundamental economic prospects, and to heightened uncertainty about those prospects. In real time, it is extraordinarily difficult to determine the likely severity and duration of these types of shocks. Using monetary policy to counter a shock of this nature is not as straightforward as reversing an earlier tightening. In retrospect, it is clear that during the two most recent recoveries these subjective views improved and uncertainty abated only slowly. Therefore, the first idiosyncratic reason why these recoveries were tepid was likely that the preceding recessions were caused by shocks that proved to have longer-lasting effects and that were more difficult to counteract than expected. In the wake of the two recent downturns, further idiosyncratic shocks hit the economy, exacerbating the sluggishness of the recoveries. In DATE, the collapse of savings and loan institutions and the need to repair the capital structure of the banking industry led to a period in which the flow of credit to businesses was impaired - the so-called credit crunch. Facing limited access to credit, businesses - especially small businesses - curtailed hiring and capital expenditures. After the trough in DATE, the banking industry was much sounder. However, the economy was still adjusting to the excess capital spending from the late DATEs. Equipment takes DATE to depreciate; so when firms realized that they had purchased more than they needed, they did not feel compelled to raise their level of capital expenditures again for quite some time. Indeed, this \"overhang\" of capital has likely contributed to the impressive growth in productivity over the past few DATE, as businesses have made more and better use of the high-tech equipment they had previously installed but underexploited. Besides the boom-bust cycle in capital spending, the U.S. economy confronted the terrorist attacks of DATE, the corporate governance scandals of DATE, and the DATE war in Iraq. Clearly, such an uncertain and risky environment, which led many firms to question the durability and strength of the recovery, encouraged neither the creation of new jobs nor the expansion of capacity. This discussion of the post-recession shocks that damped the pace of the most recent two recoveries does not imply that similar obstacles were absent in earlier recoveries. The early stages of previous recoveries also contained events that legitimately raised concerns about the vitality and viability of the upturns. Indeed, at the beginning of each recovery for at least DATE, some observers expressed concern that various factors might result in a tepid recovery. In DATE, for instance, as the United States emerged from recession, growth in the rest of the world was moribund, and the international financial system was considered fragile. Other concerns were that the length of the recession would make consumers and businesses cautious and that changes in the economy would lead to prolonged structural unemployment. In DATE, concerns were that the recovery would be weak because businesses were still adjusting to higher oil prices and pollution regulations and because several large cities (most famously New York) were having serious financial troubles. In addition, the housing industry was threatened by a large inventory of unsold homes as well as difficulties obtaining financing after the collapse of the market for real estate investment trusts. Even after the relatively mild recession of DATE, a speculative crisis in foreign exchange markets and apprehensions on the part of businesses about just-enacted wage and price controls and environmental regulations fueled some pessimism about the prospects for a quick recovery. Geopolitical tensions, which may seem like a distinctive feature of the past two business cycles, also weighed on analysts' minds following the cyclical troughs in DATE and DATE. The DATE-NUM recovery coincided with the building of the Berlin Wall, the resumption of nuclear weapons testing in the Soviet Union, and other incidents that heightened Cold War tensions in various parts of the world. The DATE-NUM recovery coincided with a crisis in the Middle East that involved the entry of U.S. troops into Lebanon as well as a crisis in the market for Treasury securities that kept Fed observers, at least, on the edges of their seats. Thus, adverse conditions and events were certainly not confined to the two most recent recoveries. In the earlier cases I have just noted, however, these headwinds did not, in the event, result in sluggish recoveries. Given the disparate nature of the shocks across these episodes, one cannot say with certainty why the particular combinations of factors in the most recent cases led to a different outcome. The upshot for policy, unfortunately, is that clearly identifying both the possible obstacles to a recovery and the ramifications of those obstacles is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Conclusion In summary, delayed and sluggish improvements in the labor market, business equipment investment, and inventory accumulation mark the two most recent recoveries as different from other recoveries after World War II. Why these most recent two recoveries have been atypically hesitant and jobless is unclear. As I have discussed, the shallowness of the recessions and the possible structural changes in the labor market may have played some role. However, I think that important weight should be given to idiosyncratic features such as the causes of the preceding recessions and the occurrence of additional shocks after the recessions ended that exacerbated the economy's problems. This view implies that monetary policymaking probably does not need to be altered in a systematic way to accommodate a new sort of business-cycle dynamics. On the contrary, the fact that the two most recent recoveries have involved slow job growth in their initial stages may best be attributed to chance rather than a new structure of the economy. Each recovery faces its own obstacles, and understanding the forces acting on the economy at any point requires continual monitoring of a wide range of indicators of economic activity, household and business attitudes, financial market developments, and price pressures. In all cases, however, the touchstone guiding policy should be the mandate given to the Federal Reserve: a foundation of stable prices underpinning maximum sustainable growth.",

                  "Alan Greenspan: Central Bank panel discussion - economic developments Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the International Monetary Conference, London (via satellite), DATE.    One of the defining characteristics of the recent business expansion in the United States has been the evident reluctance of corporate managers to expand spending and hiring aggressively in response to and in anticipation of continued cyclical growth. A substantial rebound in business spending had been a hallmark of most past economic expansions. Judging by the pickup in capital spending in DATE, businesses are becoming more confident in the strength and durability of the cyclical upturn. Still, over DATE, corporate investment in capital and inventories likely fell short of rapidly rising cash flow for the first time, over a comparable period, since DATE. Corporate debt expansion has accordingly been tepid. Indeed, corporate net bond issuance was negative in DATE. The exceptional reluctance to expand payrolls also appears to have waned DATE, and businesses are once again hiring with some vigor. But for DATE prior, managers sought every avenue to forestall new hiring despite rising business sales. Their ability to boost output without adding appreciably to their workforces, appears to have reflected a backlog of unexploited capabilities to enhance productivity with minimal capital investment, a delayed effect of the capital goods boom of DATE. Even now, the proportion of increases in temporary workers relative to total employment gains has been unusually large, suggesting that business caution remains a feature of the economic landscape. This hesitancy on the part of businesses to expand risk-taking, as I have noted in the past, is an apparent consequence of scandals surrounding corporate accounting and governance, an aftermath of the stock market surge. Although there is no compelling evidence that corporate governance risk has fully subsided, with time, it should. An increased willingness to borrow, and ample liquid assets, should provide a further lift to capital investment and, with it, economic activity.    With concerns of deflation now presumably safely behind us, developments ahead are likely to be dominated by the paths of productivity growth and profit margins - assuming, of course, the always latent danger of terrorism in the United States remains in check. Profits of nonfinancial corporations as a share of sector output, after falling to NUM percent in DATE, rebounded to NUM percent in DATE, a pace of advance not experienced since DATE. This sharp recovery in profits reflects, at least in part, the dramatic swing over DATE from relatively heavy business price discounting to the restoration of a significant degree of pricing power. The most visible manifestation of the return to pricing power can be seen in the recent acceleration of core consumer prices. The DATE percent change in the core PCE price index, which stood at just above NUM percent in DATE, was at NUM percent in DATE. To better understand recent developments, it is helpful to view prices from the perspective of consolidated costs and profit margins. From DATE to DATE, consolidated unit costs for the nonfinancial corporate business sector declined. Hence, at least from an accounting perspective, all of the NUM percent increase in the prices of final goods and services produced in that sector during that period was the consequence of a rise in profit margins. The NUM percent increase in nonfinancial corporate business productivity over those DATE accounts for much of the decline in unit costs. The remainder of the decline is accounted for by the effects of accelerating output in reducing nonlabor fixed costs per unit of output. Productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector evidently decelerated somewhat DATE. Moreover, as best we can judge, the growth of compensation per hour has stepped up in DATE. With gains in TIME compensation now apparently outstripping advances in productivity, unit labor costs have moved up. Moreover, the increase in overall operating expenses over DATE has also reflected higher energy costs and rising prices of imported non-oil inputs. It seems unlikely, however, that a further rise in profit margins will contribute to significantly higher prices of final goods and services. In an endeavor to exploit current high margins, businesses are being driven to expand their use of capital and labor resources. If history is any guide, this will tend to increase both real wages and interest rates. Fears of losing market share should dissuade businesses from passing these high costs fully through to prices. Accordingly, the forces of competition should cap the rise in profit margins and ultimately return them to more normal levels. To date, the aforementioned cost pressures have been relatively subdued. Nonetheless, the persistence of the rise in energy prices is a worrisome element in the cost picture. Fears for the long-term security of oil production in the Middle East, along with increased concerns about prospects in other oil-producing countries, are doubtless key factors behind the nearly $NUM per barrel rise in distant crude oil futures since DATE. This run-up presumably reflects a broadening of demand for claims on oil inventories beyond traditional commercial buyers and sellers of crude oil and petroleum products. The marked rise in the net long positions of non-commercial investors in oil futures and options since DATE NUM has increased net claims on an already diminished global level of commercial crude and product inventories. Oil prices accordingly have surged. At some point, however, investors will have achieved the level of claims on oil that they seek. When that occurs, their demand will presumably stop rising, thus removing some of the current upward pressure on prices. Nonetheless, the increased value of oil imports has been a net drain on purchasing power, spending, and production in the United States. Moreover, higher oil prices, if they persist, are likely to boost core consumer prices, as well as the total price level, in this country. The recent modest declines in oil and natural gas prices may or may not signal a trend but are nonetheless welcome.    The end of deflationary fears and the onset of modest upward pressure on costs, coupled with a strengthening economic outlook in the United States, have driven long-term interest rates higher, which has spurred a marked shift in credit flows and has prompted many firms to focus on the possibility of further interest rate increases in developing their hedging strategies. The rise in rates, for example, has induced a dramatic fall in mortgage refinancing and, hence, has produced a pronounced rise in the duration of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Owing to the volume of the earlier wave of mortgage refinancing, there is now a paucity of existing mortgages at rates appreciably above current levels, implying that the extent of further duration hedging is likely to be quite modest. As a consequence of record levels of refinancing in DATE and DATE - which, by our estimates, encompassed roughly NUM percent of the total value of home mortgages outstanding - MBS duration fell to exceptionally low levels. As mortgage and other long-term rates rebounded DATE, a consequence of rapidly improving economic conditions and the fading of deflationary concerns, refinancing fell sharply, removing most downward pressure on duration. Holders of MBS endeavoring to hedge developing interest rate gaps rapidly shed receive-fixed swaps and Treasuries, and these actions markedly aggravated DATE's long-term interest rate upturn. In DATE, mortgage rates have risen further, suppressing much of what is left of incentives to refinance, thereby increasing mortgage duration to its current elevated level. This suggests that the vast secondary market for home mortgages has largely adjusted to the recent increases in mortgage rates. Moreover, the expectation of Federal Reserve tightening has apparently already induced other significant balance sheet adjustments as well. An unwinding of carry trades is notably under way at least judging from the shift in the trading portfolios of primary dealers. In addition, a swing toward a net short position on DATE Treasury note futures among investors has been the largest since the inception of the contract in DATE.    Economic developments going forward will determine the level and term structure of interest rates. Federal funds futures prices already reflect expectations of a substantial firming of policy by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Unlike DATE, there has been an appreciable increase of market rates in anticipation of policy tightening, though history cautions that investors' anticipations of the cumulative magnitude of policy actions and their timing under such circumstances are far from perfect. Lastly, let me emphasize that recent financial indicators, including rapid growth of the money supply, underscore that the FOMC has provided ample liquidity to the financial system that will become increasingly unnecessary over time. The Committee is of the view, as you know, that monetary policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. That conclusion is based on our current best judgment of how economic and financial forces will evolve in DATE. Should that judgment prove misplaced, however, the FOMC is prepared to do what is required to fulfill our obligations to achieve the maintenance of price stability so as to ensure maximum sustainable economic growth.",

                  "Janet L Yellen: Views on the economy and implications for monetary policy Speech by Ms Janet L Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, at the Portland Community Leaders' Luncheon, Portland, Oregon, DATE.    Thank you for that very kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be here with you in this beautiful \"City of Roses.\" As a monetary policymaker, my main concern is the national economy, and that will be the chief focus of my remarks DATE. But as President of the San Francisco Fed, I also pay close attention to developments here in the Twelfth District, which, in many respects, mirror those of the nation. Looking at the big picture elements-growth, employment, and inflation-I'd say things are in reasonably good shape. Over DATE, the nation's output growth has been pretty steady, averaging just over four percent; this is solidly above trend, which, by most estimates, is DATE to three and a half percent. This growth has been amply in evidence here in the Pacific Northwest. While unemployment rates in Oregon and Washington remain above the nation's rate, your region has largely recovered from the severe hit you took during the DATE recession and its aftermath. As a result of sustained growth at the national level, slack in labor and product markets has trended down. At NUM percent, the national unemployment rate now stands near conventional estimates of the natural rate consistent with \"full employment.\" When it comes to inflation, I focus on core measures, which exclude the volatile food and energy components, to assess underlying trends. Two different measures of core inflation have given slightly different signals in DATE: one-the core CPI-is well within my comfort zone; the other-the core PCE-is at the upper end. However, I expect to see some moderation in inflation going forward. Similarly, most forecasters expect the pace of economic activity also to moderate toward trend-like growth. Given all this, it seems to me that the economy is on track to achieve price stability and \"maximum employment\"-the dual goals assigned to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Act-and that we'll likely continue to move in a positive direction over DATE. This sounds like a rosy scenario and I realize that it ignores all of the things that could go wrong. You might well ask, \"What about oil prices?\" \"What about the record trade deficit?\" \"What about the possibility of a housing bubble?\" \"What about the 'conundrum' of surprisingly low long-term interest rates?\" Well, indeed-what about them? You would be right to ask. These questions touch on important economic developments that create risks for the positive scenario I just described. They therefore receive serious attention at the policy table. From my perspective, trying to assess such risks is what makes the conduct of monetary policy both interesting and challenging. Inflation risks Let me start by looking at some of the factors that create risks for the inflation outlook and explain why I'm nevertheless fairly optimistic that inflation will moderate over DATE. Of course, oil prices do pose an inflation risk. The price of oil has just about doubled over DATE, from the low $NUM range to around $NUM per barrel recently. Higher oil prices are reflected in higher \"headline\" inflation. And they have been passed through to some extent to core inflation as well, but, unless they rise further, the effect on core inflation should begin to dissipate DATE. Another risk relates to labor compensation, which is the single largest component of business costs. Recently, one measure of compensation per hour jumped abruptly. Here, too, though, I am not terribly worried because a good part of the jump is probably accounted for by one-time events, such as bonus payments and the exercising of stock options. This interpretation is supported by readings from an alternative measure of labor compensation, the Employment Cost Index, which excludes these items and has recorded only modest increases. I'm also quite encouraged by several developments that portend a moderation in inflation going forward. For example, even with the recent revaluation of the Chinese renminbi, the dollar has increased by NUM⁄NUM percent against major currencies so far DATE, which should take some of the pressure off of import prices. In addition, inflation expectations, which may affect wage and price setting, appear to be edging lower: We see this both in survey results and in the financial markets- through noticeable declines in \"inflation compensation\", measured by the difference between the yields on Treasury bonds with and without inflation protection. A third factor is productivity growth. There have been concerns that a structural productivity slowdown was in the offing, which could put upward pressure on inflation; the good news is that structural productivity growth apparently still remains above the levels reached during DATE, although it may have edged down just a bit over DATE. A final factor impacting the inflation outlook is the degree of slack in the labor market. Right now, the unemployment rate is relatively low: at NUM percent it's near most estimates of the so-called natural rate. But other measures-such as the employment-population ratio, a survey of job market perceptions, and industrial capacity utilization-suggest that some slack still remains. Risks to economic growth and employment Now let me turn to the real side of the economy-growth and employment-and highlight some of the risks that affect my optimistic baseline projection. Even though overall growth has been respectable, economic activity has been burdened by some major drags over DATE. Three major ones result from the oil price shock, the deterioration of the trade balance, and a still relatively low level of business investment spending. As I mentioned, the price of oil has just about doubled over DATE. Typically, the markets view oil price jumps as temporary. But this time around, far-dated oil futures prices also have increased sharply, suggesting that the high prices may be here to stay. This is a highly unusual development. Most likely, it reflects the perception that there is little excess supply of oil available in the world and that global demand is likely to remain strong. The perception that the oil price shock is more permanent tends to intensify its negative effect on spending. Estimates suggest that the oil price shock has noticeably restrained real GDP growth-by about three quarters of a percentage point in DATE. This impact is certainly nontrivial. However, it is worth emphasizing that the recent price change and spending impacts are far smaller than those of the oil shocks in DATE. The U.S. trade deficit, as we all know very well, has been growing rapidly for DATE. By DATE, it topped five and three-quarters percent of GDP, a new record. Two of the major factors contributing to the sizable imbalance between our imports and our exports are the strength of the U.S. economy relative to our major trading partners and the relative strength of the dollar. In DATE, the increase in the trade deficit-by itself-subtracted almost one percentage point from real GDP growth, representing a significant drag on overall activity. Finally, while business investment in equipment and software rose strongly DATE, by almost NUM percent, the level of investment is still not as high relative to GDP as we'd expect, given favorable economic conditions and firms' healthy balance sheets. Economic growth has been solid for a few DATE now. And, with the very low level of interest rates, borrowing costs can't be the problem. Moreover, profit margins have been high for some time, so firms are certainly not strapped for cash. The shortfall might be due to business caution, perhaps related to reverberations from NUM/NUM and subsequent terrorist threats and actions or perhaps to the corporate governance scandals and the adjustments required by the legislation that followed them. Alternatively, the investment shortfall might reflect the perception by businesses that productivity gains can be realized at this stage that do not require major new investments in equipment and software. Whatever the explanation, the consequence of these drags is that the Fed had to keep interest rates exceptionally low for a long time just to get respectable, but not stellar, economic growth. In fact, the federal funds rate was lowered all the way to NUM percent and held there until the middle of DATE. Since then, the FOMC has raised the funds rate nine times to NUM⁄NUM percent, but it still remains in a range normally considered stimulative. Bond rate conundrum Increases in the federal funds rate typically lead to increases in longer-term interest rates. But, as we all know, long-term rates have actually fallen as the FOMC has raised short-term rates. For example, the benchmark DATE Treasury rate is down by more than NUM⁄NUM percentage point since the funds rate started heading up in the middle of DATE. This is the basis for what Chairman Greenspan has called the bond rate \"conundrum\" that has commanded so much attention recently. There is a debate about how to interpret the decline in longer term yields and it essentially boils down to whether the surprising behavior of long rates is due to various \"special factors\" operating independently of the current business cycle or instead augurs bad economic news on the horizon. If special factors are holding down long term yields, then the total amount of stimulus to spending from interest rates is currently greater than would be surmised on the basis of the current federal funds rate. In effect, unusually low long-term bond rates are now providing extra stimulus to offset the drags I described. A number of \"special factors\" might be at work to flatten the yield curve. One possibility is that low bond rates reflect a drop in risk premiums because inflation has become better anchored and the volatility of the real economy has fallen. But let me also note that other factors would seem to work in the opposite direction-for example, our large and growing federal budget and trade imbalances could be raising risk premiums. Another possibility is that low long-term rates reflect unusually strong demand for long-term securities, for example, by pension funds seeking to improve the match between the durations of their assets and liabilities, by holders of mortgage-backed securities seeking to maintain the durations of their portfolios, or by foreign central banks that have been acquiring dollars. China may have been playing an especially large role, as its central bank has intervened in foreign exchange markets to peg the renminbi at a low level against the dollar. Of course, DATE the People's Bank of China announced that it had revalued the renminbi against the dollar by NUM percent, with the stated intention of managing the renminbi's exchange value against an unspecified currency basket. This is not a large revaluation, but some observers think that it is the beginning of a much bigger move over time. If this is the case, we may gain a better understanding of the impact, if any, that Chinese exchange rate policy has had on U.S. bond rates. An alternative to \"special factors\" as an explanation for the low level of long-term yields is the possibility that the flat yield curve reflects the market's assessment that bad news is on the horizon. In other words, investors may expect only modest increases in the funds rate in the future because they think that the drags I've described will keep demand on the weak side for some time to come. We probably won't know the most important sources of this \"conundrum\" until more time passes, but the causes of the conundrum do matter to monetary policy. If the first class of explanations turns out to be correct, the federal funds rate probably needs to be somewhat higher than would otherwise be appropriate to offset the additional stimulus due to the flat yield curve. If the latter explanation fits the bill, and the market is correct that the drags going forward will be unusually strong, a somewhat easier policy may be appropriate. Housing Whatever the source of the conundrum, clearly low long-term rates have contributed to the continuing boom in the housing market. The share of residential investment in GDP is now at its highest level in DATE. The question on everyone's mind, of course, is whether this source of strength in the economy could reverse course and become instead a source of weakness. Put more bluntly: Is there a housing \"bubble\" that might collapse, and if so, what would that mean for the economy? To begin to answer this question, we need to know what we mean by the term \"bubble.\" A bubble does not just mean that prices are rising rapidly-it's more complicated than that. Instead, a bubble means that the price of an asset-in this case, housing-is significantly higher than its fundamental value. One common way of thinking about housing's fundamental value is to consider the ratio of housing prices to rents. The price-to-rent ratio is equivalent to the price-to-dividend ratio for stocks. In the case of housing, rents reflect the flow of benefits obtained from housing assets-either the monetary return from rental property, or the value of living in owner-occupied housing. Historically, the ratio for the nation as a whole has had many ups and downs, but over time it has tended to return to its long-run average. Thus, when the price-to-rent ratio is high, housing prices tend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend to rise more rapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be counted on only for rough guidance rather than a precise reading. Currently, the ratio for the country is higher than at any time since data became available in NUM- about NUM percent above its long-run average. Of course, the results vary widely from place to place. For Los Angeles and San Francisco, the price-to-rent ratio is about NUM percent higher than the normal level, while for Cleveland the ratio is very near its historical average. Closer to home, the figure for Seattle is just over DATE. For Portland, it turns out that the price-to-rent ratio is a bit anomalous. Unlike the ratio for the nation and many of the cities I've mentioned, Portland's ratio has been trending up, and this pattern has been going on since DATE. This means that there's not a stable long-run average ratio to use as a comparison for DATE's ratio, so the analysis we did for the other cities wouldn't be that meaningful for Portland. What we do know is that the pace of home price appreciation in Portland has been close to the national pace over the past few DATE, lagging behind somewhat in DATE as the state struggled to recover from the DATE recession, but mostly catching up in DATE and early DATE as economic growth picked up noticeably in the state. As of early DATE, home prices in the Portland area were up NUM percent over DATE, only a bit below the national pace of NUM⁄NUM percent. More recently, I've heard reports that upscale homes in the Portland area are increasingly being sold at above-asking price-a phenomenon we're all too familiar with in the Bay Area! So it's clear that Portland's housing market has been hot, but I'm sure that's no surprise to you. In any event, as I said before, the fact that the ratios for the nation and many areas of the country are higher than normal doesn't necessarily prove that there's a bubble. House prices could be high for some good reasons that affect their fundamental value. The most obvious reason is the low level of mortgage rates. This stems both from very stimulative monetary policy and from the conundrum I discussed earlier. Conventional mortgage rates have dropped from around NUM percent in early DATE to around NUM percent recently. Other factors could also be raising housing's fundamental value. For example, recent changes in tax laws may be having an effect. In DATE, tax rates on capital gains were lowered and the exemption from capital gains taxation for housing was raised to $NUM,NUM. Both of these changes would reduce the potential tax bite from selling one home and buying another. Another development, which may be making housing more like an investment vehicle, is that it's now easier and cheaper to get at the equity-either through refinancing, which has become a less costly process, or through an equity line of credit. Both of these innovations in mortgage markets make the funds invested in houses more liquid. So there are good reasons to think that fundamental factors have played a role in the unusually high price-to-rent ratio. But the bottom line here is fuzzy. It's very hard to say how big a role these factors have played, so we don't know how much remains unexplained. Frankly, even the best available estimates are imprecise, and they don't definitively answer the question: Is there a bubble, and if there is, how large is it? Given this uncertainty, my focus as a monetary policymaker is on trying to understand what kind of risks a drop in house prices would pose for the economy. One of the classic ways to do this is to ask \"What if...?\"-in other words, to pose a purely hypothetical question. In this case, the \"what if\" question might be, \"What's the likely effect if national house prices did fall by NUM percent, enough to bring the price-to-rent ratio back to its historical average?\" Before going any further, I want to emphasize that I'm not making any predictions about house price movements, but instead, simply discussing how a prudent monetary policymaker could assess the risk. First, there would be an effect on consumers' wealth. With housing wealth nearing $NUM trillion DATE, such a drop in house prices would extinguish about $NUM⁄NUM trillion of household wealth-equal to about NUM percent of GDP. Standard estimates suggest that for each dollar of wealth lost, households tend to cut back on spending by around NUM⁄NUM cents. This amounts to a decrease in consumer spending of about NUM⁄NUM percent of GDP. To get some perspective on how big the effect would be, it's worth comparing it with the stock market decline that began in DATE. In that episode, the extinction of wealth was much greater-stock market wealth fell by $NUM⁄NUM trillion from DATE to DATE. This suggests that if house prices were to drop by NUM percent, the impact on the economy might be about half what it was when the stock market turned down a few DATE ago. Moreover, the spending pullback wouldn't happen all of a sudden. Wealth effects-positive or negative-tend to affect spending with fairly long lags. So, a drop in house prices probably would lead to a gradual cutback in spending, giving the Fed time to respond by lowering short-term interest rates and keeping the economy steady. Now let's complicate things. Suppose house prices started falling because bond and mortgage interest rates started rising as the conundrum was resolved, say, because the risk premium in bonds rose due to concerns about federal budget deficits or other factors. Then we'd have the cutback in spending because of the wealth effect, plus there'd likely be further spending cutbacks, as borrowing costs for households rose. Furthermore, a rise in long-term rates would have effects beyond just households-it also would dampen business investment in capital goods through a higher cost of capital. How manageable would this scenario be? Like the wealth effect, these added interest-rate effects operate with a lag, so, again, there probably would be time for monetary policy to respond by lowering short-term interest rates. This obviously would not be a \"slam dunk,\" but in many circumstances it would seem manageable. A matter of more concern is whether this scenario would lead to financial disruptions that could cause spending to slow sharply and quickly. One issue that receives a lot of attention is the increasing use of potentially riskier types of loans, like variable rate and interest-only loans that may make borrowers and lenders vulnerable to a fall in house prices or increase in interest rates. I believe that the odds of widespread financial disruption on this count are fairly slim, although, clearly, some borrowers are vulnerable. First, the shift to these new instruments appears relatively modest overall. Second, the equity cushions available to both borrowers and lenders still seem, on average, to be pretty substantial. This is evident in looking at loan-to-value ratios, which have fallen, on average, as home valuations have risen faster than mortgage debt. In addition, most financial institutions enjoy comfortable capital positions, so they're better able to weather any problems with their mortgage portfolios. Finally, some of the risk associated with mortgages has been transferred from banks to investors, as banks have sold off securitized bundles of mortgage debt. These investors may be in a better position to handle the associated risk. So, while there undoubtedly would be some fallout from a substantial drop in house prices, the financial system and consumers appear to be in reasonably good shape to handle the situation. Monetary policy I'd like to close my remarks by taking a step back from the home price story and putting it in the broader context of the economy's overall performance-which, after all, is the chief concern of monetary policymakers. As I've emphasized, economic activity has been burdened by some major drags over the past several DATE. As a result, the Fed has had to keep interest rates exceptionally low for a long time just to get respectable economic growth. In fact, respectable growth is all we have gotten-even with exceptionally low long-term yields and unexpectedly rapid gains in house prices. This growth has had to rest on the backs of just a few interest-sensitive sectors-business investment, consumer durables, and housing. From this perspective, it's not all that surprising that housing markets have been hot. My point is that to offset the \"drags\" we've needed to give the economy a strong dose of stimulus-which inevitably boosted the housing sector. As I've discussed, if a sizable reversal in house prices were to occur, it probably would affect the economy mainly through the lagged effects of declines in wealth and increases in interest rates, rather than through widespread financial disruptions. This would give monetary policy time to react to any resulting economic weakness by lowering interest rates. In addition, the magnitude of the potential house price overvaluation may be only around half that of the earlier stock market overvaluation. In conclusion, policy still appears to be somewhat accommodative, and given the recent inflation performance and the dwindling of slack, it makes sense to continue the process of removing that accommodation. I hope I've provided you with some insight on the issues that I think are important to focus on as the Fed goes through this process. I look forward to taking your questions.

                  "Donald L Kohn: Economic outlook Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the NUM Conference of Twelfth District Directors, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, DATE.    The economy has been performing well of late. Economic activity has shown a good bit of forward momentum as businesses have stepped up their purchases of capital equipment and households have continued to increase their spending on consumer goods and services and on houses. As a result, economic growth has been sufficient to continue eroding slack in labor and product markets. Inflation has picked up over DATE, but from very low levels and with much of the overall acceleration attributable to an increase in energy prices that should not be repeated any time soon. Still, as solid growth has become more firmly entrenched and slack has diminished, our focus at the Federal Reserve has naturally and predictably shifted more to the outlook for inflation. The strength of the economy has reflected in part the stance of monetary policy; we have been holding interest rates at very low levels for some time. We adopted that policy DATE to encourage economic expansion when several forces - such as the decline in equity prices and the pullback in investment spending - were holding back demand and economic activity, and we knew that it would become increasingly inappropriate as those forces waned. Unless policy is tightened as slack diminishes, inflation will pick up, undermining growth and destabilizing the economy when the inevitable correction occurs. Our view has been that we could probably remove our accommodative policy gradually - \"at a measured pace\" in our jargon. But that expectation has depended on an outlook for inflation remaining contained and growth only moderately exceeding that of the economy's potential. Recently, some indicators have raised questions about this outlook, and I thought this would be an opportune time to offer my appraisal of some of the forces shaping the economy and their implications for policy. I underscore that these views are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.NUM Economic activity Robust spending by the household sector has supported economic activity for DATE - during the downturn and early stages of the subsequent recovery and now in the economic expansion. Consumer spending has been boosted by growth in disposable personal income, interest rates that are low by historical standards, and gains in net worth. The increase in wealth in DATE has come in part from the rebound in equity prices, as well as from the rapid rise in house prices. Borrowing against the resulting buildup of equity in homes has provided a relatively low-cost source of funds for financing consumption. Rising home prices, income gains, and low interest rates also have fueled expansion in the housing sector. Businesses increased investment outlays considerably in DATE, and recent data on orders and shipments suggest that business spending on capital equipment has continued to grow rapidly DATE. One question coming into DATE was how strong such spending would be. It was not clear how much of DATE very rapid growth could be attributed to special tax incentives for equipment spending that expired at DATE; those incentives could have been inducing businesses to pull forward spending into DATE. Apparently, however, most of the demand DATE was driven by fundamentals, and the expiration of the tax incentives has had little apparent damping effect on equipment outlays. Labor markets have shown gradual but steady improvement. Growth in employment has been uneven, but job gains have averaged NUM,NUM per month over DATE, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest level of the current expansion, down NUM/NUM a percentage point from DATE. Slack in the use of capital also has diminished. In manufacturing, capacity utilization has risen NUM-NUM/NUM percentage points over DATE and is now only modestly below its long-term average. Growing confidence and accommodative monetary policy seem to have been important influences behind the recent strength in the economy. Persistent low saving out of current income suggests that households believe that gains in their net worth from the increase in the prices of equities and homes will not be reversed, and that jobs and income will continue to rise at a healthy pace. The key new element in the picture is the behavior of the business sector. Apparently, the persistence of good growth in sales and profits has been restoring business confidence. At the same time, low interest rates, in part a product of accommodative monetary policy, are also playing an important role in encouraging investment in houses and business capital equipment by holding down the cost of borrowing and spending. Indeed, growing confidence may also be interacting with accommodative policy to help keep interest rates low. A number of factors have contributed to the unusually low long-term interest rates that we have seen, but one of them has been the changing attitude of savers toward risk.NUM Economic growth has been relatively steady at a moderate pace, and inflation, although higher, is expected to remain fairly low. As people have become increasingly confident that good economic performance will last for a while, they have asked for less extra compensation for taking the risks of lending for longer periods and to borrowers whose odds on default are usually viewed as high. These changing attitudes have helped produce an unusual phenomenon - the failure of longer-term interest rates to move higher in an expanding economy with rising short-term interest rates; for many businesses, longer-term borrowing costs have actually fallen since DATE. In this environment, the economy is likely to remain on a path of solid growth, strong enough to continue to gradually reduce unemployment and raise operating rates in industry for a while. Perhaps the logical question, given my description of favorable changes in confidence and financial conditions, is why \"gradually\" and only \"for a while\" - why not a much more rapid rate of expansion that will raise employment and production more quickly than we have experienced so far this expansion? The answer is that several forces seem to be leaning the other way, and will tend to restrain spending growth going forward. Over the near-term, increases in energy prices are siphoning purchasing power of both households and businesses to suppliers overseas, leaving less for non-energy goods and services produced here at home. How large that effect will be is hard to predict. The rise in energy prices DATE seems to have damped spending to a limited extent. But the persistence of higher prices may have a cumulating effect on spending, early hints of which might now be showing up in the latest reading on retail sales. In the housing market, prices are unlikely to fall on a national basis, but the increases well above the rise in rents and incomes that we have seen in DATE cannot continue indefinitely, and rising interest rates will probably damp these increases even more. Home building should cool a bit as a result, but perhaps more consequentially, as capital gains on housing slow, households will likely turn to reducing the growth of their consumption out of current income as a way of building assets to finance their children's education, their retirement, and so forth. Finally, economic policy is becoming less expansionary. After the personal tax cuts of DATE and the special incentives for capital spending, fiscal policy will no longer be providing a special impetus to spending. Let me be clear: This is a positive development; the economy does not need this extra boost, and it is time to turn our attention to the need to raise domestic saving to finance the investment that will help us prepare for the coming surge in retirements. On the monetary side, policy is still accommodative and will need to tighten to avoid inflation building up - the source of my \"for a while\" prediction. Even if short-term rates rise gradually, long-term rates probably will increase in a more-normal pattern of response than we have seen over DATE, since the offset provided by declining risk spreads should not be in operation. Risk spreads actually have widened a bit in DATE, perhaps indicating somewhat more caution on the part of lenders. The rise in interest rates will tend to damp investment spending and could inject some added uncertainty into still-settled financial market conditions. The pace and extent of policy adjustment will depend critically on the inflation outlook, so let me turn to that next. Inflation Consumer price inflation - both total and core - rose somewhat in DATE. Much of the increase in total inflation, but not all, reflected the upward movement of energy prices. Core inflation, which abstracts from food and energy price changes and better reflects underlying price pressures over time, also rose. The increase in core inflation reflected a reversal of some of the factors that had temporarily lowered it in DATE and it also was elevated in the first half of DATE by the pass-through of increases in the prices of energy, commodities, and other imports. Core inflation shifted down in the second half of DATE, providing evidence and assurance that an inflationary spiral was not under way. More recently, we have seen some hints that inflation pressures could be intensifying. Greater price increases have been most evident for goods at earlier stages of production with an uptick in prices for commodities and other materials, for energy, and for non-energy imports. A number of our business contacts across the nation report greater success in passing these cost increases through to customers, including other business customers. Judging from DATE of data, which is always risky, consumers may also be experiencing a slightly faster rate of increase in prices, even excluding the effects of rising energy prices. The direct contribution of rising commodity, energy, and other import prices to consumer inflation is likely to lessen considerably, however. Commodity price increases have slowed; the dollar has flattened out in DATE, which should damp import price increases; and, if they conform to the expectations implicit in futures markets, oil prices should level off and then drop back a bit. But the indirect effects of these sorts of price increases are still a potential concern. To contain inflation pressures, upward adjustments to the levels of these prices must not get built into higher inflation expectations. A rise in inflation expectations would induce people to seek protection against an expected erosion of their purchasing power by raising prices and wages even faster. The evidence regarding inflation expectations has been mixed. Since DATE, expectations of inflation over DATE or so have risen notably. However, surveys and readings from financial markets indicate that expectations for inflation rates DATE out remain stable; in fact they have not changed materially for DATE. People apparently view the near-term changes in inflation as temporary, perhaps associated with rising energy prices. Given that perspective, they are less likely to change their behavior in labor and product markets in ways that perpetuate short-term variations in inflation. Over time, both inflation and inflation expectations will be determined not by adjustments of particular prices but by fundamental factors - the competitive environment in labor and product markets that in turn reflects the extent of resource utilization, and the pace of productivity growth and its effect on costs. The recent news on both fronts suggests that inflation pressures will remain contained, but substantial uncertainty surrounds that outlook. As I noted earlier, resource utilization has risen substantially as the economy has expanded. Naturally, as the margin of underutilized labor and capital is drawn down, some resources - particular skills in labor markets and certain goods and services - come into short supply. But, judging from aggregate measures of wages and labor compensation, the economy is still operating a little below its long-run sustainable level of production. The growth of compensation in DATE was not much different from that in DATE; some measures registered a little faster growth, some a little slower. These flat compensation gains occurred along with an erosion of purchasing power from rising energy prices and faster increases in the productivity of workers in DATE that, all else being equal, would tend to push up the rate of wage inflation. The fact that compensation gains did not rise under these circumstances suggests that slack in markets provided a countervailing influence, and the utilization of labor could increase at least a little more without creating extensive shortages that would prompt ever-increasing rates of growth of compensation and prices. The amount of labor available to be put back to work as the economy expands is determined not only by the demand for labor but also by the response of its supply. In this regard, we are struggling to understand a major surprise. Despite the recent improvements in job prospects, the percentage of the population either working or looking for work - that is the labor force participation rate - has not yet risen from its recessionary lows. Apparently, the demand for workers has been strong enough to allow many of those actively looking for jobs to find them but not strong enough to pull people back into the labor force who may have dropped out - perhaps for early retirement or additional schooling. Also, some of the trends that we had been seeing for some time - such as the rising participation rate of women - may have recently downshifted, irrespective of the strength of labor demand. The unusual behavior of labor force participation will present a challenge to policymakers. If the workers who dropped out of the labor force during the recession begin returning to it in substantial numbers over DATE, then considerable gains in output and employment will be associated with little further tightening of the labor market and limited pressures on costs and prices. If, in contrast, the labor market attachment of those out of the labor force is weak, then they will be less likely to seek jobs, which will mean that robust gains in output and employment could be associated with greater scarcity and an appreciable step-up in labor cost pressures. The productivity of labor is another source of uncertainty about how fast the economy can grow on a sustained basis. However, swings in productivity growth are extremely difficult to predict. Productivity growth was very strong through the first half of DATE, partly because of delayed efficiency gains from the capital goods boom of DATE. One implication of these productivity gains was that, for much of the current expansion, businesses were able to meet increasing sales with management efficiencies rather than with a large number of new hires. Another implication was that unit labor costs of businesses fell, even as the economy was gathering momentum. In the latter half of DATE, the growth of TIME slowed, giving a boost to unit labor costs after DATE of declines. Those increases were not large, however, and productivity growth seems to have increased at a good clip in the first quarter of DATE. A limited slowdown in productivity growth would not be a major concern. The margin of prices over unit labor costs is high by historical standards, and firms should be able to absorb some increases in labor costs without passing them on in prices. Not that firms would do so voluntarily, of course, but they could be forced to by a competitive economic environment characterized by good profit opportunities. However, a more substantial and permanent slowdown in productivity growth would put continuing upward pressure on costs that firms eventually would need to recover by raising prices more quickly. To some extent, though, the monetary policy response to slower productivity growth also depends on whether or not these changes take businesses and workers by surprise. If they do, demand might also be reduced as capital investment looked less profitable and as households cut back on consumption to match their lower expected earnings over time. Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe some of these critical determinants of inflation - slack in the economy, the intentions of people not in the labor force, or structural productivity growth. We infer them indirectly by analyzing information on costs, prices, compensation, profit margins, and levels of capital and labor utilization compared with history. When the economy is in the early stages of an expansion, these inferences are relatively easy, and we can be confident that aberrations from expectations will soon reverse. That is not where we are now. The unemployment rate is close to what some economists believe to be its lowest sustainable level; capacity utilization in manufacturing is moving closer to its long-term average level; and unit labor costs have begun to creep higher. At this time, the odds are that inflation pressures are contained and will remain so. The behavior of labor compensation, the height of profit margins, and still-strong productivity growth all suggest that workers and businesses continue to face very competitive market conditions and that cost increases will remain in check. But in the current circumstances, we need to be vigilant for signs of persistent upward pressure on costs, a marked tightening of labor and product markets, a reduction in global discipline on domestic pricing decisions, or increases in inflation expectations - especially expectations of price increases over the longer run. Over time, of course, it is monetary policy, conducted while taking account of these indicators of cost and price pressures, that determines the rate of inflation. And that brings me to my last topic. Monetary policy As I already noted, monetary policy is still accommodative, and favorable financial conditions have contributed importantly to solid growth and rising levels of resource utilization. But, over time, this policy stance will not be consistent with keeping inflation down. Interest rates need to rise to forestall a buildup of imbalances between aggregate demand and potential supply that would threaten to raise inflation and undermine stability. The FOMC has said that it believes it can remove policy accommodation gradually. That strategy should be successful if, as I have outlined, growth ahead is moderate and inflation pressures are contained. Such a strategy has advantages. Importantly, the gradual approach should enable us to better gauge the ongoing effects of our actions in an uncertain world - give us more opportunities to assess the effects of past increases in rates when we know that those effects can vary and will occur with a lag - and hence to calibrate our actions better to the needs of the economy. Moreover, to date, announcing that we expect to remove accommodation at a measured pace has not materially impeded market participants from responding meaningfully to incoming data, primarily by extending the anticipated series of gradual rate increases when these data suggested the potential for greater inflation pressures. But I would like to underline an important message from TIME of our most recent meeting that were released DATE. The path of interest rates is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end, which is fulfilling our mandate for maximum employment and stable prices. A measured pace of rate increases is our best guess, for now, of what will accomplish these objectives. But that guess is conditional and contingent on our expectations that the economy will evolve roughly along the lines I have described. Communicating our expectations for policy has been unusual for us. In my view, when it is possible, such communication should help to align expectations better with reality and thereby improve pricing in asset markets and the effectiveness of policy. Some observers have objected because they think our words have removed too much uncertainty from markets, encouraging people to take financial positions that they will regret eventually and, by holding down long-term interest rates, work at cross purposes with firming policy. I believe the performance of the economy, rather than our words, has shaped expectations beyond the very near term. I hope I have conveyed the uncertainties in the outlook and the conditionality of our policy expectations; I know that many of my colleagues have been doing the same thing, and market participants should understand the nature of the chances they are taking. Markets price best if they take account not only of the most likely outcome but also of the risks of alternative developments - that is how we behave in central banking. We central bankers are by nature a gloomy lot, trained to focus on what could go wrong; avoiding really bad outcomes helps to shape our policy, and a dose of central banker-like risk assessment is also good advice for investors. A time will come when we cannot provide guidance about our policy intentions because we ourselves will not be confident about the strategy that will be needed. Even then, indicating the uncertainty of policymakers and our assessment of the major threats to sustained good economic performance might prove helpful to the public. In the meantime, all should understand that the guidance we do provide cannot and will not deflect us from changing our strategy whenever we believe doing so to be necessary to meet our objectives.",

                  "Donald L Kohn: The economic outlook Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Atlanta Rotary Club, Atlanta, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to fill in for Jack Guynn DATE to discuss the economic outlook for DATE. Those are big shoes to fill. Jack played a prominent and constructive role in the Federal Reserve System, as I know he did in the Atlanta community, bringing his vast experience and uncommonly good sense to bear on a wide variety of important policy issues. As we enter DATE, the current economic expansion is now DATE. Although it got off to a slow start, the expansion was quite strong from DATE through DATE. Over that period, a good deal of the slack in our nation's utilization of resources was taken up, and the unemployment rate reached its lowest level in DATE. At the same time, however, core inflation - that is, inflation without potentially volatile food and energy prices - as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, moved up from less than NUM-NUM/NUM percent to about NUM-NUM/NUM percent. To safeguard the gains made over DATE in the achievement of price stability and to promote sustained economic expansion, the Federal Reserve in DATE began removing the considerable monetary accommodation it had earlier put in place. More recently, led by a sharp pullback in housing activity, economic activity decelerated in DATE to a pace that was probably a bit below the long-term rate of growth in our nation's productive capacity. At the same time, decreases in energy prices have substantially reduced overall consumer price inflation of late, and core inflation has showed signs of slowing. My expectations for DATE quite naturally rest on an assessment of how recent trends are likely to play themselves out. How long will the decline in housing activity hold back overall economic growth? What about spillovers from housing to other sectors? What are we to make of the recent weakness in manufacturing activity? Will the recent good news on inflation persist? Before venturing some guesses on these questions, I need to issue two caveats. First, events will probably unfold differently than currently seems likely, and the range of uncertainty around any forecast is considerable. That uncertainty does not, however, diminish the value of having and discussing an outlook. Monetary policy must be based on our best estimate of future developments, and the effectiveness of policy is aided when the public understands the outlook of policymakers. But the uncertainty does underscore the value of monitoring the incoming information closely, as we always do, and of being prepared to adjust our expectations accordingly. Second, the views that I will express DATE are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).NUM Economic activity The deceleration in economic activity in DATE was concentrated in the housing and motor vehicle sectors and in the production of related materials and supplies. The slowing of activity has been most acutely felt in the real estate market, where the sales of new and existing homes contracted sharply beginning in DATE. Residential construction has slowed dramatically as well. As of DATE, single-family housing starts had fallen about NUM percent from their peak in DATE. Tentative signs have begun to emerge that the housing market may be stabilizing. Home sales appear to have flattened out since DATE, mortgage applications have been increasing, and consumers' perceptions of homebuying conditions, as reported in the Michigan survey, have improved. Nonetheless, even if the demand for housing is leveling off, housing activity may not yet have found a floor, given the sizable overhang of unsold houses. Uncertainty about where we stand in the housing cycle remains considerable. In part, that is because this housing downturn has differed from some of those in the past in important ways. It was not triggered by a restrictive monetary policy and high interest rates; indeed, relatively low intermediate and long-term interest rates are helping to support the stabilization of this sector. But the current contraction in housing did follow an unusually large run-up in sales and construction and, even more so, in prices relative to the returns on other financial and real assets. Our uncertainty about what pushed home prices and sales to those elevated levels raises questions about how the market will adjust now that expectations of the rate of house price appreciation are being trimmed. And changes in the organization of the construction industry, with activity more concentrated in the hands of large, publicly traded corporations, may also affect the dynamics of prices and activity in response to the inventory overhang. In my own judgment, housing starts may be not very far from their trough, but the risks around this outlook still are largely to the downside. Although house prices nationally have decelerated noticeably and appear to have fallen in some markets, they are still high relative to rents and interest rates. Building permits decreased substantially again in DATE, and inventories of unsold homes have only started to edge lower. We also do not know whether the possible stabilization that seems to be taking hold would be immune to a rise in longer-term interest rates should term premiums increase or the federal funds rate fail to follow the downward path currently built into market expectations. Even if starts stabilize at close to current levels, those levels are sufficiently low that overall construction activity would remain a negative for the growth of economic activity in DATE. While the downturn in housing was steepening during DATE, domestic producers of cars and light trucks slashed output in an effort to reduce their elevated inventories, particularly of light trucks (minivans, SUVs, and pickups). In DATE, light motor vehicles were assembled at the slowest pace in DATE. However, production rebounded in DATE, and, with inventories having come down from their highs DATE, available DATE schedules suggest that vehicle manufacturers anticipate maintaining the pace of assemblies during DATE at about the average rate in DATE and DATE. Thus, with sales reasonably well maintained through DATE, the drag from this sector's inventory correction should be ending. Although much of the weakness in industrial production toward DATE can be readily traced to the housing and motor vehicle sectors, production in other manufacturing industries also softened from DATE through DATE, and this development raised concerns that the deceleration in economic activity was becoming more broadly based. Some of the industries reporting lower output DATE included those that produce intermediate goods for the housing and motor vehicle sectors, but others have only tenuous links to those two sectors. Evidently, other industries have experienced a small buildup of inventories, prompting production adjustments. These inventory and production developments may reflect in part a slowing in the growth of business capital spending that has become evident in recent data on orders and shipments of equipment other than high-tech and transportation equipment. In my view, however, what we are seeing in the recent information on factory output and capital spending is not the leading edge of general economic weakness but instead an adjustment to a sustained pace of expansion that, necessarily, is less rapid than that from DATE to DATE. A number of indicators continue to suggest that economic activity outside the housing and motor vehicle sectors is likely to post continuing healthy gains over DATE. Although several regional manufacturing surveys have suggested that the weakness in factory production extended into DATE, the national purchasing managers' survey rose a notch DATE. Prices of many industrial commodities are typically sensitive to developments in the manufacturing sector, and these prices generally remain firm, as is consistent with sustained demand here and abroad. More broadly, DATE employment report suggested no signs of cumulating weakness either in manufacturing or private service-producing industries. New job creation has remained relatively brisk in DATE; over DATE, private businesses added an average of NUM,NUM jobs to payrolls each DATE - only a little below the pace of hiring DATE. And the unemployment rate remained in the neighborhood of NUM-NUM/NUM percent. On the whole, businesses seem to be reasonably upbeat. The Reserve Bank Districts, including Atlanta, report that most firms are anticipating good gains in sales over DATE. The DATE economic forecast of the Institute for Supply Management, released in mid-DATE, was optimistic - perhaps surprisingly so in light of the recent slowdown in industrial activity. Respondents indicated that capital spending in DATE would increase at a robust pace similar to that for all of DATE. That businesses are beginning DATE with a positive outlook is not surprising: Profits have been high, encouraging business expansion, and external funding for capital projects remains readily available on favorable terms. And as I noted, firms in their hiring decisions seem to be acting on plans to increase output. Most importantly, the data we have in hand suggest that consumer demand for nonhousing goods and services has been well maintained. The retail sales report for DATE was strong across the board, and surveys of consumer confidence show that, in the final DATEs of DATE, households' views about business conditions and about their financial situations improved noticeably. Spending and attitudes have been supported over DATE in part by solid gains in household income and employment. One caution is that some of the recent buoyancy in household attitudes and strength in consumer demand also may reflect the unwinding of earlier increases in gasoline prices, in which case part of the strong gain in spending in DATE may be transitory. Another cautionary note is that the strength in consumer spending throughout DATE received a considerable boost from the earlier rise in household wealth. In the wake of the current slowdown in house price gains, I expect that, over time, households will find it necessary to build their net worth by holding back on consumption, and thus, consumer spending will rise a little less rapidly than income for a while. I do not anticipate that the gap between the growth rates in consumption and income will be large, however, and I believe that the recent data on consumer spending provide some very tentative evidence that the cooling of the housing market will have a limited effect on other forms of spending. Ongoing gains in household consumption and in business capital spending to meet that expected demand and to take advantage of the cost-saving benefits of new technology form the foundation for a moderate pace of economic activity going forward. Continued solid economic expansion among our major trading partners should also provide support to production here at home. To be sure, as I already noted, a low level of housing starts and production adjustments in some manufacturing industries will remain a drag on growth in output in the near term, but these effects will wane during the first half of DATE as excess inventories are worked off. When this process is completed, the rate of economic growth should pick up to something in the neighborhood of the growth rate of the economy's potential. Inflation I believe that a path for output like the one that I have just described is likely to be associated with a gradual decline in core inflation from the elevated levels of DATE and DATE. Importantly, measures of long-term inflation expectations are no higher than they were before the rise in core inflation. In addition, some of that earlier price acceleration probably resulted from the pass-through of sharp increases in energy prices in the first half of DATE that have been partly reversed; increases in rents and imputed rents for owner-occupied housing may ease back as a portion of the oversupply of homes for sale is shifted into the rental market; and a period of below-trend economic growth should relieve some pressures on labor and product markets. Certainly, the recent data on consumer prices have been encouragingly consistent with the downward tilt to inflation that the FOMC has been expecting. However, we need to be cautious about extrapolating trends from a couple of DATEs of data. The data themselves are noisy - subject to DATE-to-DATE variations that are unrelated to more-persistent developments. And we need to recognize that some of the very recent disinflation may represent one-time influences. Energy costs have moved down markedly in DATE, and those declines have fed through to prices for a number of intermediate goods and probably for some final goods as well. But futures markets anticipate that prices of crude oil will increase gradually, which suggests that, once the adjustment to the current level plays out, energy prices will no longer work to restrain total and core inflation. And if a portion of the weakness in goods prices reflects efforts by producers to forestall or correct inventory imbalances, that restraint on pricing will dissipate as firms' corrective actions take effect. So, despite the recent favorable price data, I believe it is still too early to relax our concerns about whether the run-up in price pressures in DATE DATE of last year is truly unwinding and whether it is unwinding rapidly enough to forestall a pickup in inflation expectations. Even with the opening of some slack in the manufacturing sector and in homebuilding, labor markets generally seem to have stayed fairly tight, with the unemployment rate at only NUM-NUM/NUM percent. Although recent data indicate that labor costs were not rising as rapidly in DATE as first estimated, labor compensation does appear to have increased more quickly over DATE than over DATE. DATE increase in compensation also appears to have outpaced overall consumer price inflation. That development in and of itself does not necessarily indicate an increase in inflationary pressures, especially if it represents a process in which real compensation begins to catch up with the rapid increases in labor productivity DATE. What would be problematic would be a pickup in the growth of nominal TIME labor compensation that was passed through to prices over DATE, or one that was not matched, over a sustained period, by a comparable pickup in the growth of productivity. Eventually, the resulting faster growth of unit labor costs would pose a serious threat to price stability. Core inflation is still higher than it was DATE, and, as I noted, some of the very recent decline may result from one-time changes in relative prices rather than an easing in underlying inflation pressures. A very gradual decline in the trend rate of inflation continues to be the most likely outcome, but that path is still by no means assured, and in my judgment such a decline remains critically important to the sustained prosperity of the U.S. economy. In sum, conditions appear to be in place for DATE for the U.S. economy, one marked by growth that is moderate and sustainable and by inflation that will be lower than DATE. The economy appears to be weathering the downturn in housing with limited collateral effects, and inflation appears to be easing with the aid of lower energy prices, well-anchored inflation expectations, and competitive labor and product markets. I am a central banker to my core, so I know that somewhere, somehow, something will go wrong, but you will have to rely on the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to explain to you DATE just what happened and what the implications are for DATE.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Economic outlook and developments in mortgage markets Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Eller College of Management Distinguished Speaker Series, Tucson, Arizona, DATE.    To begin, I would like to thank Dean Portney and everyone at the Eller College of Management here at The University of Arizona for the invitation to speak TIME. I know that this audience includes both experienced business leaders as well as students preparing to apply the knowledge they have learned in the classroom to the real world. Accordingly, my remarks will first touch on the economic outlook. Then, I will offer some thoughts on the challenges facing consumers as they navigate DATE's changing mortgage loan market. Economic outlook Economic activity slowed in the middle part of DATE. After rising at an DATE rate of NUM-NUM/NUM percent over DATE, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an DATE rate of NUM percent in the second quarter of DATE. Real GDP growth in the second half of DATE slowed after accounting for some measurement difficulties in the automotive sector. Despite the recent slowing in output, however, resource utilization remains relatively high by historical standards and thus continues to be a potential source of upward pressure on inflation. In the aftermath of the DATE recession, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased monetary policy substantially. However, the degree of easing in place in DATE and DATE was clearly unsustainable. Since mid-DATE, the FOMC has gradually moved monetary policy from an accommodative stance to a more neutral position. As a consequence, the elements now appear to be in place for some easing of resource utilization rates over DATE and a reduction in inflationary pressures. However, substantial uncertainty surrounds the near-term outlook. In determining the future path of interest rates, the FOMC will be guided by the incoming data on both output and prices, so let's begin by reviewing recent developments. Economic activity The slowdown in the growth of real GDP since DATE largely reflects a cooling of the housing market: Sales of both new and existing homes dropped sharply after their peak in DATE, the inventory of unsold homes has soared, and the number of single-family and multifamily housing starts has fallen nearly NUM percent since the beginning of DATE. At the same time, homes are appreciating more slowly and in some markets prices are even declining. Nonetheless, a variety of factors should help limit any remaining contraction in housing demand. For example, despite the NUM-NUM/NUM percentage point increase in short-term interest rates over DATE, the interest rate on a DATE fixed-rate mortgage has increased only about NUM/NUM percentage point, and borrowing costs continue to be relatively low. The ongoing growth in employment and real incomes and the recent increase in the stock market wealth of households should also support the demand for housing. Indeed, the latest data on home sales and consumer homebuying attitudes suggest that the demand for housing may be stabilizing. While much of the downshift in the housing market appears to have occurred already, some further softening in housing starts may yet lie ahead as the inventory of unsold homes is reduced to appropriate levels. That said, it is encouraging that the recent weakness in residential construction does not appear to have spilled over to other sectors. For instance, employment has been growing nicely in nonresidential construction, even as it has shrunk in the residential sector. In addition, consumer confidence currently stands a good bit above its long-run average and consumption is still being fueled by past house-price gains, which raised household wealth. This contrasts with previous slowdowns in the housing market, which have typically coincided with widespread economic weakness. Although the slowdown in the housing market has so far done little to reduce consumer outlays, other factors do appear to have had a damping effect. In particular, consumption likely was restrained DATE by the rise in energy prices, which took a large bite out of household budgets. The rise in energy prices over DATE has also affected the auto sector, most notably by reducing the demand for gas-guzzling automobiles, such as sport-utility vehicles and trucks. As a result of this decreased demand and other factors, inventories of these types of vehicles rose in the second half of DATE. In response, domestic automakers cut production. However, the latest data on auto sales and scheduled new-vehicle production suggest that the drag from the inventory correction in this sector may be easing. Offsetting influences on consumption should support continued growth of consumer spending. The slowing in the appreciation of house prices will likely reduce the impetus to consumer spending from this source, while recent increases in stock market values, declines in energy prices and strong employment and wage growth should spur consumption. In the business sector, spending on nonresidential construction has been particularly robust. Expenditures on drilling and mining structures have increased rapidly in response to high prices for natural gas and crude oil. Investment in other types of structures, such as offices and commercial buildings, has also been strong. Data for DATE and DATE indicate that although the growth rate of nonresidential investment moderated substantially in the fourth quarter of DATE, it still remained healthy by historical standards. Spending on equipment and software grew quite rapidly from mid-DATE to mid-NUM, but appears to have advanced at a substantially slower pace in the second half of DATE. The recent stepdown in the growth of business sales likely had a damping influence on capital spending, and, in fact, business sentiment has moved down in DATE. However, some backlog of unfilled orders for capital goods such as industrial machinery and other types of heavy equipment remains, which should help support spending in the near term. Moreover, the demand for information technology equipment is likely to be well maintained, in part because of the recent introduction of a new generation of microprocessing chips and more-efficient large servers. Current financial conditions are also supportive of business spending. Corporate balance sheets are strong and flush with cash, profits are strong, and broad stock price indexes are up appreciably since the beginning of DATE. At the same time, yield spreads on corporate bonds across the ratings spectrum have been low, supported by the strong balance sheets and robust profits. Inflation What are the implications of current economic activity on inflation prospects? Consumer prices excluding food and energy accelerated through DATE - the core inflation rate was NUM percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of DATE, up from NUM percent for DATE before.NUM The more recent DATE readings have been more favorable - core prices rose NUM percent over the twelve months through last DATE, only a touch higher than the NUM percent rise over DATE, and this TIME's latest figures on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) suggest that this pattern continued into DATE. Nevertheless, the risk to inflation continues to be on the upside until we see further confirmation in this trend toward moderation. In thinking about the macroeconomic consequences of inflation, it makes sense to look at the core rate, which excludes the prices of energy and food, when the focus is on the short run. This is because temporary shocks to food and energy prices typically don't translate into changes in inflationary pressure. However, if these shocks persist, they may have an effect on core inflation and, more generally, on the economic behavior of households and businesses. Core inflation can be affected when the price changes are propagated along the production chain - say from oil prices to the prices of chemicals and ultimately to the prices of goods made with those chemicals. In addition, shocks to food and energy prices may affect inflation expectations. Thus, we also pay attention to broader measures of inflation. All things considered, the scene appears to be set for a deceleration in prices. One contributing factor is likely to be the slowing in economic activity I already discussed, which should ease the overall pressure on resources. Another important factor affecting the inflation outlook is household and business expectations for inflation. As best we can judge, inflation expectations appear to be well contained: Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, based on surveys and on a comparison of yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt, have remained within the ranges in which they have fluctuated in DATE. Finally, the recent decline in energy prices, if sustained, should reduce cost pressures along the production chain. But a decline in the inflation rate is not assured. Outside of the housing and automotive sectors, growth remains sound and labor markets remain tight, especially for skilled workers. The unemployment rate began to decline in the second half of DATE and by the fourth quarter of DATE stood at a relatively low NUM-NUM/NUM percent. With labor markets comparatively tight by historical standards, unit labor costs have accelerated over DATE, and firms may pass on some of these higher costs to consumers. However, strong business profit margins, which are currently well above their historical averages, could act as a shock absorber if cost strains were to intensify. All told, in my judgment, inflation appears poised to decelerate in DATE as energy prices stabilize and resource pressures ease. But the risks to that outlook seem tilted toward the upside. The Federal Reserve and consumer protection My remarks on the economic outlook discussed developments in housing markets, but now I would like to delve into a specific area of mortgage lending: consumer awareness and understanding of changes in mortgage markets. Given its role as the central bank, a banking supervisor, and a consumer protection regulator for financial services, the Federal Reserve takes a multifaceted approach to understanding the consumer financial services market. Thus, we recognize the importance of homeownership in building household wealth and we monitor the safety and soundness of mortgage underwriting practices. We also write regulations that help ensure consumers understand the characteristics of financial services and products and that they receive the protections available for these services and products. Since DATE, Congress has enacted several laws to ensure that consumers receive comprehensive information and fair treatment in a broad range of financial transactions. These laws protect consumers in transactions involving credit and debit card accounts; automated teller machine transactions and other electronic fund transfers; deposit account activities; automobile leases; mortgages and home equity loans; and lines of credit and other unsecured credit. Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve a considerable role in ensuring that consumers are protected under these laws. For example, the Federal Reserve writes rules to implement the Truth in Lending Act, which Congress enacted to ensure that consumers receive clear information about credit terms and costs. The Federal Reserve is also responsible for rules that implement fair lending laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in credit transactions. In addition, we work with other federal agencies to write joint rules, for example, to ensure that consumers' financial privacy is protected. The Federal Reserve also examines state member banks and foreign banking organizations and exercises its umbrella supervisory authority with respect to bank and financial holding companies to address compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve is committed to vigorous enforcement of those laws. Further, the Federal Reserve develops consumer education materials, recognizing that well-educated consumers are better able to protect themselves in financial transactions. Clearly, to choose wisely from the variety of products and providers available, consumers must have the financial knowledge to navigate DATE's increasingly complex financial services marketplace. For example, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision just revised the Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages (CHARM) to include additional information about nontraditional mortgage products. The CHARM booklet is an important means for delivering information about alternative adjustable rate mortgage products to consumers because creditors are required to provide a copy of the booklet to each consumer who receives an application for an ARM. Because the booklet is provided at this early stage in the process, it can be useful in encouraging consumers to ask brokers and lenders the right questions to decide if this type of loan is right for them. The booklet explains such features as payment shock and negative amortization. It also provides numerical examples that illustrate how consumers' payments can change and how their loan balances may increase over the term of the loan. The Federal Reserve also published a consumer education brochure titled: Interest-Only Mortgage Payments and Option-Payment ARMs --Are They for You? The brochure is designed to assist consumers who are shopping for a mortgage loan and is available in printed form and in electronic form on the Federal Reserve's website, along with other consumer mortgage information Finally, the Federal Reserve engages in numerous outreach activities and conducts research to help us better understand the financial services market and consumer behavior and the best approaches for assisting consumers. We sponsor consumer and industry surveys, hold public hearings, discuss issues with our Consumer Advisory Council, and conduct consumer focus groups and other types of consumer testing, in addition to considering the public comments on proposed rules. Recently, the Federal Reserve has engaged in outreach to a broad group of interested parties regarding nontraditional mortgages. Our Consumer Advisory Council, which includes consumer advocates and industry representatives, provided us with valuable information about nontraditional mortgage products during development of the interagency guidance. In addition, the Federal Reserve held a series of four public hearings on home-equity lending during DATE. One of the principal purposes of the hearings was to gather information to inform the Federal Reserve's review of its Truth in Lending rules. A significant portion of the hearings was devoted to discussing nontraditional mortgage products, and in particular, whether consumers receive adequate information about these products. The hearings explored research on consumer behavior in shopping for mortgage loans and included discussions about the challenges in designing disclosures to more effectively communicate loan terms and risks to consumers. We will consider this information in developing plans and recommendations for revising the Truth in Lending rules, which require all creditors to provide consumers with disclosures about loan terms. Many financial products are very sophisticated credit transactions, and the disclosures describing them are also complex and highly technical; which can be difficult for some consumers to understand. To address this issue, the Federal Reserve is focusing in a more rigorous way on determining the effectiveness of disclosures. We conduct extensive consumer testing to determine what information is most important to consumers, when it is most useful for consumers to receive it, what language and formats work best, and how disclosures can be simplified, and better organized, to reduce complexity and information overload. To that end, the Federal Reserve uses design consultants to assist in developing model disclosures that are most likely to be effective in communicating vital credit information to consumers. The Federal Reserve also uses consumer testing to assist in developing model disclosure forms, and we draw from research done by respected behavioral economists. For example, when considering some regulatory changes related to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Federal Reserve used consumer focus group testing to develop useful and timely disclosures for employees whose pay is received in the form of a payroll card (a card that works much like a traditional debit card). The Federal Reserve is also engaging in extensive consumer testing of credit card disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act, and has found those interactions with consumers instructive in revising disclosures to be more meaningful to consumers in DATE's complex and highly prolific credit card market. Mortgage lending I now want to discuss developments in mortgage loan products. DATE, the federal financial institution regulators issued supervisory guidance on nontraditional mortgages. These mortgages include interest-only loans that allow consumers to defer the payment of principal and make only interest payments for an initial period. They also include adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with a payment option, allowing consumers to make \"minimum payments\" of less than the accrued interest. The result of such a loan structure is that the amount owed can increase even as the borrower makes payments, a circumstance known as negative amortization. Over time, the payments for these loans must be adjusted upward to catch up with fully indexed interest rates and/or paydowns (amortization) of the balance owed, often significantly, which sometimes results in what some call \"payment shock.\" Sometimes borrowers can refinance out of these loans, but that may cost them a serious prepayment penalty and reduce the amount of equity that they have built up in their home. The complexity of these products contrasts with traditional DATE fixed-rate loans, in which consumers have equal DATE payments that are sufficient to cover the accrued interest and pay down the principal, and with which borrowers are generally familiar. To be clear, nontraditional mortgages certainly serve a useful purpose when used appropriately. These products have increased the range of financing options available to consumers and have grown in popularity over DATE. Some consumers may benefit from these products' more flexible payment options. For example, consumers with seasonal or irregular income or who expect their incomes to increase are more likely to be able to absorb the increase in payments in the near term of the loan. But nontraditional mortgage loan products can be complex and may not be appropriate for everyone. Concerns have been raised that consumers are not getting clear and balanced information about the risks and features of interest-only and payment option ARMs. These products have been advertised and promoted based on their initially low DATE payments when compared with traditional mortgage products. By focusing on initial DATE payments without appropriate understanding of how the payments can vary over time or that minimum payments may actually increase the amount owed, many consumers have become financially overextended. Mortgage lenders are no longer limited in the size of their mortgage lending activities by the amount of available funding on their balance sheets. Mortgages are now routinely sold to institutions who securitize mortgages by aggregating them with other loans into pools. These mortgage-backed securities are held by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and other investors both in the United States and internationally. This diversity of funding sources makes it possible for lenders to structure products that meet the various needs of borrowers, and still be able to mitigate the risks they may take on if the loan were held on their balance sheets. As a result, the mortgage lending industry continually adapts to consumer requirements and investor preferences for loan securitization structures. A mortgage is generally the largest financial obligation a consumer enters into. The initial costs, the cost over the life of the mortgage, and the costs to prepay and refinance can be significant. Having a wide variety of mortgage types assists consumers in finding a way to finance the purchase of a home that best meets their own financial and lifestyle requirements. But the growing complexity of products makes it a bigger challenge for borrowers to understand the characteristics of competing products. This is where shopping among a couple of lenders and a couple of different products can help the consumer understand the features of different loan types. When looking at different loan products, consumers should consider how long they plan to own their home, expectations of future income, their stage of life cycle, and broader financial obligations in choosing among mortgage alternatives. For example, if consumers want to pay off their mortgages before retirement, they must determine if the DATE payment will fully amortize the loan by the target date. If homeowners plan to move in DATE, then they should compare prepayment penalties, if any, and interest rates among their mortgage alternatives. But some consumers do not actively shop for a lender or a mortgage, and they do not compare loan terms in light of their personal circumstances. Instead they rely on one lender and accept the mortgage loan presented to them. Mortgages that are appropriate for one borrower, however, may create problems for another. For example, some mortgages have low initial interest rates and DATE payments. But increases come later as the \"teaser period\" ends and payments rise to begin pay down of principal. Borrowers whose budgets make the initial payment just manageable may have difficulty meeting these significant jumps in DATE payments and so are at risk of defaulting on their mortgages and losing their home. By shopping among lenders and products, consumers are also better able to determine whether a given loan feature is really an advantage. For example, some lenders have recently been more willing to waive proof of income when making a mortgage. But, they may charge a higher interest rate to cover the risk that the borrower may not be able to afford the mortgage. The customer however may save interest cost by making the effort to provide copies of tax returns and pay stubs. Another example is that some lenders do not require their borrowers to pay their property tax and hazard insurance premiums into an escrow account. Consumers need to ask lenders if their DATE payments will include funds for such an escrow account. If not, borrowers need to separately set aside savings to meet these obligations. Lenders, for their part, should make it possible for consumers to engage in shopping for a mortgage. As I noted, DATE the federal financial institution regulators issued interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage products, which included both a focus on safe and sound lending practices as well as on consumer awareness and consumer protection. The guidance focuses on the responsibility of lenders to provide consumers with clear and balanced information at crucial decision-making points about the benefits and risks of nontraditional mortgage products. Accordingly, the interagency guidance describes recommended practices for financial institutions in communicating with consumers while they are shopping, not just upon submission of an application or at loan consummation. Specifically, the guidance recommends that institutions' promotional materials and descriptions of these products include information about, among other things, potential increases in consumers' payment obligations and the potential consequences of increasing principal loan balances and decreasing home equity. The guidance also recommends that institutions alert consumers to the amount of any prepayment penalty that may be imposed if the consumer refinances the mortgage. Conclusion I hope that my remarks DATE provided a useful snapshot of the current economic outlook. Outside of housing and the automotive sector, the economy is strong and employment is growing. The surge in housing construction that occurred in DATE-NUM was not sustainable, and we are now well along in adjusting housing construction to more comfortable levels. Inflation continues to run at a pace above my comfort level. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to moderate inflation. Monetary policy works with long lags and so the economy is still reacting to our past actions. Given the strong growth in most sectors of the economy, the risks to inflation are still on the upside. In addition to giving some thoughts on the economy, I felt it was useful to offer a summary of the role that the Federal Reserve plays in consumer protection, using the current example of nontraditional mortgages. Clearly, the Federal Reserve believes in promoting consumer awareness and maintaining consumer protection so that users of financial products fully understand those products and their associated risks.",

                  "Donald L Kohn: Economic outlook Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Bankers and Business Leaders Luncheon, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Oklahoma City Branch, Oklahoma, DATE.    I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the business leaders of Oklahoma City. The Federal Reserve has deep roots in this community: The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has had a Branch here since DATE. Consistent with the experience of most other enterprises DATE, the Federal Reserve is having to change the way we do business in response to rapid changes in technology. We can see the effects of these changes on the payment system DATE and all around us as we make and receive payments that depend less and less on the use of checks. To hold down costs, we have been required to reduce the number of our offices delivering payments services to banks, including check and cash operations at Oklahoma City. But closing those operations by no means implies that we are reducing our commitment to the community. Indeed, Tom Hoenig and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City are taking steps to strengthen our roots here. Our most important ties to local communities have never been primarily through the services we deliver to their banks. Rather they are established through the exchange of information between those communities and the Federal Reserve, and the Oklahoma City Branch will remain our eyes and ears in this region. Tom will continue to bring to our policy deliberations the information he gathers from Tyree Minner and his colleagues on the board of directors of the Oklahoma City Branch, from Bob Funk and his colleagues on the head office board, and from many other contacts in the region. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Oklahoma City Branch are increasing their efforts to reach out to this community to make sure that we are listening as effectively as possible to your impressions of the current economic circumstances, to explain our policies, to help educate the public in the use of the increasingly complex financial instruments available to them, and to work with community leaders to identify strategies that will help sustain a vibrant economy. The Board of Governors in Washington strongly supports these efforts by Kansas City and other Reserve Banks to deepen their ties to their communities, and I am pleased to be here as tangible evidence of that support. I thought I would take advantage of this opportunity to discuss the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy. We are at an especially interesting juncture, so this is a good time to take stock of where we are and to peer ahead through the prognosticator's always murky lens. I must emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.NUM On balance, the economy has been performing quite well in DATE, with growth strong and underlying inflation stable despite the considerable rise in energy prices over DATE. I say \"on balance\" because a number of unusual factors have been influencing the pattern of economic activity lately, adding to the normal difficulty of discerning underlying trends from inherently volatile data and other information. These factors include not only DATE devastating hurricanes but also the unusually warm weather in the early part of DATE, which very likely provided a fillip to housing construction and consumer spending. Smoothing through these events, however, the economy has been expanding at a pretty good clip by historical standards--probably an DATE rate of about NUM-NUM/NUM percent since DATE. Several factors have propelled reasonably strong economic growth. A critical element has been supportive financial conditions. Despite the tightening of monetary policy that began in DATE, short-term interest rates were at fairly low levels until recently, and the effects of those low rates have continued to spur household and business spending. In addition, although longer-term yields have moved up notably in DATE, they too have been low by historical standards. Moreover, credit to businesses and households has remained readily available at narrow spreads in markets and on favorable terms and conditions at banks, reflecting, in part, robust earnings and strong balance sheets at businesses along with good performance on outstanding household and business loans. The pace of economic growth in the United States has also been supported by a firming of activity abroad and the associated increases in demand for our exports. Among industrial countries, expansion of output has become more firmly established in both Japan and the euro area, while growth continues at a solid pace in the United Kingdom and Canada. Furthermore, economic growth in most of the emerging economies of Asia has been robust. U.S. exports were disrupted by DATE hurricanes in the Gulf, but smoothing through this volatility, exports appear to have been contributing substantially to the growth of gross domestic product (GDP). Our economy has been able to register this good performance despite rising energy prices. This audience knows well that since DATE the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, for delivery at Cushing, has soared from about $NUM per barrel to nearly $NUM recently. Nonetheless, the rise in energy prices has apparently had only a limited negative effect on the national economy. Energy costs are not nearly as important DATE as they once were. Since DATE, the energy intensity of production in the United States has fallen dramatically; indeed, on an inflation-adjusted basis, it takes roughly half as many Btu of energy to produce a dollar of GDP DATE than it did at the time of the DATE oil crisis. This sharply reduced share of energy costs in total business expenses has likely limited the influence of these costs on profits, on overall consumer prices and real income, and on the economy more generally. A rough estimate puts the reduction in real GDP growth from the increases in energy prices since DATE at between NUM/NUM percent and NUM percent per year. Of course, reactions to higher energy prices are hard to predict, but the measured response of activity over DATE suggests that the most recent price increases will have, at most, only a small effect on economic growth during DATE. The good performance of the economy has led to a further narrowing in the margin of unutilized resources. For example, the Federal Reserve's measure of capacity utilization in manufacturing has moved up NUM percentage points during DATE, to around NUM-NUM/NUM percent, a touch above its longer-run average. Similarly, the unemployment rate has fallen almost NUM/NUM percentage point from DATE to around NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE. Nevertheless, the underlying rate of inflation has remained moderate. Headline inflation, of course, has been boosted by the jump in energy prices. However, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on prices for non-energy goods and services. The inflation rate for prices of consumer goods and services excluding food and energy, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been running a bit under NUM percent, only about NUM/NUM percentage point above its rate DATE before the spurt in energy prices began. Inflation has been restrained, in part, by the margin of slack in labor and product markets that has persisted through much of this period. Another reason for this favorable outcome is that longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. For example, the median expected inflation rate during DATE, as reported in the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, has barely edged up in DATE, even as short-term inflation has been boosted by rising energy prices. Meanwhile, inflation compensation for investors implied by the spreads between the rates on nominal and CPI-indexed Treasury notes at both five- and DATE maturities also has not shown any tendency to move higher on balance. In DATE, declining prices of imports and the threat of import competition have also probably held down costs and prices to a degree. Moreover, increases in compensation costs have generally been modest. To be sure, average TIME earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers have been accelerating in DATE. However, the broadest measures of compensation have not picked up, suggesting that competition in labor markets has been intense. Nonetheless, with labor markets tightening, some pickup in compensation increases for the broad measures would not be surprising. Nor would a pickup necessarily be inflationary, given the very good growth in labor productivity that we have experienced in DATE. Despite the relatively moderate increases in prices and costs that we have observed lately, the capacity utilization rate and the unemployment rate have recently reached zones that on occasion in the past have been associated with the beginnings of upward pressure on inflation. Of course, the past is not always a good guide to the future, in part because a great deal of uncertainty surrounds the relationship of resource utilization and inflation. For instance, we cannot directly observe full capacity of either labor or production resources; consequently, we can never be certain what level of activity represents the full utilization of capacity. In addition, measurement issues aside, the empirical evidence of DATE suggests that the relationship between utilization and inflation can shift over time. Unfortunately, we typically are only imperfectly aware of the changes and their magnitudes in real time. In DATE, that relationship was affected by, among other things, changing trends in the growth rate of productivity and innovations in the structure of labor markets, such as increased use of temporary help supply. These uncertainties mean that we, as policymakers, need to keep not only an open mind about estimates of the economy's potential but also a close eye on the various indicators of costs and prices so that we can recognize incipient price developments and react to them as early as possible. But we also must recognize that, by the time evidence of accelerating prices becomes definitive, containing inflation pressures could entail disruptive economic adjustments. So despite the uncertainties, we must evaluate all the evidence and make our best judgments about the oncoming risks to sustained good economic performance. In the current circumstances, as the Federal Open Market Committee has said, the economic climate appears to be one in which further increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The available evidence suggests that the pace of economic expansion may moderate a little from its average over DATE, keeping resource utilization in line with recent levels. Maintaining economic growth around this pace will likely reflect a balancing of opposing forces. The rise in interest rates we have experienced will tend to restrain demand, offsetting the effects of sustained economic expansion in our trading partners and the reduced drag on U.S. growth from oil prices, assuming that those prices roughly flatten out as participants in futures markets seem to expect. If the past is any guide, the effect of rising interest rates is likely to be felt most visibly in housing markets. The rate for a DATE, fixed-rate mortgage is up NUM basis points from its level in DATE, and DATE adjustable-rate mortgages have risen more than NUM basis points over DATE. In addition, house prices have increased considerably relative to rents, incomes, and returns on alternative assets. Already there have been signs that housing demand has begun to moderate. Sales of both new and existing homes are down substantially from their levels DATE, and information on mortgage applications and pending home sales point to further softening in DATE. With demand slowing, house prices also seem likely to decelerate. Indeed, we are beginning to see hints of moderation in some of the data on housing prices. As a consequence, spending for new housing construction, after contributing nearly NUM/NUM percentage point to overall GDP growth DATE, may not increase much DATE. Moreover, the slowdown in house price increases could well hold back growth in consumption spending on a wide variety of goods and services. The rapid run-up in prices over DATE and hence in household wealth, perhaps combined with the increasing ease of tapping that wealth, probably has been a major reason that households have been saving so little of their current flow of income. As house-price appreciation slows, the personal saving rate likely should begin a gradual ascent. To be candid, however, the behavior of the housing market and the response of spending are among the great uncertainties about the economic outlook. I have sketched a benign scenario of gradual adjustment that lines up very nicely with the Federal Reserve's assessment that overall growth should slow to a sustainable pace. But our ability to predict asset prices is very limited, especially when the trajectory of those prices is shifting, as that of house prices appears to be doing right now. Moreover, we have particular difficulty in assessing how consumers will respond to changes in their perceptions of future capital gains and actual home prices. The housing market and its effects on spending will be among the areas that Tom and I and our colleagues on the FOMC will be monitoring most closely as we try to discern the emerging pattern of economic activity and inflation. At this time, even with housing markets cooling, the fundamentals remain favorable for solid gains over DATE in both consumer spending and business investment. In part, that assessment reflects the sizable increases in employment that we have been seeing over DATE. DATE, the Labor Department reported that payroll employment rose NUM,NUM in DATE. If the growth of aggregate demand moderates as we expect, increases in employment should also slow but still be sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market. Moreover, the gains in wage and salary income associated with those employment increases should provide ongoing support to household spending. The purchasing power of those gains will go further than it has in DATE if, as anticipated in futures markets, energy prices level out. Meanwhile, in the business sector, order books for nondefense capital goods are full, sales prospects appear good, profits have been strong, balance sheets are in healthy shape, and companies are flush with cash. As the growth of consumption eases back a little, so too should the increase in capital spending as firms come to anticipate slower growth in sales. But judging from rising global commodity prices and equity valuations abroad, foreign demand looks to be increasing, and rising exports should offset some of the scaling back of domestic sales prospects. In addition, technological advances will continue to boost demand for capital equipment by reducing its costs and increasing its usefulness in improving efficiency. If, as I anticipate, economic growth moderates a touch and pressures on labor and product markets do not intensify substantially further, I believe that underlying inflation should remain roughly stable. That sanguine picture is reinforced if crude oil prices do, in fact, turn out to be relatively flat over the remainder of DATE. Such a flattening of oil prices would reduce headline inflation directly and would diminish the threat of higher energy prices becoming more deeply embedded in the inflation process by raising inflation expectations. And, to date, inflation expectations have been well anchored. As I have already mentioned, it would not be surprising to see some pickup in TIME compensation, but such an acceleration may not add to price pressures. In DATE's competitive environment, and with profits generally robust, some of the cost increases might well be absorbed in margins. Moreover, further productivity gains should act to damp the effects on overall unit costs. Like all forecasts, this expectation of stable inflation is only the middle of a wide range of possible outcomes. For example, a further spurt in energy and commodity prices could be passed through into core inflation to a greater extent than seems to have been occurring recently; the threat of that outcome probably is especially great when the economy is already operating at a high level. If the economy does not moderate somewhat, pressures on resources will increase, further raising the odds of higher inflation. And as I discussed earlier, historical patterns suggest that resource utilization is already in a zone that at times has been associated with the emergence of inflation pressures. But the risks are not all one-sided. Price and compensation inflation have, in fact, remained moderate at high levels of resource utilization, despite rapid increases in energy and commodity prices, suggesting that some forces not yet fully identified may be helping to keep them contained. Those forces might include robust underlying productivity growth here at home or competition from abroad. It is also possible that the economy could cool more than expected if housing markets weaken quite substantially, consumption is cut back significantly, and as a consequence businesses pare capital spending plans. My job as a policymaker is to work with my colleagues to identify the path of short-term interest rates that has the best chance of realizing that favorable central-tendency forecast of solid growth and continued low inflation. I do not know how much policy firming will be needed to accomplish this objective. My forecast is that the economy is in transition to a sustainable pace of growth, in which case policy likely will be in transition as well. At this juncture, given the apparent strength in demand and the narrowing margin of unused resources, I am focused on making sure that inflation and inflation expectations remain well anchored. A tendency for inflation to move higher would put economic stability and the long-term performance of the economy at risk. Accordingly, for me, the critical indicators in the time ahead will be the ones that signal whether growth is indeed likely to proceed at a sustainable pace and whether inflation remains on a favorable track. This is a judgment my colleagues and I will need to make meeting by meeting as the incoming information--both the data and, critically, the timely feel for developments that we get from the Reserve Banks' contacts in the community--help us assess the paths for the economy and price pressures.",

                  "Donald L Kohn: Business capital spending Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Forecasters Club of New York Luncheon, New York, DATE.    The members of any group calling itself the Forecasters Club don't need an elaborate justification for my focus DATE on business fixed investment. The outlook for business investment is always a key element in any economic forecast. It can be a highly volatile component of aggregate demand, with variations in investment often accounting for a good share of the fluctuations in economic activity. That lesson was demonstrated again in DATE when strength in business investment contributed to the vigorous expansion of DATE, and then a marked and prolonged weakening in capital spending contributed to recession and sluggish growth in DATE and DATE. Business investment also has important implications for the supply side of the economy through its influence on the rate of increase in labor productivity and thus the economy's sustainable level of potential output. DATE, Chairman Bernanke talked to you about investment, laying out a structure for forecasting and using it to comment on the economic outlook. I thought that now would be a propitious moment to revisit the subject. What I would characterize as the standard forecast for DATE and next has the economy slowing a bit to trend. That slowing arises in substantial part from the effects that a cooling in housing markets has on residential construction and on consumption. But, at the same time, the standard forecast sees growth as being supported by a continued robust expansion of business investment. However, the range of views on investment seems a little wider than usual; the variation in large part reflects whether forecasters foresee a resolution of some apparent anomalies in investment behavior observed over DATE. In particular, the weakening in investment in DATE and DATE was larger and lasted longer than many had anticipated, and although investment growth has picked up in DATE, the level of investment has not fully recovered from the earlier weakness. My remarks DATE examine what we have--and have not--learned about this shortfall and what we might expect for business fixed investment over DATE. I must emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.NUM Business fixed investment has risen at a robust DATE rate of nearly NUM percent on average over DATE, and the real level of investment at DATE, $NUM trillion, was nearly NUM percent higher than the peak reached DATE. However, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded nearly NUM percent over DATE. To be sure, the investment peak in DATE was unusually high; still, the nominal share of business fixed investment in GDP, at NUM-NUM/NUM percent at DATE, was well below its DATE average. Of course, comparisons of these simple ratios and growth rates do not account for other influences on investment in the macroeconomic environment, such as interest rates, the prices of capital goods, or the rate of increase in final spending. However, a more rigorous exercise using a standard model favored by many forecasters yields a similar conclusion. Using lagged net investment, changes in business output, and changes in the user cost of capital to predict the level of current net investment, we find that the model did not forecast the plunge in investment in DATE. And, despite its ability to predict recent growth rates reasonably well, a dynamic simulation of such a model starting in DATE indicates that the current level of investment is still considerably lower than expected. To be sure, we would not have expected investment to snap back right away, judging from experience. Still, investment over DATE is showing no signs of returning to the path that we would have expected from historical relationships through DATE. Business financial statements also reflect evidence of restrained business spending behavior. Normally, businesses are heavy net users of savings generated by the rest of the economy. The financing gap--the level of capital spending over the level of internal funds--is a measure of that reliance. But it was close to zero in DATE and DATE and remained unusually low DATE (after adjustment for tax-induced flows of repatriated foreign earnings), which suggests that businesses didn't see enough profitable investment projects to warrant tapping the markets for external financing, even at low long-term interest rates. To be sure, profit margins and cash flow have been high, but that would also seem to be an environment that should encourage expansion. In fact, businesses appear to be using some of their very large holdings of cash for other purposes. Corporations have increased their share repurchases, which hit a record level DATE. They have also increased share retirements through cash-financed mergers and acquisitions, which have been boosted by a surge in buyouts. Evidently, corporate managers view prospective returns from these uses of cash flow as comparing favorably with those from new capital spending projects. The low level of investment has not been unique to the United States. Gross investment in other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was sluggish in DATE of this recovery, and the nominal share of nonresidential fixed investment in GDP in these countries is still barely higher than its twenty-five-year trough in DATE. This pattern persists despite a low cost of capital and ample cash flows in many countries as well as business sentiment that improved markedly DATE. Although real investment in Japan has moved up fairly steadily for DATE, capital spending was weak for DATE as profits were channeled to clean up balance sheets rather than expand productive capacity. Euro-area investment has also languished, in part because of relatively slow growth prospects. In both Japan and the euro area, investment likely also is being curtailed to some extent because of a demographic shift toward a more elderly population: As the share of the population that is of working age declines, the rise in the capital stock needed to equip the labor force decreases. Investment in the East Asian countries is still lower than before the crises of DATE, although investment rates in the region are generally higher than those in advanced economies. Also, lower rates of investment in some of these countries may reflect some shifting of production to China (where investment rates have been quite high in DATE). Ratios and equations are at best only rough guides to the investment that we might expect on the basis of past behavior in similar circumstances. Still, looking across a variety of indicators and a variety of countries, it does appear that the level of investment is unusually low for this stage of the business cycle. A more difficult task is determining why. As we shall see, there are a number of possible explanations, but no single one seems to hold the entire answer. An explanation that has received a great deal of attention is that a capital overhang, usually thought of as concentrated in high-tech equipment, developed in DATE and subsequently has been dragging down investment spending. In DATE, firms invested in high-tech goods at a very rapid pace, spurred at first by plunging prices and robust business output growth and eventually by an apparently overly optimistic view about the returns on those investments. Subsequently, high-tech investment dropped at a double-digit rate in DATE and fell further in DATE. This sharp decline, combined with the high depreciation rates on these types of goods, severely curtailed growth of the capital stock, and any overhang seems likely to have been eliminated relatively quickly. However, desired or optimal capital stocks are notoriously difficult to specify and measure, and hence so are overhangs, even DATE after the episode. Consequently, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the excess capital built up during DATE is restraining investment to some extent DATE. Another possibility is that business investment has been held down in DATE because relative prices of capital goods are no longer falling at the same pace at which they declined in DATE. At least some of the deceleration may reflect a slowing pace of technological improvement--that is, less-rapid downward shifts in the supply curve of capital goods. However, to the extent that these price changes are well measured and our econometric models are well specified, the implications of slower price declines should already be captured by our models. In addition, the effects of less rapidly falling prices on the growth rate of the user cost of capital appears to have been substantially offset over much of this period by declines in real interest rates. Another explanation that received attention in DATE of this decade is that businesses were unusually cautious after the most recent recession in expanding their productive capacity. Both hiring and capital investment lagged the usual recovery pace. One possible source of this caution was said to be questions about the strength and sustainability of the recovery, accentuated by concerns about terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainties. Many periods of recovery have been accompanied by concerns about economic growth and political turmoil. But surveys suggest that managers did experience a prolonged sense of gloom, with measures of sentiment dropping to low levels and staying that way for DATE or two beyond the business cycle trough. However, the economy has been expanding at an above-trend pace for DATE now, and the durability of the recovery should no longer be an issue. Indeed, most surveys of business confidence and capital spending plans have reached, and in some cases exceeded, the levels of DATE. Still another possibility is that conditions created by corporate governance scandals and the regulatory response to those events led firms to hold back on capital spending. The scandals and the market's reaction were said to have contributed to a more conservative attitude toward risk taking. Moreover, complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of DATE may have affected capital spending as firms scrambled to meet the DATE and DATE deadlines. Clearly, compliance costs have been substantial, perhaps diverting funds and attention away from capital spending plans. However, capital spending to update information systems to address the enhanced auditing needs may be offsetting at least a portion of any damping effect the legislation may have had. In any event, the market effects of corporate governance scandals appear to have faded DATE. And, at larger companies, where systems have been adapted to the new requirements, compliance now should be more routine, freeing time and attention to concentrate on business strategy and expansion. If these types of influences have had any restraining effects, they should be receding. Changing replacement cycles are another potential downward influence on the pace of investment. Before DATE, many firms invested in new technologies to replace those not compatible with DATE date change. This effort tended to speed up replacement cycles (and thus depreciation), boosting gross investment at that time. The resulting bunching of purchases may have contributed to the drop-off in investment in DATE as firms with relatively new, efficient capital goods saw less reason to upgrade. Also, during DATE and DATE, anecdotal reports suggested that many firms saw no need to upgrade equipment because no compelling new technology or application had been released, which would have tended to lengthen the replacement cycle. If replacement cycles since then have remained longer than in DATE, firms would respond with a lower level of gross investment. And, anecdotes and surveys suggest that replacement cycles have in fact lengthened in DATE compared with DATE. But the implied drop in the rate of depreciation is much too small to explain the low-investment puzzle. Some have posited that low investment in the United States reflects firms' decisions to meet expanding demand by investing overseas rather than at home. Economic theory suggests that in countries where labor is cheap and abundant, all else equal, we would expect the marginal product of capital to be relatively high, making these economies attractive places in which to invest. Thus, countries such as China ought to be seeing an influx of direct investment. However, the dollar value of U.S. direct investment into China averaged about $NUM billion per year in DATE, much less than NUM percent of domestic investment spending and not enough to be a major influence on investment spending trends. Looking at flows to all developing economies, the share of outward direct investment going to these destinations has been about flat over DATE. Foreign direct investment, as a whole, has been rising relative to domestic investment, but gradually over DATE--a trend that was not picked up in DATE. Clearly, none of these explanations is the sole cause of the relatively restrained level of investment. Most likely, some combination of these factors along with others we have not identified accounted for the sharp decline in investment in DATE and DATE and has contributed to keeping investment spending rising along a lower track subsequently, both domestically and abroad. However, as I noted, several of those factors are of questionable quantitative import, and others no longer seem to provide a rationale for the failure of investment spending to rebound more vigorously. Yet, most indicators in hand do not point to a surge in business fixed investment that will restore the trend derived from earlier relationships. Instead, the latest reads on business spending and intentions point to continued solid growth in capital spending, supported by favorable fundamentals of steady increases in final demand and a relatively damped cost of capital. Over DATE, both orders and shipments of capital equipment (excluding the volatile aircraft category) have continued to move up at roughly the steady pace seen since DATE. Moreover, orders remained above shipments in the first quarter of DATE, leading to another increase in the backlog of orders. In addition, surveys indicate that businesses' capital spending plans and their outlook for sales remain, on balance, in the elevated range that they have occupied for DATE. A slowing in the growth of consumption and residential investment associated with a cooling in the housing market will exert some restraint on capital investment, but business sales should receive some support from improved markets for our exports. Moreover, business spending on structures finally seems to be picking up momentum. The construction data that we have in hand for DATE suggest a bounceback from the anemic growth in spending on nonresidential buildings that has prevailed over DATE. This pickup should persist, responding to the recent declines in office and industrial vacancy rates. And expenditures on drilling and mining structures are likely to remain strong, given the current market expectations for elevated energy prices. Spending on structures should also get a boost DATE from rebuilding in the areas hard hit by DATE's hurricanes. The outlook for solid increases in investment spending has both upside and downside risks associated with it. On the downside, the cooling off that we are currently observing in housing markets could become more severe, and both residential construction and consumer spending could take a larger hit than expected. A substantial slowing in these two categories of final demand would likely induce some businesses to curtail or delay investment projects. On the upside, we cannot say exactly why the level of investment has remained low for DATE, so we certainly cannot rule out a return to previous higher trends. In that regard, we do seem to be seeing a strengthening in global demand, which could signal a more pervasive change in attitudes and expectations. Because capital spending influences not only aggregate demand DATE but also influences aggregate supply and productivity over the medium term, it is a key element of any forecast. The focus in current commentary is mostly on the outlook for housing and consumption, but I suspect that business fixed investment will again play a central role in shaping the path of the economy. The experience of DATE does not seem to have greatly clarified the reasons for the extent of the fall in investment in DATE and DATE and its subsequent failure to return to previous trends. The persisting puzzle has the effect of increasing uncertainty around any projection. But it also suggests the potential for substantial returns to further analysis and research for forecasters, like those in this club and us in the Federal Reserve.",

                  "Mark W Olson: Recent economic experience and outlook Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Fraser Institute Roundtable Luncheon, Toronto, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak to you DATE about my assessment of current economic conditions in the United States and what is required to maintain an economic environment conducive to growth, job creation, and price stability. I should note that my remarks DATE reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System. Commentaries on the economy often focus too heavily on DATE and DATE data. To put DATE's economic performance in a broader context, I would like to step back briefly and touch on some recent economic history. As you know, the latter half of the 1990s was a time of remarkable economic performance, fueled importantly by an investment boom that contributed to rapid growth in labor productivity. However, by DATE, that boom had come to an end, and businesses abruptly curtailed capital spending - particularly for high-tech equipment. The cutback in spending occurred as expectations about the potential profitability of new investment opportunities turned down, and many companies, such as those in the telecommunications sector, found that they had invested too much in equipment and office space during the boom. With the sudden drop-off in business demand, inventories began to pile up, and producers cut production of all types of goods in DATE. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve reduced the target rate for the federal funds rate sharply over the course of DATE to contain the weakness and head off a more serious deterioration following the terrorist attacks in DATE. This monetary policy stance, coupled with stimulative fiscal policy, was generally successful. In contrast to most U.S. recessions since World War II, consumer spending and residential investment were both relatively well maintained during this period. Even as firms cut employment and stock market losses eroded household wealth throughout DATE and DATE, household spending was supported by tax cuts, low inflation, and low interest rates. Consumers took advantage of falling mortgage rates to buy new homes, to refinance their existing mortgage debt, and to tap into their increasing home equity to pay off more expensive debt or to finance spending on other things. As a result, the recession in DATE turned out to be quite shallow, and activity in DATE recovered modestly even though businesses continued to cut spending on capital and reduce employment throughout DATE. Despite the reduction in business investment, significant improvements in efficiency allowed firms to meet their sales and production goals without having to add workers. These improvements seem to have been the result both of organizational changes in business operations and of innovations in the use of existing technologies, perhaps the result of firms applying more effectively the new technologies they had acquired at a rapid pace in DATE. In DATE, the recovery took hold: The pace of consumer expenditures stepped up, and housing activity boomed. These developments were supported by a pickup in personal income growth as job losses abated and TIME compensation moved up, as well as by rising stock market and housing wealth. In addition, the caution and uncertainty that had weighed on businesses began to dissipate, and investment turned up in DATE. A marked increase in capital spending in DATE was spurred by significantly improving profits, low interest rates, and investment tax incentives. Nonetheless, the recovery remained \"jobless\" until the fall, when growth in private employment began to resume. Output in DATE continued to expand at the robust pace of DATE, and employment gains picked up sharply. However, economic activity hit a soft patch in DATE: The growth of real gross domestic product slowed to an DATE rate of NUM-NUM/NUM percent in DATE after posting a NUM-NUM/NUM percent average pace in DATE and over the four quarters of DATE. The DATE slowing was particularly evident in consumption, which was nearly unchanged on average DATE. Furthermore, job gains in the private sector, which had averaged close to NUM,NUM per month between DATE and DATE, slowed to about NUM,NUM per month on average during DATE. Economic developments DATE have undoubtedly been influenced by the steep run-up in oil prices from about $NUM per barrel for West Texas intermediate crude oil in December DATE to a record level of $NUM per barrel DATE. This rise in energy prices clearly has had a negative effect on the real purchasing power of households and has raised business costs. Nevertheless, the United States is probably less vulnerable to DATE's oil price shock than it was to the shocks of DATE and DATE, both because energy represents a smaller share of household purchases and business input costs than in those earlier periods and because the higher oil prices reflect, in part, stronger growth in the rest of the world, which in turn provides an offset in the form of higher demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, the most recent data suggest that the U.S. economy has regained some vigor in the second half of DATE. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP expanded at an DATE rate of NUM percent in DATE, and final sales grew at the fastest pace in a DATE. In particular, real consumer spending rebounded, as households responded to the aggressive incentives offered by motor vehicle companies by sharply increasing their purchases of new cars and trucks. In addition, low mortgage rates have helped sustain a high level of demand for new homes, and business investment in equipment and software posted another robust gain, led by a sharp increase in spending on non-high-tech equipment. Available indicators for DATE seem a little more mixed, but the general consensus of economic forecasters is that real GDP will expand in DATE at a pace similar to that in DATE. Although real incomes continue to be squeezed by significantly higher energy prices, recent spending indicators, including DATE retail sales report, suggest that consumption was well maintained in DATE. In addition, housing construction and home sales have been maintained at a robust pace in DATE, and recent declines in mortgage rates should continue to support demand. Business demand for high-tech equipment seems to have softened a little in DATE, judging both from the data on new orders and from industry commentary. However, business investment on non-high-tech equipment should be buoyed by strong fundamentals, including low interest rates and strong corporate balance sheets, as well as by the partial-expensing provisions of the current tax code, which encourage businesses to accelerate investment spending on longer-lived equipment to take advantage of the temporary tax incentive before it expires at the end of the DATE. Presumably reflecting these factors, bookings for non-high-tech capital goods have been on a steep uptrend in DATE. The latest reading on the labor market, which has been a source of uncertainty for some time, was particularly encouraging. After slowing DATE, employment on private nonfarm payrolls rose nearly NUM,NUM in DATE, about the same as the robust pace reported during DATE of DATE. DATE's increase was boosted somewhat by a sizable increase in construction employment, which was partly related to rebuilding and cleanup activity following DATE's hurricanes. But even so, the pace of hiring picked up for a wide range of other industries as well. That said, recent surveys and the continued, low level of labor force participation suggest that households remain concerned about a lack of employment opportunities, and we will have to wait and see whether this faster pace of hiring can be sustained. As you know, Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, and hence trade provides an important link between our economies. Indeed, U.S. exports to Canada are rising briskly so far DATE, albeit still not quite as fast as the rise in U.S. imports from Canada. More generally, a surge in Canadian exports has helped fuel the recovery in Canada DATE despite an appreciation of the Canadian dollar. However, unlike the United States, Canada is a net exporter of oil and other commodities and thus has also benefited, on balance, from the sustained rise in oil and other commodity prices DATE. Recent Canadian data are consistent with robust domestic demand growth in DATE, and employment gains have recently been strong. Over time, future improvements along these lines may also support higher demand for imports, which will in part come from the United States. Turning to the outlook for U.S. inflation, the rise in crude oil prices - coupled with rising margins for gasoline and higher prices for natural gas - contributed to a NUM percent DATE rate of increase in consumer energy prices over the first half of the DATE. And, although energy prices turned down briefly during DATE as gasoline margins returned to more normal levels, the latest indicators are pointing to significant increases in energy prices again DATE. As a result, headline consumer price inflation - as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - rose at an DATE rate of around NUM-NUM/NUM percent over the first three quarters of DATE, up from NUM-NUM/NUM percent in each of the past three DATEs. Despite the rise in oil prices, core consumer prices have risen at a moderate pace in DATE after picking up early DATE from last DATE's very low rate. On average, core PCE prices have increased at a NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE rate over the first three quarters of DATE, up only slightly from a NUM-NUM/NUM percent increase over the four quarters of DATE. As with the real economy, the absence of a more significant effect from oil prices on core inflation reflects, in part, the smaller share of energy in firms' production processes. But in addition, the Federal Reserve's commitment to low inflation seems to have limited the pass-through of higher energy prices to wages and inflation expectations. Indeed, despite some rapid increases in benefit costs - most notably for health insurance and defined benefit pension plans - overall TIME compensation has been rising at roughly a NUM percent DATE rate DATE, similar to last DATE's pace. Similarly, surveys of inflation expectations and implied inflation compensation from Treasury indexed security yields suggest that longer-term inflation expectations have been well anchored over this period, and short-term inflation expectations have actually eased on balance since midDATE despite the rise in energy prices. Looking ahead, economic fundamentals are consistent with the U.S. economy posting solid growth over the next DATE. Indeed, most forecasters expect that output will continue to rise next DATE at a pace similar to DATE's. For example, the most recent Blue Chip forecast sees output rising at a NUM-NUM/NUM percent rate in DATE, just a touch slower than their forecast for growth over the four quarters of DATE. With regard to inflation, the Blue Chip participants see the rise in the consumer price index slowing from NUM percent DATE to NUM percent over the four quarters of DATE. There are a number of reasons for this reasonably favorable outlook. First, monetary policy remains accommodative, even with the rise of NUM basis points in the federal funds rate since DATE. The nominal federal funds rate is currently NUM percent, a level that, using standard measures of core consumer price inflation, implies a real funds rate that is just above zero - considerably lower than the long-run average of about NUM-NUM/NUM percent. Of course, this long-run average may differ from the level of the real federal funds rate that is currently consistent with moving economic activity into line with its potential and keeping inflation low and stable. But even taking into account possible factors that would tend to push down the equilibrium rate - for example, business pessimism, energy prices, and our net export position - the real funds rate still seems low. Second, financial conditions in general look to be supportive of continued solid economic expansion. In addition to benchmark real interest rates being low, risk spreads are quite narrow, and lenders appear very willing to provide credit to businesses and households. Moreover, many businesses, through their actions to repair their balance sheets in recent DATEs, have built up large holdings of cash that can be tapped to finance investment outlays, and the substitution of long-term debt for short-term debt has reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates. Third, robust growth in underlying productivity should continue to support income growth and economic activity. I suspect that productivity will eventually slow from the extraordinary pace of the past few DATEs - indeed, the recent figures offer some evidence that some of the slowing has already occurred. Nonetheless, I am optimistic that part of the step-up in productivity will be sustained and that it will be reinforced by a robust pace of capital spending. Continued solid gains in productivity will be an important plus for our economy over the longer run because faster increases in productivity lead over time to higher profits, wages, and living standards. On the inflation front, the best news is that inflation is expected to be relatively low. With inflation expectations well anchored, the existing amount of slack and underlying strength in productivity should be offsetting pressures from indirect energy effects and other commodity price increases, which themselves should diminish as oil prices stabilize and then begin to decline. Nevertheless, and as always seems to be the case, there are considerable uncertainties surrounding the outlook for real activity and inflation. An obvious source of risk for the U.S. expansion continues to be the behavior of energy prices. As I noted, the steep run-up in crude oil prices DATE has significantly restrained real activity and pushed up overall inflation. And, the outlook for oil prices remains uncertain. Higher oil prices have damped the consumption of oil in the United States, but growing concerns about long-term supply, along with large prospective increases in demand from the rapidly growing economies of China, India, and other emerging-market economies have fueled an increase in futures prices of oil. In DATE, spot prices have eased back from mid-DATE's record levels, and market participants in oil futures markets seem to expect spot prices to ease somewhat further over the next two DATEs. But both the global demand for oil and the availability of new supplies are notoriously difficult to predict. Another uncertainty revolves around the effect of current tax policy on economic activity. Fiscal policy, which has been stimulative DATE, is expected to shift to a fairly neutral stance in DATE, following the removal of the partial-expensing provision for various capital goods at the end of DATE. Because the partial-expensing provision allows firms to subtract a large share of the cost of new capital equipment from profits right away, rather than depreciating the cost over time, it provides an incentive to firms to invest in new capital goods. However, estimates of the quantitative effect of this tax incentive on investment are highly uncertain. And anecdotal evidence that firms are responding to the partial-expensing provision is not clear-cut. As a result, the impact of its removal is equally unclear. Specifically, if partial expensing is having a very limited effect on firms' investment decisions, recent increases in business spending on equipment would be consistent with a stronger underlying pace of investment and faster GDP growth next DATE. Finally, the sustainability of expansion will depend importantly on the pace of improvement in the labor market. To be sure, DATE's payroll employment report was a positive sign. But as we saw earlier DATE, DATE of data does not make a trend. Robust job gains in DATE would be a convincing sign that businesses have become more confident about the future course of the expansion and would provide households with the wherewithal to maintain a healthy pace of spending growth. Let me turn finally to a brief discussion of monetary policy. As I noted earlier, monetary policy has played an important role in providing support for the economy in recent DATEs. But our work is not done. Now that the expansion seems to have taken hold, we face the challenge of making the transition to a policy stance more appropriate for sustained economic expansion. Our goal is to do so in a way that maximizes economic growth while sustaining the progress that we have made in achieving price stability. Keeping inflation low and stable will contribute importantly to sustaining financial conditions conducive for further gains in economic activity. Along these lines, the FOMC has raised the target federal funds rate by NUM basis points at each of our last four meetings. As indicated in its most recent statement, the FOMC continues to support the assessment that removal of accommodation will likely proceed at a measured pace. However, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability, and it is those developments that will ultimately determine the level and term structure of interest rates.",

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Factors influencing business investment Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Greater Issues Series, The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak DATE as part of the Citadel's Greater Issues Series. I will speak about one of the forces likely to shape developments in the U.S. economy. In past speeches, I have addressed the so-called jobless recovery, trade, global imbalances, and national saving. DATE, I round out this series on fundamental issues by reviewing business capital investment - that is, spending by businesses on such things as machines, computers, and new buildings. Although it makes up only about NUM percent of gross domestic product, business investment is a vital element of the U.S. economy, with important implications for a variety of broader economic issues. Investment has a large influence on DATE-to-year fluctuations in economic activity. During the past six recessions, the drop in domestic investment has generally accounted for most of the decline in GDP. Business investment was a major factor in both DATE economic expansion and the subsequent recession. In fact, the decline in business outlays on investment goods in DATE was even larger than the downturn in the overall economy. Although overall GDP edged down at an average DATE rate of only NUM percent in the first three quarters of DATE, the decline in business investment subtracted nearly NUM percentage points from GDP growth over that period. Clearly, some insight into investment swings would enable us to better understand the economic cycles of recessions and expansions, which in turn have such a big effect on job creation, the budget deficit, and a host of other important issues. Business investment also affects the broader economy through labor productivity - or output per hour of work. Over DATE, the average TIME output of American workers has increased nearly NUM percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than one-third of this improved efficiency likely reflects increases in the use of capital goods. Over DATE, efficiency gains due to increased capital expenditures have been especially pronounced. Because rising productivity is the primary means through which standards of living increase, capital investment is clearly an important part of the economic engine. Accordingly, an understanding of investment is critical for insight into both cyclical and longer-run economic developments. In my discussion DATE, I want to address the outlook for the three categories of business investment: equipment and software, structures, and inventories. Forecasting business investment is complicated, however. Despite the importance of this subject, the policymakers, academics, and business economists who study it have limited knowledge regarding its behavior and the factors determining that behavior. By highlighting some of the thorny issues that need to be considered, I hope to provide a backdrop to help elucidate the likely performance of business investment in the quarters to come. Although forecasting involves considerable uncertainty, I think that the prospects for business investment over DATE are, on balance, relatively positive. I should note, of course, that the comments that I make DATE reflect only my own views; they should not be taken to represent the views of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System. Equipment and software The largest component of business investment is expenditures on new equipment and software. This category includes computers, routers and switches, machinery, aircraft, trucks, software, and a wide variety of other types of equipment that are used to produce goods and services. Decisions of business people regarding equipment and software investment are based on their assessment of business prospects, the nature of the capital goods themselves, and financing conditions. In short, potential purchasers of business equipment will need to assess a plethora of variables that are at best known only imperfectly. For economists who forecast investment, the task is even harder: Not only must we form opinions about all these variables, we must try to discern the business community's response to them. Currently, demand for business products and services appears to be rising. In addition, interest rates remain low, and the business sector has ample cash on hand. Historically, such conditions have been associated with increasing real business spending on equipment and software. At the moment, however, at least four additional factors are clouding our view. First, after the trough of the last recession, businesses seemed more hesitant than usual to expand their productive capabilities. Concerns about terrorism, war, and corporate governance scandals may have made it harder for firms to have confidence that a robust and durable recovery was under way. With heightened uncertainty, many firms may have been reluctant to increase capital spending. The issue we face now, DATE since the trough, is whether this reluctance has abated. The evidence we have for ongoing business hesitancy is suggestive but far from conclusive. One piece of evidence is found in the state of the \"financing gap\" - the difference between a firm's capital expenditures and its cash flow, or internal funds. In the past, the financing gap for nonfinancial corporations was almost always positive - that is, capital spending was larger than internal funds. DATE, the financing gap rose from less than $NUM billion to a peak of more than $NUM billion. The rapid rise largely reflected sharp increases in capital expenditures in the telecommunications, high-tech, and transportation industries that greatly outstripped the increases in internally-generated funds. However, the financing gap fell abruptly in DATE and DATE, turned negative DATE, and has stayed below zero since then. This negative financing gap, which is widespread across industries, indicates that the business sector as a whole is generating enough cash to purchase capital expenditures without borrowing. In fact, because it has been negative for a while, the gap has contributed to the accumulation of a large cushion of liquid assets. Over DATE and DATE, liquid assets in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose $NUM billion, or more than NUM percent, to $NUM trillion. This news is good because it means that business balance sheets are in good shape and financial conditions are not holding back business investment. But the news is also troubling. Given the current low interest rates, the preference for holding financial assets over expanding operations suggests that businesses lack confidence in the future profitability of their potential ventures. The negative financing gap could very well be a sign that businesses remain cautious about the outlook - a condition that, unfortunately, can become a self-fulfilling prophesy. A second factor that complicates the outlook for investment is the state of the computer sector. About NUM percent of business spending on equipment and software is for computer gear. Some of that spending is to equip new plants and new employees, but a large share of it is to replace old machines and outdated technology. Over DATE, we have seen technology advance rapidly, and businesses have purchased a large amount of high-tech equipment. More recently, the growth rate of business spending on computers has slowed - from about NUM percent DATE to less than half that pace, on average, in DATE. One possible explanation is that we are seeing a deceleration in the pace of technical advancement. Technological progress affects business investment in primarily two ways. First, it changes how businesses organize their operations. Second, even innovations that do not spur an entirely new way of doing business can encourage equipment spending because some firms will choose to retire obsolete equipment more rapidly than they otherwise would. Accordingly, if the pace of progress slows, increases in business investment, particularly of high-tech goods, may also slow. Of course, we cannot directly measure the pace of technological progress, but we can look at some indicators to help us judge. One indicator that economists often look at is prices, particularly \"qualityadjusted prices\" compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to deflate nominal computer expenditures. Over time, these quality-adjusted prices tend to fall, as computers and related equipment become more and more powerful. Between NUM and DATE, the quality-adjusted price of new computers fell at an DATE rate of NUM percent. The speed at which these prices fall reflects mainly the pace of technological progress. Unfortunately, over DATE, the rate of price decline slowed from that experienced during DATE: Computer equipment prices fell just NUM percent at an DATE rate in DATE and DATE. Although we cannot be certain, at least some of this deceleration may represent some slowing in the rapid pace of technological improvement. Indeed, detailed data that we use in putting together the industrial production data suggest that the number of new PC models introduced DATE has fallen markedly from the pace posted in DATE, suggesting that the pace of innovation, at least in this one market, has slowed. A third factor for economists considering the outlook for the business sector is the question of whether the existing stock of business equipment is too high. As the high-tech boom of DATE was ending, many observers claimed that companies had been overly optimistic and had purchased too many PCs and peripherals and laid too much fiber optic cable, resulting in an actual capital stock that exceeded the desired level for business. When such a \"capital overhang\" emerges, new investment spending tends to be curtailed for a while. Indeed, in DATE and DATE, real outlays for equipment and software fell at an DATE rate of nearly NUM percent. Determining whether a capital overhang exists is difficult, and estimates of the size of overhangs are subject to considerable error. First, capital stocks are hard to measure; although we know the amount of new capital goods purchased, we can only roughly estimate the rate of economic depreciation and obsolescence. Consequently, we cannot know with certainty the level of the existing capital that is still available to be used. Second, we do not know how much capital firms would ideally like to employ because their expectations and production processes are always changing. Of course, we can estimate both actual and desired capital stocks, but these estimates are quite dependent on our assumptions, especially our assumptions about technological change. Based on the depreciation rates used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, we estimate that the growth rate of the capital stock of equipment and software slowed from around NUM percent in DATE and DATE to about NUM-NUM/NUM percent in DATE, a slowdown large enough to substantially shrink most estimates of the capital overhang. The final factor that complicates the outlook for equipment and software spending stems from the tax code. Currently, the partial-expensing provision in the tax law allows a firm to subtract a large fraction of the cost of new capital equipment from profits right away, rather than depreciating the cost over time, and thereby to lower its taxes. The partial-expensing provision, which provides an incentive to invest in new capital goods, will expire at the end of DATE. The impending expiration is probably boosting investment spending in the second half of DATE as firms rush to take the tax advantage before it disappears; however, at this point the evidence is not conclusive. The anecdotal evidence on whether firms are responding to the partial-expensing provision is sparse and somewhat contradictory. According to a summary of commentary on current economic conditions prepared by the San Francisco Fed in DATE, a number of contacted firms planned increases in capital spending, yet there was no mention of partial expensing. In contrast, a recent special question in the Philadelphia Fed's Business Outlook Survey showed that about one-quarter of respondents thought that the tax provision was likely to boost their spending DATE. The statistical evidence for a tax response is also inconclusive. Shipments of long-lived equipment (which should be more favorably affected than demand for short-lived equipment) have increased more than overall capital spending since the passage of the most recent version of the partial-expensing law - the pattern we would expect to see if businesses were taking advantage of the tax incentive. However, other explanations for this pattern are possible, and the difference between the long-lived and the short-lived categories is neither statistically significant nor terribly robust. The evidence that partial expensing is having an effect is not clear-cut, but my view is that capital spending is probably being influenced by the tax law and that its expiration in DATE will probably damp outlays in the early part of DATE. Nonresidential structures Besides spending on equipment and software, businesses also build and purchase nonresidential structures. Although this category - which includes factories, warehouses, shopping malls, oil wells, cell phone towers, fiber optic cable tunnels, office parks, and more - is only about NUM percent as large as the equipment and software category, it too can contribute to swings in GDP. In DATE and DATE, expenditures for new business structures declined more than $NUM billion, subtracting nearly NUM⁄NUM percentage point from DATE GDP growth on average in DATE. After having flattened out DATE, spending in this sector appears to have turned up recently. Business outlays on structures rose NUM percent in DATE, and construction data indicate that the sector expanded further in DATE DATE. Still, nonresidential structures are notoriously difficult to project with any certainty. Many sectors of the economy wax and wane along with the overall business cycle, but the structures sector tends to follow long cycles of its own. Although a weak economy is generally detrimental to spending in this category, expenditures often continue to increase well into an economic downturn, making forecasting difficult. In addition, the nonresidential structures category includes a diverse set of buildings, and forecasting this sector requires keeping tabs on a wide variety of indicators. Purchases of one of the largest components, commercial buildings, tend to be associated with conditions in the retail sector. Retail rents rose NUM percent in DATE that ended in DATE, the fastest pace in DATE, and the vacancy rate remains below NUM percent. Likewise, indicators for spending on drilling and mining wells, which usually rise after a jump in oil and natural gas prices, look quite strong. However, the outlook for outlays on office buildings, which tend to be correlated with activity and hiring in the business services sectors as well as in the finance and insurance industries, is less upbeat: Office rents have continued to fall, and the vacancy rate, at NUM percent, remains elevated. The vacancy rate for industrial buildings, a sector that generally keeps pace with manufacturing activity, has flattened out around NUM percent over DATE after having risen markedly for DATE. Thus, at the moment, the various indicators are giving fairly mixed signals. However, the mixed signals are still an improvement over the almost uniformly negative tone of the markets for nonresidential structures DATE. To me, they suggest that the nascent upturn in this sector is likely to continue. Inventory investment So far I have discussed business fixed investment. Another important part of capital expenditures, however, is inventory investment. There are three types of inventory investment: materials and supplies, work in progress, and finished goods. In dollar terms, inventory investment is not large: From NUM to DATE, it averaged about $NUM billion - less than NUM percent of GDP. However, because it can swing from a sizable positive as firms stockpile goods in DATE to a pronounced negative when they clear out the warehouses in DATE, the change in business inventories is generally considered to be one of the most important categories for understanding business-cycle volatility. The reasons that firms need to hold inventory stocks, unlike their reasons for investing in capital equipment and buildings, are not always obvious. For manufacturers, more than half of all inventories are held in the form of materials and supplies or as work in progress. These inventories are necessary, of course, to facilitate production. However, even inventories of finished goods are important. Businesses need to weigh the cost of running out of an item - perhaps forcing a customer to turn to a competitor - against the storage costs of carrying inventories from DATE. And, particularly in the retail sector, inventories of some goods - like clothing and cars - can spur sales because customers have the chance to try out different sizes or option packages before buying. With so many reasons for holding inventories, inventory investment may appear about as difficult to predict as investment in equipment or structures. It is probably even more difficult. So far I have mentioned only the reasons for which businesses intentionally change their inventory holdings. But inventory swings are often the result of miscalculations on the part of business owners. If a particular product is unexpectedly popular, inventories get drawn down; if the product is unpopular, inventories pile up. The situation is complicated for economists who are trying to draw inferences from flows into and out of inventories. We need not only to figure out how much inventory businesses have wanted to hold but also to discern when they have been surprised by sales. The difficulty of this task can be illustrated by the most recent period. In DATE of DATE, businesses accumulated inventory stocks at a rapid pace, after having kept inventories relatively lean for DATE. This acceleration in the pace of accumulation could mean that inventories had finally gotten too lean and that firms wanted to re-stock, or it could mean only that businesses were startled by the unexpectedly weak pace of demand for their products and that inventories piled up unintentionally. Answering this question is important for determining what is likely to happen to inventory building for the rest of DATE. How do we begin to gauge whether businesses wanted to rebuild inventories in DATE? One way is to look at the ratio of inventories to sales. In the nonfarm sector, this ratio has fallen nearly NUM percent in DATE, from DATE supply to DATE supply. Most likely this secular decline represents improvements in inventory management, possibly related to better technology. In DATE, the inventory-sales ratio fell especially sharply, dropping from NUM to NUM, or about NUM percent. Part of the decline likely reflected improvements in inventory-management techniques. However, unless the pace of technological change has improved markedly, the drop in the inventory-sales ratio probably also reflected sales outstripping the cautious expectations of businesses. The implication is that inventories may have been a bit on the lean side in the first part of DATE. If so, then some of the inventory accumulation in DATE may have been an intentional re-stocking of inventories that had become too lean. Survey results from the Institute of Supply Management support this conjecture. For DATE, a majority of respondents had said that their customers' inventories were too low. The most recent data, however, suggest that many supply managers have reassessed that view, and the mix of those who think customers' inventories are lean has moved more in line with those who think stocks are excessive. Thus, the recent upturn in inventory investment does not seem to be pointing toward another problematic inventory cycle, with its accompanying need to drastically reduce production to eliminate unwanted stocks. At the same time, the bulk of stock rebuilding appears to be behind us so that inventories are unlikely to be a major spur to GDP growth in the near future. Conclusions DATE, I have highlighted some of the issues that continue to challenge economists in evaluating the outlook for business investment, an extremely important element in determining the outlook for the economy more broadly. With respect to investment in equipment and software, although we do not know with certainty just how rapidly technology is changing and how much businesses are expecting to sell and produce in the future, a number of indicators can help explain recent trends and likely developments. At this point, although there is uncertainty, these indicators on balance suggest that the outlook in this sector is relatively positive. Regarding nonresidential structures, the mixed indicators are a distinct improvement over the negative outlook of DATE. And, regarding business inventories, the recent upturn in inventory investment does not appear to be problematic, but it seems unlikely that further inventory investment will impart significant forward momentum to the economy. In short, although the economy may not experience the outsized growth rates of high-tech equipment spending or other business investment seen in DATE, the fundamental features of the current U.S. economy argue for solid increases in the capital expenditures needed to produce and facilitate sales. With steady contributions from business investment, GDP growth is likely to continue expanding at a good pace, leading to further job gains and increases in family incomes. And in the longer run, the expansion of the capital stock can be expected to continue improving the efficiency of the American worker and thus to lead to additional increases in the standard of living.",

                  "Edward M Gramlich: Budget and trade deficits - linked, both worrisome in the long run, but not twins Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics Luncheon, Los Angeles, DATE. Presented at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress, London, England, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak DATE. While I know that most of you would welcome any insights I might have about current U.S. monetary policy - whether the Open Market Committee will be raising or lowering interest rates at our next meeting - I prefer to focus instead on some issues that could become serious over the longer run. These issues involve the persistent budget and trade deficits facing the American economy, issues that could eventually involve significant economic adjustments around the world.NUM Large budget and trade deficits are not a new phenomenon. They also arose in the United States in DATE. At that time, the business press and many economists began referring to the situation as one of \"twin deficits.\" With the current re-emergence of both deficits, the phrase has come back into common usage - too common, in my view. To be sure, in theoretical models there is a scenario by which budget deficits can create trade deficits, and one by which trade deficits can create budget deficits. But there are also many scenarios by which either deficit can arise independently, or even by which budget and trade deficits can move in opposite directions, as they did in DATE. In general, while budget and trade deficits can be linked, there are important differences between the two, both in how they respond to economic forces and in their long-run consequences. I start by examining the relationship between budget and trade deficits - why they are linked but not twins. I discuss the sustainability conditions for budget and trade deficits; the conditions that must be fulfilled for the debts on both accounts to be stabilized in relation to the size of the U.S. economy. Then I discuss what happens if either debt violates this condition and rises in relation to the size of the economy. This discussion, in turn, raises further interesting distinctions between the two deficits. The link The link between budget and trade deficits can be seen most naturally through the national income accounting framework. Any saving the nation does finances either private domestic investment directly or the accumulation of claims on foreigners. This means that national saving - the sum of private and government saving - equals private domestic investment plus that period's accumulation of claims on foreigners, or the trade surplus. The trade surplus can also be thought of as net foreign lending. All of these relationships are accounting identities - true at every moment in time apart from data inconsistencies captured by a statistical discrepancy. In equation form, we have (NUM) NS = S - BD = I - TD On the left side of the equation NS refers to national saving, S refers to overall private saving, and BD refers to the government budget deficit. This part of the equation says merely that total national saving equals the sum of all saving done in the economy by the private sector and the government sector. A budget surplus would be treated as governmental saving and added to private saving; a budget deficit would be treated as governmental dissaving and subtracted. The right side of the equation repeats the familiar open economy identity that national saving equals private domestic investment, I, plus the accumulation of claims on foreigners or less that domestic investment financed by foreigners. As was noted earlier, borrowing from foreigners involves either a reduction of claims on them or an increase of claims on us by them. It is by definition equal to the trade deficit TD. In the equation, then, a trade surplus means that some national saving goes to building up claims on foreigners (national saving is greater than domestic investment) while a trade deficit means that some investment is financed by foreigners (national saving is less than domestic investment). This identity first demonstrates the all-important role of national saving in shaping long-run economic welfare. National saving is the only way a country can have its capital and own it too. Models of the economic growth process identify national saving as one of the key policy variables in influencing a nation's living standards in the long run. The identity also makes clear that the budget deficit and the trade deficit can move together on a dollar-per-dollar basis, but only if the difference between private domestic investment and private saving is constant. Typically that difference will not be constant. For example, if there were to be an investment boom, interest rates might rise to induce some new private saving and some new lending by foreigners. The implied trade deficit might rise and, because of the rise in income, the budget deficit might fall. In this case, the trade deficit would increase while the budget deficit fell. Conversely, suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits. If this expansion were totally financed by borrowing from foreigners, domestic interest rates would not change much, and domestic investment and private saving might not either. In this scenario, there could be a simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change in budget and trade deficits - the classic twin-deficit scenario. Such a situation is most likely to occur in small economies fully open to international trade and capital flows, economies in which domestic interest rates are determined by world capital markets and are independent of domestic economic variables. But if domestic interest rates do change, as they likely would in either a closed economy or a large open economy, private investment and saving would also likely change, and any strict link between budget and trade deficits would be broken. One could spin any number of scenarios, but these are enough to make the basic point. Because of the underlying relationship between saving and investment, budget and trade deficits could be strictly linked. But in a large open economy like the United States, it is easy to imagine plenty of scenarios in which they are imperfectly linked, and even some scenarios in which they move in opposite directions. Budget and trade deficits should be viewed as linked, but not as twins. Stability conditions Although the economic implications and reactions of budget deficits and trade deficits differ, both are deficits. Another elementary accounting identity says that last period's debt level plus the current deficit equals the current period's debt level. This identity is true whether we are talking about budget deficits building up the stock of outstanding government debt (a liability of the government sector to the private sector), or trade deficits building up the stock of external debt (the net stock of accumulated foreign claims against the United States).NUM Economists have worried for DATE about optimal stocks of government and external debt. For government debt, the optimal stock turns out to be related to the optimal level of national saving, which can be defined as the level that maximizes the nation's long-term path of consumption per worker. The optimal stock of net external debt can be determined in the same framework from an open economy perspective. While these models can be instructive, DATE I am going to focus on a weaker standard. Whatever the long-term optimal level of government debt, and whatever the optimal level of external debt, one can separately ask whether either debt level is becoming a more, or less, important economic factor over time. For government debt, this weaker standard, or stability condition, determines merely whether the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is stable. If it is, interest payments on the debt will, in equilibrium, also settle down to a stable proportion of GDP. For external debt, a stable debt-to-GDP ratio means that the net interest and dividend payments of the United States to foreign investors will also settle down to a constant ratio to GDP. The appendix derives this stability condition generically. It is that d (NUM) (g - i)/(DATE g) = p, where d is the stable ratio of debt to GDP, g is the nominal growth rate of the economy, i is the nominal interest rate in the economy, and p is the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP. For budget accounts, the primary deficit is the national income accounts budget deficit, but excluding interest payments. For trade accounts, the primary trade deficit is the current account deficit, excluding net interest and dividend payments to foreigners.NUM As a general rule, the economy's growth rate and interest rate will be fairly close. The equation says that if they are equal, the primary deficit must be zero to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. If the interest rate is slightly above the growth rate, as it would be in models without risk for economies that save less than the theoretical optimum, a nation with outstanding debt would have to run a slight primary surplus to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio. If the effective interest rate on debt is slightly below the growth rate, as it has generally been found to be in the past for both deficits, a nation with outstanding debt could run slight primary deficits and not see the debt ratio grow.NUM On the foreign side, this condition has until now been especially forgiving. Even with a large net debt position, our net investment income from foreigners has exceeded that paid out to foreigners. Since the net interest rate has been less than the GDP growth rate, the ratio of external debt to GDP could have been stabilized with a moderate primary trade deficit.NUM Magnitudes It is well known that the U.S. economy now suffers both budget and trade deficits. But how do these deficits compare with the stability conditions? Historically, there have not been significant instabilities in U.S. federal budget deficits.NUM Overall deficits have averaged about NUM percent of GDP over DATE, but figure NUM shows that when interest is deducted, primary budget deficits have averaged close to zero, the approximate level that stabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio. Hence, the outstanding debt, while fluctuating in the range of NUM percent to NUM percent of GDP, has actually declined slightly as a share of GDP. It was NUM percent of GDP in DATE and is now only NUM percent of GDP. The ratio did rise as high as NUM percent in the high-deficit DATE of DATE, but it dropped sharply thereafter with the primary budget surpluses of DATE. Looking ahead, things might not be so favorable. As a result of recent fiscal changes, the budget has lately fallen into primary deficit again; this primary deficit is now more than NUM percent of GDP (NUM percent after cyclical adjustment). The deterioration reflects the much-discussed recent rapid growth in expenditures, along with significant tax cuts. Perhaps more significant, in a few DATE the United States will face huge looming costs for retirement and health programs. It will take extraordinary fiscal discipline just to keep the present primary deficit near its current level of NUM to NUM percent of GDP over the short, medium, and long run. And even at that level, the stability condition is violated by at least NUM percent of GDP, suggesting that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to climb steadily upward.NUM NUM This primary trade deficit differs from the trade deficit component of GDP mentioned earlier because it includes foreign transfers and other small items. NUM Laurence Ball, Douglas W. Elmendorf, and N. Gregory Mankiw, \"The Deficit Gamble,\" Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, vol. NUM, no. NUM, (DATE), pp. NUM-NUM, show that interest rates on domestic government debt have generally been slightly less than the GDP growth rate in DATE. NUM The rate-of-return puzzle is in turn a question about why foreign direct investment in the United States has such a low rate of return. See Raymond J. Mataloni, Jr., \"An Examination of the Low Rates of Return of Foreign-Owned U.S. Companies,\" Survey of Current Business, vol. DATE (DATE), pp. DATE. NUM Even though the previous identity referred to the consumption budget for the entire government sector, in this section I switch over to the familiar concept of the total budget for the U.S. federal government. State and local governments more or less finance their current spending and do not have much outstanding debt apart from that backed by capital formation; and federal capital investment is very small. NUM These statements are based on estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook, DATE NUM (DATE). A further discussion of the long-run budget outlook can be found in Alan J. Auerbach, BIS Review NUM/NUM On the trade side, figure NUM shows that the trend is definitely more worrisome. While the budget debt has fluctuated between NUM percent and NUM percent of GDP over DATE, the net external debt has grown steadily. Until DATE, this external debt was not even positive; that is, until that time the United States had net claims on foreigners. But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since DATE, the net external debt is now NUM percent of GDP and rising sharply. The primary trade deficit is now NUM percent of GDP, violating the stability condition by nearly this same amount. At this rate, the external debt ratio will climb very quickly. While the trade deficit does have equilibrating tendencies, as will be discussed later, there are also forces that tend to increase it. Econometric studies of the basic demand for imports and exports find that the U.S. income elasticity of demand for imports is higher than the foreign income elasticity of demand for U.S. exports. This means that even if the world economy grows at the same rate as the U.S. economy, our trade deficit is likely to widen, (apart from any changes in relative prices).NUM Indeed, the U.S. primary trade deficit has widened steadily since DATE. Adjustments I have just argued that the U.S. is now in violation of the stability condition for both budget and trade deficits - recently and moderately on the budget side, persistently and significantly on the trade side. What are the implications? With each deficit there is probably a credibility range. By that, I mean a limited range within which a country may be able to violate its stability condition and have its debt-to-GDP ratio trend upward without further economic consequences. For budgets, there may be a range within which the debt-to-GDP ratio can grow without significant changes in interest rates.NUM As equation NUM indicates, economic performance in this range is by no means optimal, because the persistent deficits are subtracting funds that would otherwise be devoted to capital investment and future growth in living standards. But there may not be significant relative price effects. The same is true on the trade side; there could be a range in which foreign claims on the United States just build up without major impact on relative prices. Once the economy gets outside of the credibility range, more significant relative price adjustments become likely. On the trade side, for example, the continued accumulation of foreign claims on the U.S. economy will raise the issue of whether foreign investors will want to hold an ever-increasing share of their wealth in the form of U.S. assets. Or, as is the focus of the stability condition above, whether the U.S. economy can indefinitely pay out ever-higher shares of GDP in the form of interest and dividend payments. The conventional view is that at some point there should be a relative price adjustment - some combination of rising U.S. interest rates (to make U.S. assets more attractive), rising foreign prices (to make imports more expensive), moderating U.S. prices (to make U.S. exports more competitive), or a change in exchange rates. Each of these reactions is likely to occur naturally, and each moves in the direction of lowering the external imbalance. That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting. The main risk here is that the natural adjustments may not occur gradually, but so rapidly as to threaten various types of dislocations. There are complicating factors. One involves the currency denomination of the net debt. Countries with large trade deficits often have their external liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Hence, when their own currency depreciates, the value and burden of foreign debt automatically increases. The United States does not have this problem because most of its debt is denominated in dollars - say, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills. If the dollar were to fall, the value of our debt in terms of foreign currencies would then automatically decline, inducing foreign wealth-holders to make further portfolio shifts, perhaps even including increasing their stock of dollar-denominated debt. This denomination effect would not permanently prevent any relative price adjustment, but it could lengthen the process. Beyond that, for pragmatic reasons this conventional adjustment process could be extended or distorted even further. By way of illustration, Asian central banks have now accumulated more than a trillion dollars of international currency reserves - largely in dollar-denominated assets - equal to roughly half of the outstanding net debt of the United States. These central banks are not traditional wealth-holders motivated by expected risks and returns. Instead, they seem motivated more by the prospect of preserving low domestic currency values for their exporters.NUM To pursue this objective, they can print money to buy U.S. securities. This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities - and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible. But if these central banks continue behaving this way, the so-called credibility range could be extended significantly. While trade deficits should ultimately correct themselves, perhaps after a long trek through the credibility range, there are really no natural self-corrective mechanisms for budget deficits. Once the U.S. economy gets through the credibility range, interest rates on the increasing government debt will have to rise to induce people to hold the debt. This rise increases the interest burden and causes total deficits to rise further, all the time subtracting more and more funds from capital accumulation. Once this process begins, market psychology may hasten the adjustment.NUM Hence, while natural forces lessen the basic external imbalance, they increase the basic budget imbalance. In the long run, the only way to correct budget deficits is for policymakers to correct them. Outside forces There are several outside forces - both natural and as a result of policy - that could influence budget and trade deficits. One generally helpful influence is productivity growth. Say the U.S. economy benefits from an exogenous positive shock to productivity growth, as it seemed to have in DATE. This shock would raise the trend path of income, meaning that slightly higher primary budget and trade deficits could still be consistent with debt-to-GDP stability; in effect, a higher level of g can be plugged into equation NUM (at least as long as it is not offset by a higher i). Higher productivity could also help lengthen the credibility range, the range in which moderate changes in the debt ratio might not lead to adverse changes in relative prices. Among other things, higher productivity could raise the marginal product of capital and make investment in U.S. assets relatively attractive. But even with these favorable developments, the stability conditions discussed above still hold. If they are violated, the natural adjustment mechanisms will eventually take over for the trade deficit, and the primary budget deficit will eventually have to be reduced to stop a growing government debt ratio. One unhelpful measure is trade protectionism. While it might appear that trade protectionism would correct trade deficits, it probably will not. Over the medium and long run, the economy should be producing near its natural growth path, perhaps because of timely monetary and/or fiscal policy, perhaps because of natural equilibrating forces in the economy. In this event, trade protectionism would not stimulate added national production. Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the added spending demands for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production. Put another way, equation NUM shows that the trade deficit is ultimately determined by national saving and investment. Without a change in these, protectionism merely shifts the types of goods that are produced. It does not increase overall production and, short of cutting off trade altogether, does not even change the trade balance. Moreover, as is well known, over the long run, trade protection lowers a nation's standard of living. Finally, suppose politicians actually do correct budget deficits, again assuming an economy near its medium-term growth path. As mentioned above, such a fiscal austerity policy is the only known way to correct persistent budget deficits. The reduction in deficits should lower domestic interest rates and trigger changes in exchange rates that lower imports and raise exports. Hence, well-designed fiscal austerity measures could solve all the problems simultaneously. They correct budget deficits directly, they reduce trade deficits indirectly, and the implied higher level of national saving also permits more funds to flow into capital formation and long-term productivity enhancements. Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously. Conclusions There are obviously strong links between budget and trade deficits, and the deficit-debt dynamic relationships are very similar. At the same time, it is misleading simply to equate the two deficits, as is often done in the twin-deficit literature. Budget deficits typically involve a reduction in national saving and, if large, a steadily growing government debt-to-GDP ratio. They typically will not be corrected without explicit action. Trade deficits, on the other hand, typically involve an increase in foreign claims on the U.S. economy. As these claims grow in relation to national income, at least some natural forces are set in motion to correct the imbalance. From a policy standpoint, neither deficit may be terribly harmful in the short run, and at least the recent fiscal deficits have been useful in stabilizing movements in output. Moreover, there is likely to be a credibility range in which debt levels could rise relative to GDP without much change in relative prices. In the long run, however, both deficits could become much more worrisome. There are forces tending to increase both deficits: political and demographic for budget deficits, income elasticities for trade deficits. At some point, continued large-scale trade deficits could trigger equilibrating, and possibly dislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Continued budget deficits will steadily detract from the growth of the U.S. capital stock and may also trigger dislocating changes. Appendix: Derivation of the stability condition Let P denote the primary deficit (for either budget or trade), D the debt for either, and i the nation's nominal riskless interest rate. Then apart from valuation adjustments (A1) D = D-NUM (DATE) + P Divide through by GDP (Y): (A2) D/ Y = (D-NUM /Y-NUM ) (DATE)/(DATE g) + P/Y. Use lower case letters to refer to the ratio of a variable to GDP. This ratio is a measure of the proportionate importance of the variable. (A3) d = d (DATE)/(DATE g) + p. -NUM If there is stability in the debt-to-GDP ratio, d = d -NUM = d. Then (A4) d (NUM - (DATE)/(DATE g)) = p and (A5) d (g - i)/(DATE g) = p d This is equation NUM in the text. Note that if i = g, p must equal NUM. If is positive and i > g, p must be less than zero, a primary surplus. If d is positive and i < g, p can be greater than zero, a primary deficit.",

                  "Edward M Gramlich: Budget and trade deficits - linked, both worrisome in the long run, but not twins Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress, London, DATE.    Thank you for inviting me to speak DATE. While I know that most of you would welcome any insights I might have about current U.S. monetary policy - whether the Open Market Committee will be raising or lowering interest rates at our next meeting - I prefer to focus instead on some issues that could become serious over the longer run. These issues involve the persistent budget and trade deficits facing the American economy, issues that could eventually involve significant economic adjustments around the world.NUM Large budget and trade deficits are not a new phenomenon. They also arose in the United States in DATE. At that time, the business press and many economists began referring to the situation as one of \"twin deficits.\" With the current re-emergence of both deficits, the phrase has come back into common usage - too common, in my view. To be sure, in theoretical models there is a scenario by which budget deficits can create trade deficits, and one by which trade deficits can create budget deficits. But there are also many scenarios by which either deficit can arise independently, or even by which budget and trade deficits can move in opposite directions, as they did in DATE. In general, while budget and trade deficits can be linked, there are important differences between the two, both in how they respond to economic forces and in their long-run consequences. I start by examining the relationship between budget and trade deficits - why they are linked but not twins. I discuss the sustainability conditions for budget and trade deficits; the conditions that must be fulfilled for the debts on both accounts to be stabilized in relation to the size of the U.S. economy. Then I discuss what happens if either debt violates this condition and rises in relation to the size of the economy. This discussion, in turn, raises further interesting distinctions between the two deficits. The link The link between budget and trade deficits can be seen most naturally through the national income accounting framework. Any saving the nation does finances either private domestic investment directly or the accumulation of claims on foreigners. This means that national saving - the sum of private and government saving - equals private domestic investment plus that period's accumulation of claims on foreigners, or the trade surplus. The trade surplus can also be thought of as net foreign lending. All of these relationships are accounting identities - true at every moment in time apart from data inconsistencies captured by a statistical discrepancy. In equation form, we have NS = S - BD = I - TD (NUM) On the left side of the equation NS refers to national saving, S refers to overall private saving, and BD refers to the government budget deficit. This part of the equation says merely that total national saving equals the sum of all saving done in the economy by the private sector and the government sector. A budget surplus would be treated as governmental saving and added to private saving; a budget deficit would be treated as governmental dissaving and subtracted. The right side of the equation repeats the familiar open economy identity that national saving equals private domestic investment, I, plus the accumulation of claims on foreigners or less that domestic investment financed by foreigners. As was noted earlier, borrowing from foreigners involves either a reduction of claims on them or an increase of claims on us by them. It is by definition equal to the trade deficit TD. In the equation, then, a trade surplus means that some national saving goes to building up claims on foreigners (national saving is greater than domestic investment) while a trade deficit means that some investment is financed by foreigners (national saving is less than domestic investment). This identity first demonstrates the all-important role of national saving in shaping long-run economic welfare. National saving is the only way a country can have its capital and own it too. Models of the economic growth process identify national saving as one of the key policy variables in influencing a nation's living standards in the long run. The identity also makes clear that the budget deficit and the trade deficit can move together on a dollar-per-dollar basis, but only if the difference between private domestic investment and private saving is constant. Typically that difference will not be constant. For example, if there were to be an investment boom, interest rates might rise to induce some new private saving and some new lending by foreigners. The implied trade deficit might rise and, because of the rise in income, the budget deficit might fall. In this case, the trade deficit would increase while the budget deficit fell. Conversely, suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits. If this expansion were totally financed by borrowing from foreigners, domestic interest rates would not change much, and domestic investment and private saving might not either. In this scenario, there could be a simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change in budget and trade deficits - the classic twin-deficit scenario. Such a situation is most likely to occur in small economies fully open to international trade and capital flows, economies in which domestic interest rates are determined by world capital markets and are independent of domestic economic variables. But if domestic interest rates do change, as they likely would in either a closed economy or a large open economy, private investment and saving would also likely change, and any strict link between budget and trade deficits would be broken. One could spin any number of scenarios, but these are enough to make the basic point. Because of the underlying relationship between saving and investment, budget and trade deficits could be strictly linked. But in a large open economy like the United States, it is easy to imagine plenty of scenarios in which they are imperfectly linked, and even some scenarios in which they move in opposite directions. Budget and trade deficits should be viewed as linked, but not as twins. Stability conditions Although the economic implications and reactions of budget deficits and trade deficits differ, both are deficits. Another elementary accounting identity says that last period's debt level plus the current deficit equals the current period's debt level. This identity is true whether we are talking about budget deficits building up the stock of outstanding government debt (a liability of the government sector to the private sector), or trade deficits building up the stock of external debt (the net stock of accumulated foreign claims against the United States).NUM Economists have worried for DATE about optimal stocks of government and external debt. For government debt, the optimal stock turns out to be related to the optimal level of national saving, which can be defined as the level that maximizes the nation's long-term path of consumption per worker. The optimal stock of net external debt can be determined in the same framework from an open economy perspective. While these models can be instructive, DATE I am going to focus on a weaker standard. Whatever the long-term optimal level of government debt, and whatever the optimal level of external debt, one can separately ask whether either debt level is becoming a more, or less, important economic factor over time. For government debt, this weaker standard, or stability condition, determines merely whether the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is stable. If it is, interest payments on the debt will, in equilibrium, also settle down to a stable proportion of GDP. For external debt, a stable debt-to-GDP ratio means that the net interest and dividend payments of the United States to foreign investors will also settle down to a constant ratio to GDP. The appendix derives this stability condition generically. It is that d (g - i)/(DATE g) = p, (NUM) where d is the stable ratio of debt to GDP, g is the nominal growth rate of the economy, i is the nominal interest rate in the economy, and p is the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP. For budget accounts, the primary deficit is the national income accounts budget deficit, but excluding interest payments. For trade accounts, the primary trade deficit is the current account deficit, excluding net interest and dividend payments to foreigners.NUM As a general rule, the economy's growth rate and interest rate will be fairly close. The equation says that if they are equal, the primary deficit must be zero to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. If the interest rate is slightly above the growth rate, as it would be in models without risk for economies that save less than the theoretical optimum, a nation with outstanding debt would have to run a slight primary surplus to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio. If the effective interest rate on debt is slightly below the growth rate, as it has generally been found to be in the past for both deficits, a nation with outstanding debt could run slight primary deficits and not see the debt ratio grow.NUM On the foreign side, this condition has until now been especially forgiving. Even with a large net debt position, our net investment income from foreigners has exceeded that paid out to foreigners. Since the net interest rate has been less than the GDP growth rate, the ratio of external debt to GDP could have been stabilized with a moderate primary trade deficit.NUM Magnitudes It is well known that the U.S. economy now suffers both budget and trade deficits. But how do these deficits compare with the stability conditions? Historically, there have not been significant instabilities in U.S. federal budget deficits.NUM Overall deficits have averaged about NUM percent of GDP over DATE, but Figure NUM shows that when interest is deducted, primary budget deficits have averaged close to zero, the approximate level that stabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio. Hence, the outstanding debt, while fluctuating in the range of NUM percent to NUM percent of GDP, has actually declined slightly as a share of GDP. It was NUM percent of GDP in DATE and is now only NUM percent of GDP. The ratio did rise as high as NUM percent in the high-deficit DATE of DATE, but it dropped sharply thereafter with the primary budget surpluses of DATE. Looking ahead, things might not be so favorable. As a result of recent fiscal changes, the budget has lately fallen into primary deficit again; this primary deficit is now more than NUM percent of GDP (NUM percent after cyclical adjustment). The deterioration reflects the much-discussed recent rapid growth in expenditures, along with significant tax cuts. Perhaps more significant, in a few DATE the United States will face huge looming costs for retirement and health programs. It will take extraordinary fiscal discipline just to keep the present primary deficit near its current level of NUM to NUM percent of GDP over the short, medium, and long run. And even at that level, the stability condition is violated by at least NUM percent of GDP, suggesting that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to climb steadily upward.NUM NUM This primary trade deficit differs from the trade deficit component of GDP mentioned earlier because it includes foreign transfers and other small items. NUM Laurence Ball, Douglas W. Elmendorf, and N. Gregory Mankiw, \"The Deficit Gamble\", Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, vol. NUM, no. NUM, (DATE), pp. NUM-NUM, show that interest rates on domestic government debt have generally been slightly less than the GDP growth rate in DATE. NUM The rate-of-return puzzle is in turn a question about why foreign direct investment in the United States has such a low rate of return. See Raymond J. Mataloni, Jr., \"An Examination of the Low Rates of Return of Foreign-Owned U.S. Companies\", Survey of Current Business, vol. DATE (DATE), pp. DATE. NUM Even though the previous identity referred to the consumption budget for the entire government sector, in this section I switch over to the familiar concept of the total budget for the U.S. federal government. State and local governments more or less finance their current spending and do not have much outstanding debt apart from that backed by capital formation; and federal capital investment is very small. NUM These statements are based on estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook, DATE NUM (DATE). A further discussion of the long-run budget outlook can be found in Alan J. Auerbach, William G. Gale, Peter R. Orszag, and Samara R. Potter, \"Budget Blues: The Fiscal Outlook and Options for Reform,\" in Henry J. Aaron, James Lindsay, and Pietro Nivola (eds.), Agenda for the Nation (The Brookings Institution, DATE). See also the General Accounting Office, Truth and Transparency: The Federal Government's Financial Condition and Fiscal Outlook BIS Review NUM/NUM On the trade side, Figure NUM shows that the trend is definitely more worrisome. While the budget debt has fluctuated between NUM percent and NUM percent of GDP over DATE, the net external debt has grown steadily. Until DATE, this external debt was not even positive; that is, until that time the United States had net claims on foreigners. But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since DATE, the net external debt is now NUM percent of GDP and rising sharply. The primary trade deficit is now NUM percent of GDP, violating the stability condition by nearly this same amount. At this rate, the external debt ratio will climb very quickly. While the trade deficit does have equilibrating tendencies, as will be discussed later, there are also forces that tend to increase it. Econometric studies of the basic demand for imports and exports find that the U.S. income elasticity of demand for imports is higher than the foreign income elasticity of demand for U.S. exports. This means that even if the world economy grows at the same rate as the U.S. economy, our trade deficit is likely to widen, (apart from any changes in relative prices).NUM Indeed, the U.S. primary trade deficit has widened steadily since DATE. Adjustments I have just argued that the U.S. is now in violation of the stability condition for both budget and trade deficits - recently and moderately on the budget side, persistently and significantly on the trade side. What are the implications? With each deficit there is probably a credibility range. By that, I mean a limited range within which a country may be able to violate its stability condition and have its debt-to-GDP ratio trend upward without further economic consequences. For budgets, there may be a range within which the debtto-GDP ratio can grow without significant changes in interest rates.NUM As equation NUM indicates, economic performance in this range is by no means optimal, because the persistent deficits are subtracting funds that would otherwise be devoted to capital investment and future growth in living standards. But there may not be significant relative price effects. The same is true on the trade side; there could be a range in which foreign claims on the United States just build up without major impact on relative prices. Once the economy gets outside of the credibility range, more significant relative price adjustments become likely. On the trade side, for example, the continued accumulation of foreign claims on the U.S. economy will raise the issue of whether foreign investors will want to hold an ever-increasing share of their wealth in the form of U.S. assets. Or, as is the focus of the stability condition above, whether the U.S. economy can indefinitely pay out ever-higher shares of GDP in the form of interest and dividend payments. The conventional view is that at some point there should be a relative price adjustment - some combination of rising U.S. interest rates (to make U.S. assets more attractive), rising foreign prices (to make imports more expensive), moderating U.S. prices (to make U.S. exports more competitive), or a change in exchange rates. Each of these reactions is likely to occur naturally, and each moves in the direction of lowering the external imbalance. That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting. The main risk here is that the natural adjustments may not occur gradually, but so rapidly as to threaten various types of dislocations. There are complicating factors. One involves the currency denomination of the net debt. Countries with large trade deficits often have their external liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Hence, when their own currency depreciates, the value and burden of foreign debt automatically increases. The United States does not have this problem because most of its debt is denominated in dollars - say, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills. If the dollar were to fall, the value of our debt in terms of foreign currencies would then automatically decline, inducing foreign wealth-holders to make further portfolio shifts, perhaps even including increasing their stock of dollar-denominated debt. This denomination effect would not permanently prevent any relative price adjustment, but it could lengthen the process. Beyond that, for pragmatic reasons this conventional adjustment process could be extended or distorted even further. By way of illustration, Asian central banks have now accumulated more than a trillion dollars of international currency reserves - largely in dollar-denominated assets - equal to roughly half of the outstanding net debt of the United States. These central banks are not traditional wealth-holders motivated by expected risks and returns. Instead, they seem motivated more by the prospect of preserving low domestic currency values for their exporters.NUM To pursue this objective, they can print money to buy U.S. securities. This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities - and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible. But if these central banks continue behaving this way, the so-called credibility range could be extended significantly. While trade deficits should ultimately correct themselves, perhaps after a long trek through the credibility range, there are really no natural self-corrective mechanisms for budget deficits. Once the U.S. economy gets through the credibility range, interest rates on the increasing government debt will have to rise to induce people to hold the debt. This rise increases the interest burden and causes total deficits to rise further, all the time subtracting more and more funds from capital accumulation. Once this process begins, market psychology may hasten the adjustment.NUM Hence, while natural forces lessen the basic external imbalance, they increase the basic budget imbalance. In the long run, the only way to correct budget deficits is for policymakers to correct them. Outside forces There are several outside forces - both natural and as a result of policy - that could influence budget and trade deficits. One generally helpful influence is productivity growth. Say the U.S. economy benefits from an exogenous positive shock to productivity growth, as it seemed to have in DATE. This shock would raise the trend path of income, meaning that slightly higher primary budget and trade deficits could still be consistent with debt-to-GDP stability; in effect, a higher level of g can be plugged into equation NUM (at least as long as it is not offset by a higher i). Higher productivity could also help lengthen the credibility range, the range in which moderate changes in the debt ratio might not lead to adverse changes in relative prices. Among other things, higher productivity could raise the marginal product of capital and make investment in U.S. assets relatively attractive. But even with these favorable developments, the stability conditions discussed above still hold. If they are violated, the natural adjustment mechanisms will eventually take over for the trade deficit, and the primary budget deficit will eventually have to be reduced to stop a growing government debt ratio. One unhelpful measure is trade protectionism. While it might appear that trade protectionism would correct trade deficits, it probably will not. Over the medium and long run, the economy should be producing near its natural growth path, perhaps because of timely monetary and/or fiscal policy, perhaps because of natural equilibrating forces in the economy. In this event, trade protectionism would not stimulate added national production. Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the added spending demands for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production. Put another way, equation NUM shows that the trade deficit is ultimately determined by national saving and investment. Without a change in these, protectionism merely shifts the types of goods that are produced. It does not increase overall production and, short of cutting off trade altogether, does not even change the trade balance. Moreover, as is well known, over the long run, trade protection lowers a nation's standard of living. Finally, suppose politicians actually do correct budget deficits, again assuming an economy near its medium-term growth path. As mentioned above, such a fiscal austerity policy is the only known way to correct persistent budget deficits. The reduction in deficits should lower domestic interest rates and trigger changes in exchange rates that lower imports and raise exports. Hence, well-designed fiscal austerity measures could solve all the problems simultaneously. They correct budget deficits directly, they reduce trade deficits indirectly, and the implied higher level of national saving also permits more funds to flow into capital formation and long-term productivity enhancements. Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously. Conclusions There are obviously strong links between budget and trade deficits, and the deficit-debt dynamic relationships are very similar. At the same time, it is misleading simply to equate the two deficits, as is often done in the twin-deficit literature. Budget deficits typically involve a reduction in national saving and, if large, a steadily growing government debt-to-GDP ratio. They typically will not be corrected without explicit action. Trade deficits, on the other hand, typically involve an increase in foreign claims on the U.S. economy. As these claims grow in relation to national income, at least some natural forces are set in motion to correct the imbalance. From a policy standpoint, neither deficit may be terribly harmful in the short run, and at least the recent fiscal deficits have been useful in stabilizing movements in output. Moreover, there is likely to be a credibility range in which debt levels could rise relative to GDP without much change in relative prices. In the long run, however, both deficits could become much more worrisome. There are forces tending to increase both deficits: political and demographic for budget deficits, income elasticities for trade deficits. At some point, continued large-scale trade deficits could trigger equilibrating, and possibly dislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Continued budget deficits will steadily detract from the growth of the U.S. capital stock and may also trigger dislocating changes. Appendix: Derivation of the stability condition Let P denote the primary deficit (for either budget or trade), D the debt for either, and i the nation's nominal riskless interest rate. Then apart from valuation adjustments D = D-NUM (DATE) + P (A1) Divide through by GDP (Y): D/ Y = (D-NUM /Y-NUM ) (DATE)/(DATE g) + P/Y. (A2) Use lower case letters to refer to the ratio of a variable to GDP. This ratio is a measure of the proportionate importance of the variable. d = d (DATE)/(DATE g) + p. (A3) -NUM If there is stability in the debt-to-GDP ratio, d = d -NUM = d. Then d (NUM - (DATE)/(DATE g)) = p (A4) and d (g - i)/(DATE g) = p (A5) This is equation NUM in the text. Note that if i = g, p must equal NUM. If d is positive and i > g, p must be less than zero, a primary surplus. If d is positive and i < g, p can be greater than zero, a primary deficit.",

                  "Rodrigo de Rato: The IMF in a changing world (keynote address) Keynote address by Mr Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, at the Joint IMF-Bundesbank Symposium \"The IMF in a changing world\", Frankfurt, DATE.    Thank you, Mr. Stark, for that opening and introduction. Good TIME - It is a great pleasure to be here DATE among this impressive gathering of experts from many countries. Let me first thank the German authorities for graciously hosting this conference. Their organization of this event is much appreciated. As you know, the IMF was established DATE. The world economy has witnessed dramatic changes since that time. For instance, our membership has grown four-fold, from around NUM to NUM. The world's financial landscape has also been dramatically altered by the rise of private international capital flows. Throughout the changes of DATE, the IMF has continually evolved to meet the needs of its members and the international economic system. It is in that spirit of evolution and renewal that we meet DATE to discuss issues related to the international monetary system, financial stability and, more broadly, the IMF's role in the world economy. My remarks this TIME may be conveniently divided into three sections:  The origins of the IMF, addressing its purposes, objectives, and mandates.  Main changes to the IMF since its establishment, and the reasons for those changes.  Some thoughts on the future role of the IMF in the international monetary system. In going through these subjects, it is my hope that the developments and ideas in each section will provide useful context for your panel discussions later DATE. The IMF and its origins We live DATE in a highly globalized and integrated world. However, some analysts may suggest that the global economy was actually more integrated at DATE than it is now. In DATE, nationalism and protectionism disrupted this integration, setting off the Great Depression and contributing to World War II. The IMF - and the World Bank, its sister institution - were established to restore an open system of trade and finance, help countries rebuild from the war and, in the process, hopefully build a new era of world peace and prosperity. Against that background, a key part of the IMF's mandate DATE is the promotion and maintenance of monetary and financial stability, both in individual countries and at the international level. Stability is the foundation for sustained economic growth, and crisis prevention and resolution is an integral part of our work. The IMF discharges this mandate in a variety of ways, including the following. First, it provides the framework and mechanisms for international economic cooperation. With increasing integration in the world economy, the importance of this aspect cannot be overstated. Second, it helps countries design macroeconomic policies that achieve and maintain high levels of employment and income. The promotion of open economies and trade is a key element of these policies. Third, the IMF helps in the orderly correction of a country's balance of payments problems by providing temporary financing. The ways in which we carry out our operations are also unique in several respects. Broadly-speaking, these may be divided into three categories of activities:  Surveillance - This involves the monitoring of economic and financial conditions, both at the global level and in individual countries. For the IMF, surveillance is a central instrument for maintaining monetary and financial stability. By obliging each IMF member to engage in a regular consultation with us on its economic policies, the surveillance process also explicitly recognizes the role that all countries play in maintaining global stability.  Lending - Our financing role is focused in assisting members with balance of payments adjustments. Through the temporary provision of funds, IMF lending gives members breathing room to implement policy measures to overcome underlying economic problems. For the poorest countries, financing may be provided on concessional terms, and with longer maturities. The availability of IMF funds to assist in economic adjustment gives confidence to members and the international system as a whole, since it lowers the incentive for countries to take adjustment measures which are damaging to the national and international economies.  Technical Assistance - Technical advice and assistance is provided to member countries in areas of the IMF's expertise, primarily in macroeconomic and financial policymaking. By helping to build institutional and human capacity for the making of sound economic policies, IMF technical assistance contributes to the building of strong economies and stable growth. The IMF's purposes, and its operational activities, were therefore designed with a key objective in mind - that is, the fostering of healthy national economies, linked by finance and trade, as the foundation for a robust global economic system. I think it correct to say that this vision for international peace and stability has produced remarkable results, for DATE have been a period of growing economic prosperity and freedom. Global per capita income has more than tripled, and most of the world has experienced major improvements in literacy and life expectancy. Among the biggest gainers have been the developing nations, home to half of the world's population. Many of them have been quick to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the global economy, especially during DATE. These countries - whose ranks include Brazil, Chile, China, India, Korea, and Mexico - were able to double their share in world trade, raise per capita incomes, and lift millions out of poverty. Their experience demonstrates that integration into the global economy can bring major benefits. The IMF's evolution The world has witnessed many changes and developments - in technology, politics, culture, as well as economics - over DATE, and the IMF has adapted itself accordingly. At the time of IMF's establishment, our economic policy advice focused mainly on helping members to shape sound macroeconomic and financial policies, within the disciplines of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. The breakdown of that system in DATE, and the resultant Second Amendment of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, led to a re-orientation of the IMF's functions. In particular, the revision of Article IV, and the introduction of the surveillance process, explicitly recognized the close relationship between domestic economic policies and international stability. To DATE, this forms the basis for our systematic and comprehensive review of economic conditions and policies in each member country. Similarly, the wave of de-colonization that swept the world from DATE onwards placed new and complex responsibilities on the Fund. The IMF quickly found that countries looked to it for advice and assistance beyond the traditional macroeconomic areas of fiscal policy, monetary policy, and exchange rate systems. In addition to these subjects, IMF advice and assistance were also sought on establishing the institutions of monetary and fiscal policy, and on supply-side structural policies to help promote sustained growth. In DATE, following DATE the Cold War, new challenges were created in this regard by the transition of former centrally-planned economies to market-based systems. Through our work in these areas, it also became increasingly clear that structural and institutional issues were important for stability and growth in other member countries too, including the major industrial economies. The area of IMF financing has also seen great transformation. For example, although IMF lending continues to be targeted at short-term balance of payments needs, our financing instruments have, for DATE, included concessional lending for low-income countries. In response to the rapid development of international capital markets as a major source of financing for countries, special IMF financing policies have also been put in place to assist countries facing capitalaccount driven crises. Related to these capital market developments, the Fund also began to play an unanticipated role in facilitating the resolution of sovereign debt problems. This function became critically important following the emergence of the debt crisis in DATE, and it remains so DATE. All of these changes - ranging from de-colonization and transition, to the rapid development of private international capital flows and new instruments, to the emergence of capital-account driven crises - posed new challenges for the IMF. In many cases, these developments touched upon issues which lay at the frontiers of economic knowledge and research. Addressing them has led to a significant transformation of the Fund, including a broadening of the skills mix of Fund staff, greater dialogue with private financial sectors, and more involvement in institutional development in member countries. In the process, the IMF has also become a more open and transparent institution. Meeting the needs of the future To continue to serve the interests of our member countries and the international community at large, the IMF has to be in a position to deal with the influences that are expected to shape the global economy in DATE. We must not remain static, nor must we change only in a reactive manner when forced to. For that reason, I have initiated an examination of the Fund's medium-term strategic direction. We hope to use this opportunity to explore a variety of issues and their implications for the work of the IMF. These include matters like global financial flows, regional integration, efforts to reduce poverty, and questions concerning global governance, transparency, and accountability. We are still in the early stages of the review, and there have been many preliminary ideas floated and discussed. At this juncture, it is important for all of us to remain flexible and open-minded, particularly to views and opinions from outside the IMF. However, there is a sense that the continuing evolution of the Fund must remain grounded in the institution's key areas of responsibility, as specified in our Articles of Agreement - that is, to facilitate international monetary cooperation, to foster a liberal system of international trade and payments, and to promote macroeconomic and financial stability, as a condition for sustained growth. As we ponder how best to meet the challenges of the future, there appears a strong case that the IMF should remain anchored to its core macroeconomic and financial areas of mandate and expertise. The Fund's governing organs - including our Executive Board and the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) - are already actively engaged in this review. They have had various occasions to consider this matter, and I would like to use this opportunity to present some of the key ideas that have emerged in discussion, in the following five areas: surveillance, financial sector and capital markets work, Fund financing and lending, our assistance to low-income countries, and internal management and governance. First, on surveillance, both the IMF's Executive Board and the IMFC share my vision that a central task of the Fund lies in a stronger and better-focused surveillance process. IMF surveillance provides the foundation for cooperation among our members in the promotion of stability and growth in the global economy. With increased trade and financial linkages among nations, and strong connections between economic performance, poverty, and security issues, such cooperation to address shared problems is now more important than ever. For instance, the IMF has repeatedly pointed to the need to address current global imbalances, so as to reinforce the basis for more balanced and sustainable global growth. The existing relatively benign global outlook provides an excellent window of opportunity to do that, and the IMF serves as a ready vehicle through which to cooperate on the necessary actions. With respect to individual countries, we should continue working to strengthen the bilateral surveillance process. While focused on the country at hand, it would be important that bilateral surveillance be fully-informed by regional and global perspectives as well. Systemically important countries will clearly continue to deserve special attention. Operationally, our respective country teams will remain the focal points for our activities in individual members. At the same time, country teams will continue to draw upon specialized expertise where necessary, from both inside and outside of the Fund. To maintain overall coherence, it would be important for efforts to continue in the integration and sharing of information among country teams and specialized experts. Second, our work in financial sectors and capital markets. The IMF is the one international organization capable of carrying out financial sector surveillance universally and comprehensively. Further efforts will be needed to realize this potential, not least by deepening the IMF's role in anticipating sources of instability in national and global financial markets, and in generating timely action to address them. The IMF will continue to help countries strengthen their financial sectors, including in following up on the findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercises. One important aspect of this will be to help members adapt their prudential and administrative frameworks to benefit more from private capital flows. As national financial sectors become increasingly integrated and interdependent, another top priority for us must be to strengthen our understanding of the factors that drive global capital asset allocation, and the reasons for capital flows across sectors and national borders. Early identification and assessment of capital flows will help us evaluate vulnerabilities in a timely manner, as well as enhance countries' ability to address them. The effectiveness of our bilateral and multilateral surveillance activities will also be strengthened as a result. For members who wish to access international capital markets and integrate their economies more fully into the global financial system, we can provide advice on the appropriate sequencing of measures, such as how to strengthen their financial sectors and reduce their vulnerability to shocks as preparatory steps. Third, IMF financing and lending. The Fund's traditional role of providing financing to help smooth the adjustment of temporary current-account imbalances remains vital for many countries. For others, our main task is to help prevent, or mitigate, capital account crises and their cross-border contagion effects. To succeed in these roles, the IMF must be able to exercise selectivity in supporting only those adjustment programs that will put the relevant members firmly on the path to external viability. The existence of robust domestic institutional frameworks, and strong national ownership of programs, would be key. Building on these principles, we will continue working towards a clearer consensus on the appropriate circumstances and scale for IMF lending, the possible need for additional financial instruments, and the adequacy of the present framework for the orderly resolution of sovereign debt problems. Fourth, the Fund's role in low-income countries. Low-income countries present the international community with some profound challenges. Over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, and hundreds of millions are affected by disease. Addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, in particular, will be critical for growth and poverty reduction in many developing countries. Achieving durable economic growth in these countries - which is essential for lasting poverty reduction and reaching the Millennium Development Goals - will therefore require a strong social framework as well as sound economic policies. On our part, the IMF can help countries put in place policies and systems to effectively manage the increased and large inflows of aid that could be forthcoming in response to the HIV/AIDs crisis. Importantly, lasting poverty reduction can only be achieved with stable and sustained growth. The IMF, with our mandate in promoting economic stability, can help countries to put in place strong macroeconomic frameworks that will lead to economic expansion and debt sustainability. As in everything else that we do, we must ensure that our assistance to low-income countries continues to fit their particular needs and circumstances. Some issues which may warrant closer examination include:  Ensuring that resources in the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility - our main lending instrument for developing countries - remain adequate to meet future demands;  New ways to help low-income countries deal with economic shocks;  In the case of low-income countries which do not need or want IMF lending, how to enhance the IMF's role in signaling to others the strength of these countries' policies;  The role of the Fund in supporting low-income countries' poverty reduction strategies; and  Our relationship with donors and aid agencies. As a partner of the DATE Monterrey Consensus, the IMF is committed to supporting countries in their efforts to reduce poverty and reach the Millennium Development Goals. Our unique position gives us the potential to contribute to building both pillars of the Monterrey Consensus. On one side, we can work with countries to design policies and build institutions that will help them grow out of poverty. On the other, we can advocate for more and better international support, and help with its coordination. Nevertheless, examining the issues highlighted earlier will help frame a better understanding of the areas of low-income country work for which the IMF can take responsibility, and those that will fall to other institutions and actors. It would be helpful to have greater definition in this area as we approach the U.N. Millennium Summit in DATE. To maintain the IMF's effectiveness, it is Fifth, the IMF's internal governance and management. essential for our membership to resolve the difficult issues that have been raised about our own governance - notably, the voice and participation of emerging market economies and developing countries in our institution. All members countries should have adequate voice and participation in the IMF's decision-making, and the distribution of our quotas should reflect developments in the global economy. In this connection, the ongoing 13th general review of IMF quotas provides an opportunity to make progress on this front. Further, given the demands placed on the IMF by its members, it is clear that the institution's resources must be commensurate with the tasks it is asked to perform. This ongoing strategic review will help us to identify needs, define priorities, and consider possibilities to redeploy resources from lower-priority areas. Regardless of the outcome, IMF management, and our Executive Board, are committed to making the most effective use of resources entrusted to them by our membership. Efforts must therefore continue in the search for greater efficiency gains. One important aspect of this concerns the cooperation and division of labor between the IMF, the World Bank, and other international organizations. This is an issue which may bear revisiting, and I am very much looking forward to working with President Wolfowitz, and to learning his views and vision for the Bank. Conclusion This conference's organizers have put together an excellent program that addresses many of the points I have touched upon - from international financial stability, to capital market integration, to financial crisis resolution, to IMF governance. In these and other areas, work is underway on a medium-term strategy that will guide the IMF's priorities and decision-making over DATE. Your discussions will therefore provide valuable insights for that medium-term strategy, which we hope to finalize by the time of the DATE Annual Meetings in DATE. Subsequently, I anticipate that the debate on longer-term issues, relating for instance to global governance and the future structure of the international monetary system, will continue, both within and outside the Fund. I look forward to your contributions to that debate as well. Thank you once again for your presence and participation in this symposium. As we consider how the IMF can best serve its membership and the world, it is indeed a great privilege to be able to tap into your wealth of experience and knowledge on some of the issues that lie at the heart of our institution's mandate.",

                  "Alan Greenspan: Current account Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Economic Club of New York, New York, DATE.    It has been a number of DATE since the foreign exchange rate of the dollar has played so prominent a role in evaluations of economic activity. I have no intention DATE of discussing the foreign exchange policy of the United States. That is the province of the Secretary of the Treasury. Nor do I intend to project exchange rates. My experience is that exchange markets have become so efficient that virtually all relevant information is embedded almost instantaneously in exchange rates to the point that anticipating movements in major currencies is rarely possible. The exceptions to this conclusion are those few cases of successful speculation in which governments have tried and failed to support a particular exchange rate. Nonetheless, despite extensive efforts on the part of analysts, to my knowledge, no model projecting directional movements in exchange rates is significantly superior to tossing a coin. I am aware that of the thousands who try, some are quite successful. So are winners of coin-tossing contests. The seeming ability of a number of banking organizations to make consistent profits from foreign exchange trading likely derives not from their insight into future rate changes but from market making. This may seem a rather surprising conclusion, given that so many commentators apparently believe that they know the real value of the dollar must decline further because of the record current account deficit of the United States. It should be sobering to recall that three DATE ago - February NUM - to be exact for similar reasons a vast majority of a large panel of forecasters were projecting a lower dollar against the euro. In the subsequent DATE, the dollar rose nearly NUM percent against the euro. Rather than engage in exchange rate forecasting, DATE I will discuss certain developments in foreign exchange markets, and in the international financial system in general, which bear on the ultimate outcome of our current account adjustment process. Before raising the broader issues of adjustment, I should like to address the actions of certain of the players in the exchange market that are likely to delay the adjustment process, but only for a time. I refer to the heavy degree of intervention by East Asian monetary authorities, especially in Japan and China, and the apparent stepped up hedging of currency movements by exporters, especially in Europe. As all of you who follow these markets are aware, since DATE, the extraordinary purchases by Asian central banks and governments of dollar assets, largely those by Japan and China, have totaled almost $NUM billion, all in an apparent attempt to prevent their currencies from rising against the dollar. In particular, total foreign exchange reserves for China reached $NUM billion in DATE and for Japan more than $NUM billion in DATE. The awesome size of Japan's accumulation results from persistent intervention to suppress what Japanese authorities have judged is a dollar-yen exchange rate that is out of line with fundamentals. One factor boosting the yen is a significant yen bias on the part of Japanese investors. This propensity, in my judgment, runs far beyond the normal tendency of investors worldwide to buy familiar domestic assets and eschew foreign-exchange risk. Nowhere else in the world will investors voluntarily purchase DATE government obligations at an interest rate of NUM percent or less, especially given a rate of increase in the outstanding supply of government debt that has generally been running at NUM percent over DATE. Not surprisingly, very few Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are held outside of Japan. Aside from the holdings of the Bank of Japan, almost all JGBs are held by Japanese households, banks, insurance companies and the postal saving system. And none of them holds significant amounts of foreign assets; NUM percent of household assets are in yen, and, including the postal saving system, about NUM percent of the assets of financial institutions are in yen. Japanese nonfinancial corporations do hold a larger share of foreign assets in their securities' portfolios, but the absolute amounts are small. The Japanese have made significant foreign direct investments, especially in the United States, and the Ministry of Finance does, of course, hold large dollar balances as a consequence of exchange rate intervention. But the Japanese private sector, by and large, has exhibited limited interest in accumulating dollar or other foreign assets, removing what in other large trading economies would be a significant segment of demand for foreign assets. The degree of domestic currency bias in Japan, which far exceeds that of its trading partners, may thus have contributed to a foreign exchange rate for the yen that appears to be elevated relative to the dollar and possibly other internationally traded currencies as well.NUM Of course, this preference for yen assets, while a persistent influence on the value of the yen, has at times been overwhelmed by other factors. Granted the level of intervention pursued by the Japanese monetary authorities has influenced the market value of the yen, but the size of the impact is difficult to judge. In any event, it must be presumed that the rate of accumulation of dollar assets by the Japanese government will have to slow at some point and eventually cease. For now, partially unsterilized intervention is perceived as a means of expanding the monetary base of Japan, a basic element of monetary policy. (The same effect, of course, is available through the purchase of domestic assets.) In time, however, as the present deflationary situation abates, the monetary consequences of continued intervention could become problematic. The current performance of the Japanese economy suggests that we are getting closer to the point where continued intervention at the present scale will no longer meet the monetary policy needs of Japan. China is a similar story. In order to maintain the tight relationship with the dollar initiated in DATE, the Chinese central bank has chosen to purchase large quantities of U.S. Treasury securities with renminbi. What is not clear is how much of the current upward pressure on the currency results from underlying market forces, how much from capital inflows owing to speculation on potential revaluation, and how much from capital controls that suppress the demand of Chinese residents for dollars and other currencies. No one truly knows whether easing or ending capital controls would lessen pressure on the currency and, in the process, also eliminate inflows from speculation on a revaluation. Many in China, however, fear that an immediate ending of controls could induce capital outflows large enough to destabilize the nation's improving, but still fragile, banking system. Others believe that decontrol, but at a gradual pace, could conceivably avoid such an outcome. Chinese central bank purchases of dollars, unless offset, threaten an excess of so-called high-powered money expansion and a consequent overheating of the Chinese economy. The Chinese central bank DATE offset - that is, sterilized - much of its heavy dollar purchases by reducing its loans to commercial banks, by selling bonds, and by increasing reserve requirements. But the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base in China has been rising steadily for a number of DATE as financial efficiency improves. Thus the modest rise that has occurred in currency and commercial bank reserves has been enough to support a DATE growth of the M2 money supply in the neighborhood of NUM percent through DATE and a bit less so far DATE. Should this pattern continue, the central bank will be confronted with the choice of curtailing its purchases of dollar assets or facing an overheated economy with the associated economic instabilities. Lesser dollar purchases presumably would allow the renminbi, at least temporarily, to appreciate against the dollar. Other East Asian monetary authorities, in an endeavor to hold their currencies at a par with the yen and the renminbi, accumulated about $NUM billion in reserves in DATE and appear to have continued that rate of intervention since.    There is a general view that this heavy intervention places upward pressure on the euro. It is assumed that the dollar's trade-weighted exchange rate reflects its worldwide fundamentals, and therefore if the Asian currencies are being suppressed, the euro and other non-Asian currencies need to appreciate as an offset. But a more likely possibility is that Asian currency intervention has had little effect on other currencies and that the trade-weighted average of the dollar is, thus, somewhat elevated relative to the rate that would have prevailed absent intervention. When Asian authorities intervene to ease their currencies against the dollar, they purchase dollar-denominated assets from private sector portfolios. With fewer dollar assets in private hands, the natural inclination to rebalance portfolios will tend to buoy the dollar even against currencies that are not used in intervention operations, including the euro. These transactions raise the dollar against, for example, the yen, lower the yen against the euro, and lower the euro against the dollar. The strength of the euro against the dollar thus appears to be the consequence of forces unrelated to Asian intervention. As I will explain later, this does not mean that when Asian intervention ceases the dollar will automatically fall because other influences on the dollar cannot be foreseen. Some have argued that purchases of U.S. Treasuries by Asian officials are holding down interest rates on these instruments, and therefore U.S. interest rates are likely to rise as intervention by Asian monetary authorities slows, ceases, or even turns to net sales. While there are obvious reasons to be concerned about such an outcome, the effect of a reduction in the scale of intervention, or even net sales, on U.S. financial markets would likely be small. The reason is that central bank reserves are heavily concentrated in short-term maturities; moreover, the overall market in short-term dollar assets, combining both public and private instruments, is huge relative to the size of asset holdings of Asian monetary authorities. And because these issues are short-term and hence capable of only limited price change, realized capital losses, if any, would be small. Accordingly, any incentive for monetary authorities to sell dollars, in order to preserve market value, would be muted.    A different issue arises with the apparent level of hedging by exporters in Europe and elsewhere. The effect, however, is the same as Asian official intervention: It slows the process of adjustment. Against a broad basket of currencies of our trading partners, the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar has declined about NUM percent from its peak in DATE. Ordinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in the dollar prices of our imported goods and services, because foreign exporters seek to avoid price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Reflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and services imported into the United States have begun to rise after declining on balance for several DATE. But the turnaround to date has been moderate and far short of that implied by the exchange rate change. Apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to absorb some of the price decline measured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on profit margins it entails in order to hold market share. In fact, given that the nearly NUM percent rise in dollar prices of goods imported from western Europe since DATE has been far short of the rise in the euro, profit margins of euro-area exporters to the United States may well have turned negative. Nonetheless, euro-area exports to the United States, when expressed in euros, have slowed only modestly. A possible reason is that European exporters' incentives to sell to the United States were diminished significantly less than indicated by the dollar price and exchange rate movements owing to accelerated short forward positions against the dollar in foreign exchange markets. A marked increase in foreign exchange derivative trading, especially in dollar-euro, according to the Bank for International Settlements, is consistent with increased hedging of exports to the United States and to other markets that use currencies tied to the U.S. dollar.NUM However, most contracts are short-term because long-term hedging is expensive. Thus, although hedging may delay, and perhaps even smooth out, the adjustment, it cannot eliminate, without prohibitive cost, the consequences of exchange rate change. Accordingly, the currency depreciation that we have experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as foreign producers export less to the United States. On the other side of the ledger, the current account should improve as U.S. firms find the export market more receptive. But in the process, dollar prices of imports will surely rise.    When the temporary forestalling of the U.S. balance of payments adjustment process comes to an end, does that suggest a steepening of the decline in the dollar's exchange rate? As I pointed out in the beginning, the most sophisticated analytical techniques have been unable to profitably project the exchange rates of major currencies. Yet, most commentators argue that because the current account deficit must eventually narrow, the price-adjusted value of the dollar must accordingly decline. But how can exchange rates and the current account be systematically related, if exchange rates are inherently unpredictable? The answer is that the point at which the U.S. current account deficit will be forced to narrow is itself inherently difficult to predict. The current account reflects the myriad forces that bring our transactions with foreign economies into balance at our borders, of which exchange rates are only one. But those forces that, in the end, are reflected in a current account surplus or deficit are both domestic and foreign. Indeed, our current account balance can be shown to be exactly equal to the difference between domestic saving and domestic investment. In fact, it is often instructive in longer-term analysis to view our current account in terms of its domestic counterparts. As I pointed out in a speech last November,NUM virtually all of our trading partners share our inclination to invest a disproportionate percentage of domestic savings in domestic capital assets, irrespective of their differential rates of return. People seem to prefer to invest in familiar local businesses even where currency and country risks do not exist. For the United States, studies have shown that individual investors and even professional money managers have a slight preference for investments in their own communities and states. Trust, so crucial an aspect of investing, is most likely to be fostered by the familiarity of local communities. As a consequence, \"home bias\" will likely continue to constrain the movement of world savings into its optimum use as capital investment, thus limiting the internationalization of financial intermediation and hence the growth of external assets and liabilities and the dispersion of world current account balances that such growth implies. Nonetheless, during DATE, home bias has apparently declined significantly. For most of the earlier post World War II era, the correlation between domestic saving rates and domestic investment rates across the world's major economies, a conventional measure of home bias, was exceptionally high.NUM For the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) , the GDP-weighted correlation coefficient was NUM in DATE. However, it fell from NUM in DATE to less than NUM in DATE. For OECD countries excluding the United States, the recent decline is even more pronounced. These declines, not surprisingly, mirror the rise in the differences between saving and investment or, equivalently, of the dispersion of current account balances over the same DATE. The decline in home bias probably reflects an increased international tendency for financial systems to be more transparent, open, and supportive of strong investor protection.NUM Moreover, vast improvements in information and communication technologies have broadened investors' vision to the point that foreign investment appears less exotic and risky. Accordingly, the trend of declining home bias and expanding international financial intermediation will likely continue. This process has enabled the United States to incur and finance a much larger current account deficit than would have been feasible in DATE. It is quite difficult to contemplate foreign savings in an amount equivalent to NUM percent of U.S. GDP being transferred to the United States DATE.    It is unclear whether the burden of servicing our growing external liabilities or the rising weight of U.S. assets in global portfolios will impose the greater restraint on current account dispersion over the longer term. Either way, when that point arrives, will the process of reining in our current account deficit be benign to the economies of the United States and the world? According to a Federal Reserve staff study, current account deficits that emerged among developed countries since DATE have risen as high as double-digit percentages of GDP before markets enforced a reversal.NUM The median high has been about NUM percent of GDP. Complicating the evaluation of the timing of a turnaround is that deficit countries, both developed and emerging, borrow in international markets largely in dollars rather than in their domestic currency. The United States has been rare in its ability to finance its external deficit in a reserve currency. This ability has presumably enlarged the capability of the United States relative to most of our trading partners to incur foreign debt. Besides experiences with the current account deficits of other countries, there are few useful guideposts of how high our country's net foreign liabilities can mount. The foreign accumulation of U.S. assets would likely slow if dollar assets, irrespective of their competitive return, came to occupy too large a share of the world's portfolio of store of value assets. In these circumstances, investors would seek greater diversification in non-dollar assets. At the end of DATE, U.S. dollars accounted for about NUM percent of the foreign exchange reserves of foreign monetary authorities, with the euro second at NUM percent. Approximately half of private cross-border holdings were denominated in dollars, with one-third in euros.    More important than the way that the adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit will be initiated is the effect of the adjustment on both our economy and the economies of our trading partners. The history of such adjustments has been mixed. According to the aforementioned Federal Reserve study of current account corrections in developed countries, although the large majority of episodes were characterized by some significant slowing of economic growth, most economies managed the adjustment without crisis. The institutional strengths of many of these developed economies - rule of law, transparency, and investor and property protection - likely helped to minimize disruptions associated with current account adjustments. The United Kingdom, however, had significant adjustment difficulties in its early postwar DATE, as did, more recently, Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Russia, Brazil, and Argentina, to name just a few. Can market forces incrementally defuse a worrisome buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so? The answer seems to lie with the degree of flexibility in both domestic and international markets. In domestic economies that approach full flexibility, imbalances are likely to be adjusted well before they become potentially destabilizing. In a similarly flexible world economy, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates could change, presumably to reestablish global balance. The experience over DATE of trade and finance among the individual states that make up the United States comes close to that paradigm of flexibility even though exchange rates among the states have been fixed. Although we have scant data on cross-border transactions among the separate states, anecdotal evidence suggests that over DATE significant apparent imbalances have been resolved without precipitating interstate balance of payments crises. The dispersion of unemployment rates among the states, one measure of imbalances, spikes during periods of economic stress but rapidly returns to modest levels, reflecting a high degree of adjustment flexibility. That flexibility is even more apparent in regional money markets, where interest rates that presumably reflect differential imbalances in states' current accounts and hence cross-border borrowing requirements have, in recent DATE, exhibited very little interstate dispersion. This observation suggests either negligible cross-state-border imbalances, an unlikely occurrence given the pattern of state unemployment dispersion, or more likely very rapid financial adjustments.    We may not be able to usefully determine at what point foreign accumulation of net claims on the United States will slow or even reverse, but it is evident that the greater the degree of international flexibility, the less the risk of a crisis.NUM The experience of the United States over the past three DATE is illustrative. The apparent ability of our economy to withstand a number of severe shocks since DATE, with only a small decline in real GDP, attests to the marked increase in our economy's flexibility over DATE century.NUM    In evaluating the nature of the adjustment process, we need to ask whether there is something special in the dollar being the world's primary reserve currency. With so few historical examples of dominant world reserve currencies, we are understandably inclined to look to the experiences of the dollar's immediate predecessor. At the height of sterling's role as the world's currency DATE, Great Britain had net external assets amounting to some NUM percent of its DATE GDP, most of which were lost in World Wars I and II. Britain in the early post World War II period was hobbled with periodic sterling crises when much of the remnants of Empire endeavored to disengage themselves from heavy reliance on holding sterling assets as central bank reserves and private stores of value. The experience of Britain's then extensively regulated economy, harboring many wartime controls well beyond the end of hostilities, provides testimony to the costs of structural rigidity in times of crisis.    Should globalization be allowed to proceed and thereby create an ever more flexible international financial system, history suggests that the odds are favorable that current imbalances will be defused with little disruption to the economy or financial markets. But there are other outcomes that are less benign, and we must endeavor to limit the likelihood of these outcomes. One avenue by which to lessen the risk of a more difficult adjustment is for us to restore fiscal discipline. The rise in national saving that would accompany a reduction in the federal budget deficit will alleviate some of the burden of adjustment that would otherwise be required of the private sector through movements in asset prices. Even more worrisome than the lack of fiscal restraint are the clouds of emerging protectionism that have become increasingly visible on DATE's horizon. Over the DATE, protected interests have often endeavored to stop in its tracks the process of unsettling economic change. Pitted against the powerful forces of market competition, virtually all such efforts have failed. The costs of any new such protectionist initiatives, in the context of wide current account imbalances, could significantly erode the flexibility of the global economy. Consequently, it is imperative that creeping protectionism be thwarted and reversed.",

The free movement of capital across borders has created, and will certainly continue to create, enormous economic benefits. Capital flows afford developing countries and other regions the means to exploit promising investment opportunities, while providing savers around the globe the means both to earn higher returns and to reduce risk through international portfolio diversification. Access to international capital markets also permits nations to accumulate foreign assets in good times and to deplete those assets or to borrow in bad times, mitigating the effects on living standards of shocks to domestic income and production. In DATE, global capital flows have attained record highs relative to global income, reflecting both the powerful tendency of capital to seek the highest return and a concerted international effort to dismantle political and regulatory barriers to capital mobility. The issue I would like to address DATE is the role of monetary policy, and in particular the choice of the exchange rate regime, in enabling economies to take the maximum advantage of the increasing openness and depth of international capital markets. I should begin by noting that the views I will express DATE are my responsibility and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.NUM The discussion of monetary policy and capital flows almost inevitably begins with the well-known \"trilemma,\" the observation that a country can choose no more than two of the following three features of its policy regime: (NUM) free capital mobility across borders, (NUM) a fixed exchange rate, and (NUM) an independent monetary policy.NUM Various combinations of these features have dominated world monetary arrangements in different eras. Under the classical gold standard of DATE, the major trading countries chose the benefits of free capital flows and the perceived stability of a fixed relation of their currency to gold; of necessity, then, they largely abjured independent monetary policies. Under the Bretton Woods system created at the end of World War II, many countries renounced capital mobility in an attempt to maintain both fixed exchange rates and monetary independence. Currently, among the major industrial regions at least, we have collectively chosen a regime that gives up fixed exchange rates in favor of the other two elements. Is the international monetary regime that is in place DATE the best one for the world? For the economically advanced nations that use the world's three key currencies - the euro, the yen, and the dollar - I believe that the benefits of independent monetary policies and capital mobility greatly exceed whatever costs may result from a regime of floating exchange rates. My view is widely - though not universally - shared among economists and policymakers. In particular, what was once viewed as the principal objection to floating exchange rates, that their adoption would leave the system bereft of a nominal anchor, has proven to be unfounded. Most countries DATE, including many emerging-market and developing nations as well as the advanced industrial countries, have succeeded in establishing a commitment to keeping domestic inflation low and stable, a commitment that has served effectively as a nominal anchor. A newer critique of floating exchange rates contends that exchange rates are more volatile than can be explained by the macroeconomic fundamentals and, moreover, that this excess volatility has in some cases inhibited international trade (Flood and Rose, DATE; Rose, DATE; Klein and Shambaugh, DATE). Like other asset prices, floating exchange rates do indeed exhibit a great deal of volatility in the very short term, responding to many types of economic news and, sometimes it seems, to no news at all. Whether this very short-term volatility is excessive relative to fundamentals (which are inherently difficult to observe and measure) is debatable. In any case, this short-term volatility seems unlikely to have substantial effects on trade or capital flows, as short-term fluctuations in exchange rates are easily hedged. Exchange rates also exhibit long-horizon volatility, of course; but, although the swings in the exchange value of the dollar over DATE have been large, so have been the changes in the global macroeconomic environment. As key components of the international adjustment mechanism, fluctuations in exchange rates and the associated financial flows have often played an important stabilizing role. For example, the sharp rise in the dollar in DATE reflected to an important degree a surge in U.S. productivity growth, which raised perceived rates of return and attracted significant inflows of capital. The capital inflows, the stronger dollar, and the associated rise in imports worked together to permit increased capital investment in the United States during that period, enabling production and incomes to grow without overheating the economy or requiring a sustained rise in interest rates. The value of floating exchange rates as shock absorbers might make their adoption worthwhile even if their volatility did have a chilling effect on trade. However, the sharp rise in trade volumes relative to world gross domestic product in DATE suggests to me that, at least for the world as a whole, any such chilling effect has likely been minor. The presumption in favor of allowing the market to determine the exchange rates among the major currencies is strengthened by the fact that a consensus about the appropriate levels at which to peg these currencies would be difficult to obtain. A poor choice of the rates at which currencies would trade could condemn one or more regions to unwanted inflation and the other regions to economic stagnation for a transition period that could easily DATE. The United Kingdom suffered the consequences of a poor choice of peg when it returned to the gold standard after World War I, as an overvalued pound reduced British exports and significantly worsened the country's unemployment problem. The United Kingdom faced analogous problems DATE, when it entered the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in DATE at a parity that again disadvantaged British exports and contributed to Great Britain's worst recession in DATE. Nor were these macroeconomic costs compensated for by greater external stability; in both episodes, doubts about the sustainability of the peg generated speculative attacks that ultimately forced the pound off its fixed rate. Overall, the case for floating exchange rates among the United States, Japan, and the euro zone seems to me to be compelling. For smaller industrial countries, the case for floating rates may in some instances be less clear-cut, for example, when the bulk of a country's trade is with a single, large trading partner. Generally, though, my sense is that the benefits of floating exchange rates exceed the costs for these countries as well. Much more controversial is the question of how developing and emerging-market countries should resolve the trilemma. Some might argue against these countries' choosing to allow free capital mobility on the grounds that rapid reversals in international capital flows have induced balance of payments crises and difficult domestic adjustments for them in the past. But even those most concerned about potential instability in international capital flows would have to admit that comprehensive capital controls, if applied for any extended period, might solve one problem at the cost of creating a more serious one - namely, the inhibition of growth and development that occurs when nations lack access to international capital markets. At best, then, restrictions on capital mobility should be viewed as a temporary expedient, a second-best or third-best solution to the problems presented by flawed or immature institutions in a nation at early or intermediate stages of development. In the medium run, the better approach - admittedly, one not always so easy to implement - is to commit to making the nation's legal, regulatory, and fiscal framework stronger and more transparent. If foreign investors are thus reassured that their capital will be employed efficiently and its returns repatriated smoothly, the risks of capital flow reversals under a regime of free capital mobility should be much reduced. If we agree that every country should set a goal of achieving at least some degree of capital mobility, then the trilemma for developing countries ultimately boils down to the choice between flexible exchange rates (and the associated independence of monetary policy) and fixed rates (which do not allow monetary independence). For the remainder of my remarks I will focus on that choice. I should acknowledge immediately that to state the choice as one of \"fixed versus floating\" is to oversimplify. Both types of regime are actually broad categories, each of which contains a number of variants. Fixed exchange rates are almost never irrevocably fixed, for example: Crawling pegs allow the rate to be adjusted in a controlled manner, while some putatively fixed rates are actually re-set at frequent intervals, either as an instrument of policy or under external pressure. So-called hard pegs, including currency boards and dollarization, may draw credibility from various institutional impediments to changing the rate; but even full dollarization can be reversed, as Liberia proved in NUM Floating exchange rates cover an even wider range of policy behavior than fixed rates - from full reliance on the foreign exchange market for the determination of the exchange rate to a carefully managed float. So what should developing countries do about the exchange rate? Theory suggests that any group of countries whose economic structures and trade linkages satisfy the requirements of an optimum currency area, in the sense of Mundell (DATE), would be well served by fixing the exchange rates among their currencies or, even better, by forming a currency union.NUM However, in practice, empirical analyses have generally been unsuccessful at identifying multi-country regions of any size that meet the criteria for an optimum currency area. Indeed, some studies have concluded that even the United States and the European Union, the largest currency unions, are themselves not optimum currency areas.NUM Plausibly, political rather than economic considerations - namely, the desire to form a more NUM perfect union - underlay the decisions of each of these entities to adopt a common currency.NUM, Besides countries well-suited for a currency union, a second group of countries that might conceivably be better off with a fixed exchange rate, at least for a time, are the very poorest and least developed countries, which may lack the institutional infrastructure to effectively operate an independent monetary policy. In these countries, a hard peg or even the adoption of the currency of a major trading partner - sometimes known as dollarization, although the term also refers to cases in which the currency adopted is one other than the dollar - may be policy options worth considering. (I want to be clear that I am speaking generally and am not advocating that other countries adopt the U.S. currency.) Although dollarization has the advantage of making monetary policy essentially automatic and should be an effective device for controlling inflation, one is struck by the fact that so few countries have chosen this approach. Costs of dollarization include the loss of revenue from money creation and the reduced ability of the central bank to serve as a lender of last resort. But perhaps the most important impediment to dollarization is that, in giving up their own currency, the country's citizens may feel that they are losing an important symbol of the nation's sovereignty and pride. For other developing and emerging-market countries, I would argue that the best course is generally to let the exchange rate float freely and to make low and stable inflation a principal focus of monetary policy. As I have already suggested, this approach makes the targeted inflation rate, and not the exchange rate or some other variable, the nominal anchor of the system. An important reason for making the inflation rate (more precisely, the price level) the nominal anchor is that the general price level is more directly linked to economic welfare than is the exchange rate. Domestic price stability improves the operation of markets, reduces the costs associated with economizing on money holdings and with changing prices, lessens distortions associated with imperfect indexing of the tax system and the accounting system, and aids long-term planning. As I have also already noted, concerns about the feasibility of this approach have been put to rest by the experience of DATE or so. Central banks in many countries, with either an explicit or an implicit inflation target, have demonstrated the capacity to keep inflation low and stable. Indeed, recent research suggests that the combination of an inflation target, central bank independence, and a market-determined exchange rate tends to reduce variability in both inflation and output, even in small open economies such as Finland and NUM When the parity is nominally fixed but can be varied, and if capital flows are less than perfectly free, monetary policy under a fixed exchange rate may have a degree of independence; thus, the resolution of the trilemma may not be a stark choice of two of the three elements but a partial adoption of each. NUM An optimum currency area is a region in which labor and capital are internally mobile and sub-regions tend to be affected by similar shocks. As Mundell (DATE) first argued, in this situation the shock-absorbing benefits of flexible exchange rates are outweighed by the reduction in transactions costs and in uncertainty provided by fixed exchange rates or a common currency. NUM See, for example, Bayoumi and Eichengreen (DATE) and Ghosh and Wolf (DATE). NUM European economic integration has been motivated to a significant degree by a desire to make a repeat of the destructive conflicts of DATE impossible. In the fledgling United States, the desire to strengthen the central government was a principal reason behind Alexander Hamilton's advocacy of a common currency and common national debt. NUM On the other hand, recent research has pointed out the interesting possibility that the formation of a currency union, by promoting trade and economic integration among its members, may lead the criteria for an optimum currency area among the participating countries to be satisfied after the fact even if not before (Frankel and Rose, DATE). Of course, to justify a currency union on this basis requires the ability to forecast how linkages among the participants will evolve under the common currency, a difficult undertaking indeed. BIS Review NUM/DATE New Zealand (Truman, DATE). To be clear, a focus on domestic inflation does not imply that policymakers must entirely ignore the exchange rate; particularly in small open economies, stabilization of the domestic price level may entail some \"leaning against the wind\" with respect to exchange rate movements, because of their influence on domestic prices. This behavior does not imply that exchange rate stabilization is an independent objective, however; and should price stability and exchange rate stability come into conflict, it is the latter that should be jettisoned. In contrast to floating rates, fixed exchange rates - rather than being a mechanism for reducing macroeconomic instability - have often been a source of instability. Historically, governments have often defended their fixed parity even after the overvaluation of the exchange rate became obvious, leading to losses of foreign exchange reserves, a balance of payments crisis, and difficult domestic adjustments. Some observers have suggested that the solution to this problem is to tie the government's hands even more forcefully by imposing a harder peg, by means of a currency board or dollarization for example. But market participants know that promises to maintain a fixed rate are almost never irrevocable, and so a speculative attack is always possible (as Argentina recently learned, for example). Another strategy for deterring speculative attacks on a fixed exchange rate is to build a \"war chest\" of foreign-currency reserves. To be effective in DATE's world of highly mobile capital, the war chest may have to be sizable indeed; and for countries with large government debts and high domestic interest rates, holding great quantities of low-yielding reserves can have serious fiscal consequences. In any case, strategies to increase the defensibility of the peg ignore the broader issue of the role of the exchange rate in macroeconomic adjustment. For an individual country, forcing adjustment to a mis-valued exchange rate through domestic price changes is likely to be far more difficult and costly than an adjustment occurring through exchange rate depreciation or appreciation. For the world as a whole, macroeconomic adjustment may likewise be impeded if economically important countries attempt to maintain pegs at levels that differ from those dictated by fundamentals. If fixed exchange rates bear such risks, what explains their continued existence? One traditional argument in favor of fixed exchange rates for developing countries focuses on their usefulness in so-called heterodox programs for overcoming high inflation.NUM According to this view, the advantage of fixing the exchange rate as one element of an anti-inflation program (along with fiscal reforms and other policy changes) is that fixing the rate is more visible, more credible, and easier to explain than a commitment to stabilizing prices directly. Even if we grant a role for a fixed exchange rate in combating high inflation, however, this argument provides no rationale for fixing the rate indefinitely. If the program is successful and the inflationary psychology is broken, nothing prevents a transition from targeting the exchange rate to targeting inflation. Two countries with chronic inflation problems, Argentina and Brazil, did not experience a sustained resurgence of high inflation when they abandoned fixed rates in DATE. Brazil now targets inflation, and by some reports Argentina has considered the option. Israel broke the back of its hyperinflation in DATE with the aid of a fixed exchange rate but then made a gradual and successful transition to inflation targeting. And, of course, this argument provides no rationale for the use of fixed exchange rates by countries, such as the East Asian emerging-market countries, that have not experienced episodes of high inflation. An interesting recent explanation for the continued existence of fixed exchange rates is the so-called fear-of-floating phenomenon (Calvo and Reinhart, DATE). According to this view, the poor credibility of policymakers in some countries implies that the exchange rate, if left unmanaged, would prove excessively volatile. High exchange rate volatility could prove very harmful in these countries, for at least two reasons. First, the openness of these economies to trade, coupled with the fact that the exchange rate may serve as a focal point for inflation expectations, may imply that exchange rate volatility translates quickly into instability in consumer prices. Second, because firms and households in these countries often borrow in foreign currencies but receive revenues and incomes in the domestic currency, swings in the exchange rate have major effects on the net worth of these borrowers. In particular, a sharp devaluation, by raising the value of foreign liabilities relative to domestic assets, might bankrupt large segments of the economy, with severe financial and economic implications. According to the fear-of-floating hypothesis, the severe consequences of exchange rate volatility in these countries may lead policymakers to manage their currencies quite closely to damp volatility, no matter what the putative exchange rate regime. If we assume that the fear-of-floating hypothesis accurately describes behavior, what are the implications? Some have argued that, given the unwillingness to float, countries would be better off dollarizing or taking other measures to achieve a hard peg. This approach would have the benefits (the argument goes) of making explicit the country's implicit policy, making a disruptive devaluation less likely, and consequently, possibly reducing the risk premium that borrowers in the country must pay to borrow abroad. I have already expressed reservations about so-called hard pegs for developing countries: Though less so than conventional pegs, they remain subject to speculative attacks, and they may make domestic macroeconomic adjustment more difficult. They also constrain the central bank's ability to act as a lender of last resort in the event of a banking crisis. Moreover, the small amount of available evidence does not favor the view that a hard peg will significantly reduce the risk premium a country must pay on international loans; for example, the dollarized nations of El Salvador and Panama do not appear to be paying lower interest rate premiums on their debt than other similarly situated countries. Furthermore, to the extent that a hard peg encourages foreign-currency borrowing, the costs of devaluation, should it come, may be greatly increased. One may also question whether the fear of floating is a permanent and irremediable condition. An important underpinning of the fear-of-floating argument is the idea that borrowing and lending in international capital markets must take place only in a few key currencies, condemning most countries to borrow in a currency other than their own and exposing them to heavy losses in the event of a devaluation (Eichengreen and Hausman, DATE). In addition, because of creditor mistrust, the borrowing that does take place must be mostly in short-maturity instruments, greatly increasing the risk of a liquidity crisis. Continuing the tradition of colorful nomenclature in international economics, this hypothesis has been labeled \"original sin,\" because the need to borrow in foreign currencies and in short-maturity instruments supposedly constrains all but the largest and wealthiest countries regardless of economic policies and performance. However, recent developments in international capital markets challenge the inevitability of \"original sin\" (Eichengreen, Hausman, and Panizza, DATE; Burger and Warnock, DATE). First, some small countries have in fact been able to sell domestic-currency debt to foreigners (examples include New Zealand, Poland, and South Africa). Second, some developing countries have been able to establish active domestic credit markets in which borrowing may take place in long-term, fixed-rate debt, providing a partial substitute for foreigncurrency borrowing (examples include Chile, India, and Korea). In both situations, the quality of the country's macroeconomic policies as well as the strength and transparency of its institutional framework have been critically important for improving the access of borrowers to capital. Redemption from \"original sin\" through good works may thus be possible. These experiences suggest that, whatever interim arrangements they adopt regarding exchange rates and capital mobility, developing countries would do well to shift their focus to the task of building institutions, protecting property rights, and establishing a sound fiscal and monetary framework, with the ultimate goal of making free capital flows and a floating exchange rate feasible. In the wake of the Asian crisis, the conventional wisdom asserted that a country should eschew fixed exchange rates in favor of either of the two extremes: a floating rate or a currency union. I agree with this \"bipolar view\" insofar as I think that a garden-variety fixed exchange rate is, in most instances, the worst of all worlds. Notably, fixed exchange rates often result in irresistible one-way bets for speculators, with crisis and painful economic adjustment the likely result. Large holdings of foreign exchange reserves reduce this risk but create other costs. Currency unions are considerably less prone to speculative attack and may reduce uncertainty and transactions costs in international trade and finance. But as I have indicated DATE, I believe that floating exchange rates are generally to be preferred either to fixed exchange rates or - except in those relatively rare cases in which the criteria for an optimum currency area are met - to currency unions. This view seems to be spreading. According to the International Monetary Fund (DATE), for example, inflation-targeting countries are becoming more numerous as countries that fix the exchange rate become fewer.NUM Consistent with this observation, average inflation rates in both industrial and developing countries are near their lowest levels in DATE, reflecting the new emphasis in policy. Politicians and policymakers around the world are being converted to the idea that monetary policy should focus on delivering low and stable inflation, with the determination of exchange rates left to free markets. The most consequential exception to the general trend toward inflation stabilization, free capital markets, and floating exchange rates is, of course, China. China currently has relatively strict - though not absolutely impermeable - barriers to capital flows, as well as an exchange rate that is effectively pegged to the U.S. dollar. The governments of the United States and the other G-NUM countries have urged China to make the transition to a market-determined exchange rate, in the interest of promoting global macroeconomic adjustment. I will add here only that moving toward exchange rate flexibility is in the interest of China as well as the rest of the world. As a large, increasingly wealthy, and increasingly market-oriented economy, China will benefit from the shock-absorber properties of an independent monetary policy and a floating exchange rate. Because it needs capital to fuel its rapid growth and because its citizens would benefit greatly from the opportunity to invest their own savings abroad, China will likewise benefit from increased capital freedom. Finally, the institutional developments needed to support ever-more-open capital markets, including a strengthened legal and regulatory framework, an increased capacity of its banks to allocate capital to the most productive uses, and a reduced role of the government in investment decisions, are themselves necessary and important steps in China's economic modernization. The United States will also benefit as China and other East Asian countries make the transition to floating exchange rates and freer capital flows. More-open capital accounts and market-determined exchange rates will likely engender greater stability and improved resource allocation in Asia, setting the stage for sustained future growth. The development of the Asian economies will expand export markets for U.S. producers, particularly as independent monetary policies and institutional reform provide scope for stimulating demand by Asian households and firms. Some observers have expressed concern about the effects of reduced reserve accumulation by Asian central banks on U.S. bond markets; however, the U.S. bond market is extremely deep and has shown a remarkable capacity to handle transitions smoothly, particularly when they occur in a gradual and predictable manner. Moreover, under a regime of free capital mobility, private savers in China and the rest of East Asia may well wish to diversify into U.S. assets, including U.S. bonds. In summary, I have argued DATE for an international system based on the principles of flexible exchange rates, free capital mobility, and independent monetary policies, at least within the great majority of countries. Important complementary elements include free trade (though I have not discussed it DATE) and the further development of the \"soft\" infrastructure - the legal, regulatory, fiscal, and financial frameworks that characterize advanced economies. The fundamental virtue of this system is its flexibility and adaptability, qualities that will become increasingly essential in a complex and interdependent world.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Embracing the challenge of free trade - competing and prospering in a global economy Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Montana Economic Development Summit DATE, Butte, Montana, NUM May DATE. Trade is as old as humanity, or nearly so. Archaeological sites demonstrate that ancient peoples traded objects such as rare stones and shells across fairly long distances even in prehistoric times (Guisepi, DATE). Over DATE, with stops and starts, the volume of trade has expanded exponentially, driven in large part by advances in transportation and communication technologies. Steamships replaced sailing ships; railroads succeeded canal barges; the telegraph supplanted the Pony Express. DATE, in a world of container ships, jumbo jets, and the Internet, goods and many services are delivered faster and more cheaply (in inflation-adjusted terms) than ever before.NUM DATE I will discuss the crucial economic benefits we receive from the ongoing expansion of international trade. I will also address the adverse effects of trade and some possible ways to mitigate them. I will argue that one possible response to the dislocations that may result from trade - a retreat into protectionism and isolationism - would be self-defeating and, in the long run, probably not even feasible. Instead, our continued prosperity depends on our embracing the many opportunities provided by trade, even as we provide a helping hand to individuals and communities that may have suffered adverse consequences. The benefits of trade At the most basic level, trade is beneficial because it allows people to specialize in the goods and services they produce best and most efficiently. For example, we could conceivably all grow our own food and provide our own medical care. But because farming and medicine require special knowledge and skills, a far more efficient arrangement is for the farmer to specialize in growing food and for the doctor to specialize in treating patients. Through the specialization made possible by trade, the farmer can benefit from the doctor's medical knowledge and the doctor can enjoy lunch. The opportunity to trade allows everyone to play to his or her own strengths while benefiting from the productive skills of the whole community. Indeed, economists have demonstrated that trade between two people can be beneficial even if one of them is more skilled than the other at every task, so long as the more-skilled person specializes in those tasks at which he or she is relatively more productive. What applies to individuals applies to nations as well. DATE the economist David Ricardo famously observed that, if England specialized in making cloth while Portugal specialized in producing wine, international trade would allow both countries to enjoy more of both goods than would be possible if each country produced only for domestic consumption and did not trade. As in the case of individuals, this conclusion applies even if one country can produce both cloth and wine more cheaply than the other, so long as each country specializes in the activity at which it is relatively more productive. A telling confirmation of Ricardo's insight is that, when nations go to war, their first order of business is often to try to block the other's access to trade. In the American Civil War, the North won in large part because its blockade of Southern ports prevented the Confederacy from exporting its cotton. In DATE, the fact that Great Britain and its allies were able to disrupt German trade more successfully than Germany could impede the flow of goods into and out of Great Britain bore importantly on the ultimate outcomes of both world wars. Patterns of trade are determined by variations in a number of factors, including climate, the location of natural resources, and the skills and knowledge of the population. I suppose that one could grow roses commercially here in Montana for Valentine's Day, but it would likely require climate-controlled greenhouses complete with artificial lighting - very expensive. A much less costly solution is for Montanans to grow and sell wheat, then use the proceeds to buy roses from localities where the weather is balmy in DATE. This is all standard textbook material, and it may well leave you unconvinced of the importance of international trade. After all, the United States is a big country, and we can certainly achieve many of the benefits of specialization by trading within our own borders. How important is it for the health of our economy to trade actively with other countries? As best we can measure, it is critically important. According to one recent study that used four approaches to measuring the gains from trade, the increase in trade since World War II has boosted U.S. DATE incomes on the order of $NUM,NUM per household (Bradford, Grieco, and Hufbauer, DATE The same study found that removing all remaining barriers to trade would raise U.S. incomes anywhere from $NUM,NUM to $NUM,NUM per household. Other research has found similar results. Our willingness to trade freely with the world is indeed an essential source of our prosperity - and I think it is safe to say that the importance of trade for us will continue to grow. In practice, the benefits of trade flow from a number of sources. By giving domestic firms access to new markets, trade promotes efficient specialization, permits economies of scale, and increases the potential returns to innovation.NUM U.S. firms increasingly seek to expand production and profits through new export opportunities; indeed, U.S. exports grew about NUM percent in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) terms DATE. Export-oriented U.S. manufacturing industries include producers of aircraft, construction equipment, plastics, and chemicals. The United States also excels in the manufacture and export of sophisticated capital goods and scientific equipment. Outside of manufacturing, a number of U.S. high-tech companies, including software developers and online service providers, are world leaders in their fields. American films and music attract large worldwide audiences. Montana's exports include wheat, metal ores, and high-tech materials that are critical to the production of semiconductors. Firms that emphasize exports are among America's most dynamic and productive companies. Relative to firms that produce strictly for the domestic market, exporters tend to be more technologically sophisticated and to create better jobs. Among U.S. manufacturers, for example, exporters pay higher wages and add jobs more rapidly than non-exporters (Bernard and Jensen, DATE). A significant portion of U.S. international trade is conducted by multinational firms; studies show that these firms generally pay higher wages than purely domestic firms, both in the United States and in developing countries (Doms and Jensen, DATE; Bhagwati, DATE, p. NUM). U.S. firms with a global reach tend to be better diversified and are better able to respond to new market opportunities wherever they may arise. Exports are important, but so are imports. Without trade, some goods would be extremely expensive or not available at all, such as the Valentine's Day roses of my earlier example or out-of-season fruits and vegetables. Trade also makes goods available in more brands and varieties; examples include automobiles, consumer electronics, garments and footwear, wines, and cheeses. One of the great attractions of globalization is that it brings to consumers the best of many cultures. And of course, global trade allows many types of goods, especially consumer goods, to be purchased at lower prices. Lower prices help all consumers but may be especially helpful to those with tight budgets. Indeed, a number of the large, import-intensive retail chains in the United States are focused on low- and moderate-income consumers, who benefit from being able to buy a wide variety of lower-priced goods. Another substantial benefit of trade is the effect it tends to have on the productivity of domestic firms and on the quality of their output.NUM By creating a global market, trade enhances competition, which weeds out the most inefficient firms and induces others to improve their products and to produce more efficiently. The U.S. manufacturing sector, which is perhaps the sector most exposed to international competition, has achieved truly remarkable increases in its productivity in DATE or so. In addition, international supply chains, made possible by advances in communication and transportation, reduce costs and increase the competitiveness of U.S. firms. Trade also promotes the transfer of technologies, as when multinational firms or transplanted firms bring advanced production methods to new markets. Trade and finance are closely linked and mutually supporting, and in DATE international financial flows have grown even more quickly than trade volumes. The globalization of finance plays to the strengths of U.S. financial institutions and financial markets. The United States has a large surplus in trade in financial services, and U.S. firms are leaders in providing banking, investment, and insurance services to the world. Financial openness allows U.S. investors to find new opportunities abroad and makes it possible for foreigners to invest in the United States. The ability to invest globally also permits greater diversification and sharing of risk. Trade benefits advanced countries like the United States, but open trade is, if anything, even more important for developing nations. Trade and globalization are lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, especially in Asia, but also in parts of Africa and Latin America (Bhagwati, DATE). As a source of economic growth and development in poor countries, trade is proving far more effective than traditional development aid (DATE). The transition economies of central and eastern Europe have also benefited greatly from trade, especially trade with the rest of the European Union. A recent study by the World Bank compared two groups of developing countries, dubbed the \"globalizers\" and the \"nonglobalizers.\" Collectively, the globalizers have doubled the ratio of trade to their gross domestic product (GDP) over DATE, in part because of sharp cuts in tariffs on imports; the nonglobalizers, collectively, have seen a decline in their trade-to-GDP ratio over DATE (Dollar and Kraay, DATE). Among the globalizers, economic growth accelerated from NUM percent per year in DATE, to NUM percent in DATE, to NUM percent in DATE. In contrast, the nonglobalizers have seen their growth decline from NUM percent per year in DATE to NUM percent in DATE and NUM percent in DATE. The study also found that, among the globalizers, absolute poverty declined significantly and the degree of income inequality changed little.NUM If trade is so beneficial, why do we sometimes see political resistance to freer, more open trade? Notably, negotiations in the so-called Doha Round of trade talks now under way have proceeded very slowly, notwithstanding a consensus among economists that all countries involved would enjoy substantial benefits from further trade liberalization. One important reason is that, although trade increases overall prosperity, the benefits for some people may not exceed the costs, at least not in the short run. Clearly, the expansion of trade helps exporting firms and their workers. As consumers, nearly all of us benefit from trade by gaining access to a broader range of goods and services. But some of us, such as workers in industries facing new competition from imports, are made at least temporarily worse off when trade expands. Because the benefits of trade are widely diffused and often indirect, those who lose from trade are often easier to identify than those who gain, a visibility that may influence public perceptions and the political process. That said, the job losses and worker displacement sometimes associated with expanded trade are a legitimate economic and social issue. In the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on the impact of trade on U.S. jobs - both positive and negative - and discuss some possible policy responses. Trade and jobs Does opening U.S. markets to foreign producers destroy jobs at home? The expansion of trade or changes in trading patterns can indeed destroy specific jobs. For example, foreign competition has been an important factor behind declining employment in the U.S. textile industry, including in my home state of South Carolina. Job loss - from any cause - can create hardship for individuals, their families, and their communities. I will return shortly to the question of how we should respond to the problem of worker displacement. For now, however, I will point out that trade also creates jobs - for example, by expanding the potential market overseas for goods and services produced in the United States, as I have already discussed. Trade creates jobs indirectly as well, in support of export activities or as the result of increased economic activity associated with trade. For example, gains in disposable income created by lower consumer prices and higher earnings in export industries raise the demand for domestically produced goods and services. Domestic production and employment are also supported by expanded access to raw materials and intermediate goods. The U.S. jobs created by trade also tend to offer higher pay and demand greater skill than the jobs that are destroyed - although a downside is that, in the short run, the greater return to skills created by trade may tend to increase the wage differential between higher-skilled and lower-skilled workers and thus contribute to income inequality (Bernanke, DATE). The effects of trade on employment must also be put in the context of the remarkable dynamism of the U.S. labor market. The amount of \"churn\" in the labor market - the number of jobs created and destroyed - is enormous and reflects the continuous entry, exit, and resizing of firms in our everchanging economy. Excluding job layoffs and losses reversed within DATE, over DATE an average of nearly NUM million private-sector jobs have been eliminated DATE in the United States, an DATE loss equal to nearly NUM percent of the current level of nonfarm private employment.NUM The vast majority of these job losses occur for a principal reason other than international trade (Kletzer, DATE; Bernanke, DATE). Moreover, during DATE, the NUM million DATE job losses have been more than offset by the creation of about NUM million jobs per year - some of which, of course, are attributable to the direct and indirect effects of trade. Truly, the U.S. labor market exhibits a phenomenal capacity for creative destruction. If trade both destroys and creates jobs, what is its overall effect on employment? The answer is, essentially none. In the long run, the workings of a competitive labor market ensure that the number of jobs created will be commensurate with the size of the labor force and with the mix of skills that workers bring. Thus, in the long run, factors such as population growth, labor force participation rates, education and training, and labor market institutions determine the level and composition of aggregate employment. To see the irrelevance of trade to total employment, we need only observe that, DATE, the share of imports in the U.S. economy nearly quadrupled, from NUM percent of GDP to NUM percent. Yet, reflecting growth in the labor force, employment more than doubled during that time, and the unemployment rate was at about NUM-NUM/NUM percent at both the beginning and end of the period. Furthermore, average real compensation per hour in the United States has nearly doubled since DATE. Although many readily accept that balanced trade does not reduce aggregate employment, some might argue that the United States' current large trade deficit must mean that the number of U.S. jobs has been reduced on net. However, the existence of a trade deficit or surplus, by itself, does not have any evident effect on the level of employment. For example, across countries, trade deficits and unemployment rates show little correlation. Among our six Group of Seven partners (the world's leading industrial countries), three have trade surpluses (Canada, Germany, and Japan). However, based on the figures for DATE of DATE, the unemployment rates in Canada (NUM percent) and in Germany (NUM percent) are significantly higher than the NUM percent rate in the United States; and Japan's unemployment rate, at NUM percent, is only a bit lower.NUM Factors such as the degree of flexibility in the labor market, not trade, are the primary source of these cross-country variations in unemployment. What about outsourcing abroad? The debate about the effects of trade on employment has been intensified by the phenomenon of outsourcing abroad, or \"offshoring.\" Offshoring has been driven by several factors, including improvements in international communication, the computerization and digitization of some business services, and the existence of educated, often English-speaking workers abroad who will perform the same services for less pay. A portion, though not all, of these wage differentials reflects differences in skills and productivity; for example, outsourced programming work is usually simpler and more routine than programming done in the United States. The increase in outsourcing abroad has led to dire predictions about a wholesale \"export\" of U.S. jobs in DATE. Although globalization and trade will continue to be forces for economic change, concerns about a massive loss of jobs due to offshoring do not seem justified. Companies have found outsourcing abroad profitable primarily for jobs that can be routinized and sharply defined. Certainly, advancing technology will continue to increase the feasibility of providing services from remote locations. For the foreseeable future, however, most high-value work will require creative interaction among employees, interaction which is facilitated by physical proximity and personal contact. Moreover, in many fields, closeness to customers and knowledge of local conditions are also of great importance. These observations suggest that, for some considerable time, outsourcing abroad will be uneconomical for many types of jobs, particularly high-value jobs.NUM Moreover, a balanced discussion of outsourcing abroad should reflect that, just as U.S. firms use the services of foreigners, foreign firms make considerable use of the services of U.S. residents. Many do not realize that, in contrast to its trade deficit in goods, the United States runs a significant trade surplus in services - particularly in business, professional, and technical services. This country provides many high-value services to users abroad, including financial, legal, engineering, architectural, and software development services, whereas many of the services imported by U.S. companies are less sophisticated and hence of lower value.NUM A recent study of twenty-one occupations that are most likely to be affected by outsourcing found that net job losses were concentrated almost exclusively in the lower-wage occupations and that strong employment gains have occurred in the occupations that pay the highest wages.NUM Further expansion of trade in services will help, not hurt, the U.S. economy and the labor market. Just as discussions of the outsourcing of business services tend to ignore the services U.S. firms sell to other countries, so do discussions of the movement of jobs offshore ignore the fact that foreign firms also move jobs to the United States. Between DATE and DATE (the most recent data available), the employment of U.S. residents by majority-owned nonbank affiliates of foreign companies operating within the United States increased by about NUM million jobs. In DATE, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies accounted for more than $NUM billion in value added (about half in manufacturing) and about $NUM billion in exports. Globalization and offshoring work both ways. Responding to job displacement Although trade has many positive effects in the labor market, nothing I have said TIME is intended to minimize the real costs imposed on workers and communities when new competition from abroad leads to job losses and displacement. What can be done to help workers who lose their jobs as a consequence of expanded trade? Restricting trade by imposing tariffs, quotas, or other barriers is exactly the wrong thing to do. Such solutions might temporarily slow job loss in affected industries, but the benefits would be outweighed, typically many times over, by the costs, which would include higher prices for consumers and increased costs (and thus reduced competitiveness) for U.S. firms. Indeed, studies of the effects of protectionist policies almost invariably find that the costs to the rest of society far exceed the benefits to the protected industry. In the long run, economic isolationism and retreat from international competition would inexorably lead to lower productivity for U.S. firms and lower living standards for U.S. consumers (Bernanke, DATE). The better approach to mitigating the disruptive effects of trade is to adopt policies and programs aimed at easing the transition of displaced workers into new jobs and increasing the adaptability and skills of the labor force more generally. Many suggestions for such policies have been made. Currently, the government's principal program for helping workers displaced by trade is the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which is up for renewal before the Congress DATE. As now structured, the program offers up to two and a half years of job training, allowances for job search and relocation, income support for eligible workers, and health insurance assistance for some. Elements of other proposals being discussed (Kletzer and Rosen, DATE; Kling, DATE; Mann DATE, DATE) include job-training tax credits and wage insurance, which would help offset pay cuts that often occur when displaced workers change jobs. Another approach is to focus on establishing policies that reduce the cost to workers of changing jobs, for example, by increasing the portability of pensions or health insurance between employers. As new technologies expand the range of occupations that may be subject to international competition, measures to assist affected workers become all the more important. It would not be appropriate for me to endorse specific programs; that is the prerogative of the Congress. However, I can safely predict that these and other policy proposals to address concerns about worker displacement will be the subject of active debate in DATE. More generally, investing in education and training would help young people entering the labor force as well as those already in mid-career to better manage the ever-changing demands of the workforce (Bernanke, DATE). A substantial body of research demonstrates that investments in education and training pay high rates of return to individuals and to society as a whole (Acemogulu and Angrist, DATE; Becker, DATE; Card, DATE; Topel, DATE). Importantly, workforce skills can be improved not only through K-NUM education, college, and graduate work but also through a variety of expeditious, marketbased channels such as on-the-job training, coursework at community colleges and vocational schools, extension courses, and online training. An eclectic, market-responsive approach to increasing workforce skills is the most likely to be successful. Whatever the specific approaches chosen, helping workers who have lost jobs - whether because of trade or other causes - to find new productive work is good for the economy as well as for the affected workers and their families. Moreover, if workers and their families are less fearful of change, political pressure in favor of trade barriers or other measures that would reduce the flexibility and dynamism of the U.S. economy would be reduced (Kull, DATE). Conclusion To sum up, international trade in goods, services, and assets, like other forms of market-based exchange, allows us to transform what we have into what we need or want under increasingly beneficial terms. Trade allows us to enjoy both a more productive economy and higher living standards. Of course, current trading arrangements are far from perfect. Some features of the world trading regime, such as excessive restrictions on trade in services and the uneven protection of intellectual property rights, are both unfair and economically counterproductive. Working through the World Trade Organization or in other venues, we should continue to advocate the elimination of trade distortions and barriers in our trading partners even as we increase the openness of our own economy. We should also work to ensure that both we and our trading partners live up to existing agreements under the World Trade Organization. When trading partners do not meet their obligations, we should vigorously press our case. Ultimately, a freer and more open trading system is in everyone's best interest. Although expansion of trade makes the U.S. economy stronger, as I have noted DATE, the broad benefits of trade and the associated economic change may come at a cost to some individuals, firms, and communities. We need to continue to find ways to minimize the pain of dislocation without standing in the way of economic growth and change. Indeed, the willingness to embrace difficult challenges is a defining characteristic of the American people. With our strong institutions, deep capital markets, flexible labor markets, technological leadership, and penchant for entrepreneurship and innovation, no country is better placed than the United States to benefit from increased participation in the global economy. If we resist protectionism and isolationism while working to increase the skills and adaptability of our labor force, the forces of globalization and trade will continue to make our economy stronger and our citizens more prosperous.

David Dodge: Bank of Canada's views on the Canadain economy and its monetary policy objective Opening statement by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, Ottawa, NUM May DATE. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. We appreciate the opportunity to meet with your committee, which we usually do twice a year, following the release of our Monetary Policy Report. We believe that these meetings help us to keep Members of Parliament and, through you, all Canadians, informed of the Bank's views on the economy and about the objective of monetary policy and the actions we take to achieve it. When Paul and I appeared before the Finance Committee DATE, we noted then that the outlook for growth in the Canadian economy had been revised down slightly from earlier expectations. In our latest Monetary Policy Report, which we released DATE, we noted that Canada's economic growth did indeed slow, but recently, inflation has been higher than expected. After considering the full range of indicators, the Bank now judges that the Canadian economy was operating just above its production capacity in the first quarter of DATE. We expect that, over the projection horizon, domestic demand will continue to be the main driver of growth in Canada. With the U.S. slowdown now expected to be somewhat more prolonged than previously projected, net exports should exert",

                  "Alan Greenspan: China Testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Finance, US Senate, Washington DC, DATE.    Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here DATE to offer my views on China's trade and exchange rate regime. I would emphasize that the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board. Some observers mistakenly believe that a marked increase in the exchange value of the Chinese renminbi (RMB) relative to the U.S. dollar would significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States. I am aware of no credible evidence that supports such a conclusion. The enhanced integration of China into the world trading system is having a notable effect on Asia's trade with the rest of the world and on trade within Asia. After having risen rapidly through DATE, U.S. imports from Asia excluding China have flattened since DATE. This has occurred as production within Asia has evolved, with the final stages of assembly and exporting to the United States and elsewhere becoming increasingly concentrated in China. As a consequence, because exports by country are recorded on a gross basis rather than as value added, the widening of the United States' bilateral trade deficit with China, measured gross, has largely been in lieu of wider deficits with other Asian economies, including Japan. Measured by value added, our bilateral deficits with China would have been far less, and our bilateral deficits with other Asian exporters would have been far more. Accordingly, an increase in the exchange rate of the RMB, relative to the dollar, would likely redirect trade within Asia, reversing to some extent the patterns that have emerged during DATE. However, a revaluation of the RMB would have limited consequences for overall U.S. imports as well as for U.S. exports that compete with Chinese products in third markets. Such a revaluation would affect Chinese value added but not the dollar cost of intermediate goods imported into China from the rest of Asia, which represents a significant share of the gross value of Chinese exports to the United States and elsewhere. (To the extent that exporters to China revalued as well, of course, the impact on overall Asian exports would be somewhat greater.) The broad tariff on Chinese goods that has recently been proposed, should it be implemented, would significantly lower U.S. imports from China but would comparably raise U.S. imports from other low-cost sources of supply. At only slightly higher prices than prevail at present, U.S. imports of textiles, light manufactures, assembled computers, toys, and similar products would in part shift from China as the final assembler to other emerging-market economies in Asia and, perhaps, in Latin America as well. Few, if any, American jobs would be protected. More generally, any significant elevation of tariffs that substantially reduces our overall imports, by keeping out competitively priced goods, would materially lower our standard of living. A return to protectionism would threaten the continuation of much of the extraordinary growth in living standards worldwide, but especially in the United States, that is due importantly to the post-World War II opening of global markets. Such an initiative would send the adverse message to our trading partners that the United States, while accepting the benefits of broadened world trade, is not willing to absorb the structural adjustments that are often necessary. To maintain a rising standard of living, a dynamic economy such as ours requires a continual shifting of resources toward the most up-to-date technologies, financed not only by savings but also importantly by the depreciation of increasingly obsolescent facilities. This highly dynamic process is mirrored in our labor markets, where jobs are constantly being created and destroyed at a rapid pace. New hires in the United States currently average more than a million per week, half resulting from voluntary job change. At the same time, during a typical DATE, about NUM,NUM workers are temporarily laid off and another NUM,NUM are subject to permanent job loss. Any effect of trade with China on U.S. employment is likely to be very small relative to the scale of job creation and job loss in our economy. A policy to dismantle the global trading system in a misguided effort to protect jobs from competition would redound to the eventual detriment of all U.S. job seekers, as well as of millions of American consumers. Policy should aim to bolster the well-being of job losers through retraining and unemployment insurance, not to stave off job loss through counterproductive efforts to impede the process of income-enhancing international trade and globalization.  While the presumption that a revaluation of the RMB will notably increase jobs in the United States by constraining imports or expanding exports is without statistical or analytical support, it is nonetheless the case that a more flexible RMB would be helpful to China's economic stability and, hence, to world and U.S. economic growth. Rapid accumulation of foreign, largely dollar, reserve holdings by the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, as a consequence of support for the RMB could boost the growth of the money stock, with the accompanying risk of triggering upward pressure on inflation and a general overheating of the Chinese economy. The Chinese central bank's issuance of liquidity management bonds to lessen potential increases in the money supply created by foreign asset accumulation has accelerated since regular issuance began in DATE. Nonetheless, only about one-half of the increase in reserves over DATE has been offset, with the remainder showing through as money growth. Because the Chinese financial system has considerable distance to go before achieving a satisfactory degree of soundness and flexibility, sterilization of continuing inflows of speculative funds will presumably become more difficult as the scale of these operations, already large, increases over time. In spite of its recent improvements, the financial system of China is still inordinately governed by administrative command and control. Market pricing of financial instruments is still accorded only a minor role. Financial markets, if left free to continuously reprice interest rates and asset values, will identify and respond to imbalances far sooner than a system based on administrative edict. In market-based financial pricing systems, automatic adjustments are inherent. But in a highly administered system, supervisors can identify emerging imbalances only when these imbalances become visibly large and are already troublesome. Adjustment in a system requiring human intervention is accordingly far less flexible than in a system based on the automaticity of markets. Given this vulnerability to emerging imbalances, the buildup of ever-larger holdings of bonds resulting from sterilization of foreign exchange purchases poses threats to China's financial stability. Hence, the sooner the Chinese, in their own self-interest, move to a more flexible currency regime, perhaps leading other Asian currencies to become more flexible as well, the better for all participants in the global trading system.  In DATE, it is in our interest and that of the global economy that China continue to progress toward becoming a more market-based, productive, and dynamic economy in which individual initiative, not government decisionmaking, is the fundamental strength behind economic activity. For our part, it is essential that we not put that outcome, or our future, at risk with a step back into protectionism.",

                  "Alan Greenspan: Current account Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Advancing Enterprise NUM Conference, London, England, DATE.    International trade has been expanding as a share of world gross domestic product since DATE World War II. Yet through DATE, the expansion was essentially a balanced grossing up of cross-border flows. Only in DATE has expanding trade been associated with the emergence of ever-larger U.S. current account deficits, lesser deficits elsewhere, matched by a corresponding widening of external surpluses in a majority of trading nations. The increased dispersion of these external imbalances is mirrored in a decline in the tight association between national saving rates and domestic investment rates. The correlation between the two, for countries representing four-fifths of world GDP, declined from a coefficient of around NUM in DATE, where it had hovered for DATE, to an estimated low of NUM last year.NUM A number of factors have recently converged to lessen restraints on cross-border financial flows as well as on trade in goods and services. The advance of information and communication technology has effectively shrunk the time and distance that separate markets around the world. The vast improvements in these newer technologies have broadened investors' vision to the point that foreign investment appears less exotic and risky. Combined with improvements in transportation networks, these developments have expanded the range of tradable goods and services that can be brought to each market and have enabled greater integration of the productive resources of national economies. Both deregulation and technological innovation have driven the globalization process by tearing down the barriers that have separated economic agents, thus lowering costs. The effect of these developments has been to markedly increase the willingness and ability of financial market participants to reach beyond national borders to invest in foreign countries, DATE and more ago savings moved beyond local investment opportunities to develop national markets. Implicit in the movement of savings across national borders to fund investment has been the significant increase in the dispersion of national current account balances. In DATE, the negative tail of the distribution of current account balances has been, of course, dominated by the U.S. deficit. The decline in home bias, as economists call the parochial tendency to invest domestic savings at home, has clearly enlarged the capacity of the United States to fund deficits. Arguably, however, it has been economic characteristics special to the United States that have permitted our current account deficit to be driven ever higher, in an environment of greater international capital mobility. In particular, the dramatic increase in underlying growth of U.S. productivity over DATE lifted real rates of return on dollar investments. These higher rates, in turn, appeared to be the principal cause of the notable rise in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar in DATE. As the dollar rose, gross operating profit margins of exporters to the United States increased even as trade and current account deficits in the United States widened markedly.NUM But these deficits have continued to grow over DATE despite a decline in the dollar, whose broadly weighted real index is now much of the way back to its previous low in DATE. Although the dollar's exchange rate has been declining since DATE, increasingly tight competitive conditions in the United States, as elsewhere, in DATE and DATE apparently induced exporters to the United States to hold dollar prices to competitive levels to ensure their market share and foothold in the world's largest economy. For example, from DATE to DATE, the dollar's exchange rate against the euro and sterling, on average, declined about NUM percent, yet dollar prices of imported manufactured goods from the European Union rose by only NUM percent, slightly more than dollar prices of U.S. manufactured goods during DATE. The consequence of the relatively small rise in the dollar price was a significant compression of gross operating profit margins on European exports to the United States. In DATE, exporters, not only in Europe but in many other trading partners of the United States as well, have tended to increasingly absorb declines in prices denominated in their own currencies when their currencies rose and to fatten profit margins when their currencies fell. Unit labor costs in euros and sterling, for example, increased nearly NUM percent between the first quarter of DATE and DATE. So, given the average fall in euro and sterling prices of European exports to the United States, gross operating profit margins on those sales must have declined more than NUM percentage points.NUM The margin squeeze, in effect, absorbed about three-quarters of the decline in the dollar's exchange rate relative to the euro and the pound, on average, over DATE. Export margins, as I indicated earlier, had apparently risen to high levels by DATE, following the roughly NUM percent increase in the value of the dollar in terms of euro and sterling from DATE to DATE. Hence, margins in DATE might still have exceeded their levels of DATE. However, with the strengthening of sterling and the euro that resumed in DATE, exporters to the United States exhibited significant resistance to further lowering of euro and sterling prices. Accordingly, dollar prices of imports from Europe picked up a bit. This pickup suggests that profit margins were minimal at best DATE and hence that exporters were willing to lose some U.S. market share rather than compress margins still further. A noticeable downtrend in the share of European exports in U.S. imports has been apparent over DATE.  Gains from increased currency hedging against the dollar since DATE4 may have enabled European exporters to tolerate a fall in operating profit margins beyond what they otherwise would have been able to tolerate. Hedging, however, can only partially and temporarily alter the impact of exchange rates on export prices. To be sure, very long-dated contracts can transcend short-run fluctuations in currencies. But, long-term hedging is expensive, and therefore, most currency futures contracts are short-term. Once hedges expire, export revenues are no longer protected from past and future changes in exchange rates, and any new hedges must reflect the new exchange rates. Thus, successful currency hedges can at best delay but cannot prevent the ultimate effects of changes in exchange rates on trade. Many other exporters to the United States have exhibited pricing strategies similar to those of European firms. Chinese exporters, of course, have not had to address this issue because China continues to hold its renminbi at a fixed rate against the dollar. U.S. exporters have also faced large exchange rate movements relative to many of their destination markets. The ratio of U.S. merchandise export prices to manufacturing unit labor costs provides some evidence of margin movements linked to exchange rates that is analogous to the effects I described earlier for foreign exporters. Given the dollar's depreciation since DATE, U.S. exporters' profit margins appear to be increasing, which bodes well for future U.S. exports and the adjustment process.  A consequence of the contraction in profit margins of exporters to the United States, and thus low pass-through of dollar depreciation to U.S. import prices, has been minimal pressure on U.S. consumer price inflation in DATE. A corollary is that the adjustment of U.S. real imports - that is, the quantity of imported goods and services - has been negligible. However, we may be approaching a point, if we are not already there, at which exporters to the United States, should the dollar decline further, would no longer choose to absorb a further reduction in profit margins. Although the limited response, to date, of import prices to the dollar's decline has likely forestalled a decline in U.S. real imports, the effect of the low pass-through of exchange rates into import prices on the nominal dollar value of imports, and thus on the trade balance, is more complex. Increases in import prices lower the quantity of imports but leave the resulting value of imports uncertain.  To understand why the nominal trade deficit - the nominal dollar value of imports minus exports - has widened considerably since DATE, even as the dollar has declined, we must consider several additional factors. First, partly as a legacy of the dollar's previous strength, the level of imports exceeds that of exports by about NUM percent. Thus exports must grow half again as quickly as imports just to keep the trade deficit from widening - a benchmark that has yet to be met. Second, as is well-documented, the responsiveness of U.S. imports to U.S. income exceeds the responsiveness of U.S. exports to foreign income; this difference leads to a tendency - even if the United States and foreign economies are growing at about the same rate - for the growth of U.S. imports to exceed that of our exports. Third, as of late, the growth of the U.S. economy has exceeded that of our trading partners, further reinforcing the factors leading imports to outstrip exports. Finally, our import bill has expanded significantly as oil prices have risen in DATE. To be sure, the lower dollar has undoubtedly boosted the competitiveness of U.S. exports and the profitability of U.S. exporters. These factors help explain the considerable increase in exports over DATE. Yet the positive effect of the dollar's decline on exports and on the trade balance has been offset by the other aforementioned factors.  Besides market pressures, which appear poised to stabilize and over the longer run possibly to decrease the U.S. current account deficit and its attendant financing requirements, some forces in the domestic U.S. economy seem about to head in the same direction. The voice of fiscal restraint, barely audible DATE, has at least partially regained volume. If actions are taken to reduce federal government dissaving, pressures to borrow from abroad will presumably diminish.NUM An increase in household saving should also act to diminish borrowing from abroad. The growth of home mortgage debt has been the major contributor, at least in an accounting sense, to the decline in the personal saving rate in the United States from almost NUM percent in DATE to its current level of NUM percent. The fall in U.S. interest rates since DATE has supported both home price increases and, in DATE, an unprecedented rate of existing home turnover. This combination has led to a significant increase in home mortgage debt. The rise in home prices creates capital gains, which become realized with the subsequent sale of a home. The amount of debt paid off by the seller of an existing home averages about three-fifths of the mortgage debt taken on by the buyer, effectively converting to cash an amount of home equity close to the realized gain. This cash payout is financed by the net increase in debt on the purchased home, and hence on total mortgage debt outstanding. Even after accounting for the down payments on any subsequent home purchase, sellers receive, net, large amounts of cash, which they view as unencumbered. The counterpart of that cash, the increased debt taken on by the homebuyers, is supported by the new home values enhanced by capital gains. In addition, low mortgage interest rates have encouraged significant growth of home equity loan advances and cash-out refinancings, which are another channel for the extraction of previously unrealized capital gains on homes. All told, home mortgage debt, driven largely by equity extraction, has grown much more rapidly in DATE than during DATE. Surveys suggest that approximately half of equity extraction shows up in additional household expenditures, reducing savings commensurately and thereby presumably contributing to the current account deficit. Interestingly, the change in U.S. home mortgage debt over DATE correlates significantly with our current account deficit.NUM To be sure, correlation is not causation, and there have been many influences on both mortgage debt and the current account. Nevertheless, over DATE, major innovations in the United States have improved the availability and lowered the costs of home mortgages. These developments likely spurred homeowners to tap increasing home equity to finance consumer expenditures beyond home purchase. In contrast, mortgage debt is not so readily available among our trading partners as a vehicle to finance consumption expenditures.  Because exporters to the United States are willing to countenance wide swings in profit margins, the level of international trade may be less variable than under previous price-setting regimes when exchange rate pass-through was greater. Arguably, this development has contributed to a higher level of trade. Accordingly, the competitive benefits of globalization may be greater than if exporters allowed exports rather than profit margins to swing widely with exchange rate changes, as they apparently did earlier in the post-World War II period. Exports, of course, were a much smaller share of world GDP in DATE. And many, perhaps most, producers, as exchange rates moved in their favor, accordingly chose to pick off only the low-hanging trade fruit, so to speak. Such opportunistic exports obviated large up-front financial commitments to foreign markets. As trade barriers have been lowered over DATE, much has changed, evidenced by the emergence of critical mass in many export markets, the growing importance of multinational firms, and the rise of production processes that are integrated across borders.  The interaction of a wide range of economic forces, which adjust at national borders to create what we call the current account balance, has proved difficult to predict with any precision, primarily because of the difficulty of forecasting exchange rates. These same forces have lessened our ability to anticipate the consequences of a buildup of either a surplus or a deficit. In addition, numerous issues that have arisen with respect to the adjustment of the U.S. current account remain unresolved. One is the effect of Asian official purchases of dollars in support of their currencies. Such intervention may be supporting the dollar and U.S. Treasury bond prices somewhat, but the effect is difficult to pin down. Another issue is the influence of still-growing globalization, arguably one of the key factors that has facilitated the financing of the U.S. current account deficit. There is little evidence that the growth of globalization has yet slowed. The dramatic advances over DATE in virtually all measures of globalization have resulted in an international economic environment with little relevant historical precedent.NUM I have argued elsewhere that the U.S. current account deficit cannot widen forever but that, fortunately, the increased flexibility of the American economy will likely facilitate any adjustment without significant consequences to aggregate economic activity.NUM That argument will be tested, I suspect, by possibly new twists and turns that will emerge in a seemingly ever-more complex international economic and financial structure.",

                  "Timothy F Geithner: The Bretton Woods institutions in DATE Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, before the Bretton Woods Committee, New York, DATE.    It is a pleasure to join you for this meeting of the Bretton Woods Committee. This is a great and accomplished organization. Although the international financial institutions are one of the most important legacies of the great statesmen of DATE, the task of supporting them is not always easy. The Committee has been effective in this role, not just by helping to explain the accomplishments of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to an occasionally skeptical public, but also by helping to shape the debate on how these institutions need to change. The Fund, from its inception, was burdened by a mismatch between the aspirations of its architects and the authority and instruments they gave the institution to pursue those ambitions. Its authority over the policies of its members was limited. Its resources were small, and the facilities established to deploy those resources were modest relative to the problems they were designed to address. At its creation, the architects of the Fund hoped to build a system that would deliver exchange rate stability globally, in a world much less integrated than it is DATE, without giving the Fund the capacity to induce, much less compel, its members to pursue the economic policies that might have made that objective more realistic. They gave the IMF a financial mission that had some of the characteristics of a lender of last resort to sovereigns, but without mechanisms to constrain risk-taking behavior. By necessity, they left the Fund in the position where it was ultimately dependent on the strength of the governments of its members, and on their willingness to act to address their economic challenges. To their credit, the founders gave the institution a basic charter that permitted evolution. And as the needs of the world have changed, the institution has been able to change as well. It has been much more responsive to change, and much more agile in responding to a rapidly changing mix of challenges than other multilateral organizations. But the constraints that were established at the outset still exist DATE. I am going to focus, in my remarks DATE, on the Fund's role in promoting financial resilience and mitigating crises in emerging market countries. But first, let me mention briefly several of the other areas where the Fund has a very important role to play in the international economy and financial system. The Fund can provide a useful voice and a forum for advising the major economies to pursue policies that can contribute better to global economic expansion and financial stability. The Fund can play an important role in considering, from a global or systemic perspective, the exchange rate policies of its members. And the Fund plays a vital role in providing the macroeconomic policy framework that is the critical to sustaining better growth outcomes and the effectiveness of the global development assistance effort for the poorest, low-income countries. I think the Fund is reasonably close to the frontier, the sensible or achievable frontier, in these areas. Some may wish it were more effective in persuading the G-NUM to avoid policies that create the risk of abrupt changes in financial market conditions or exchange rates, but it will never be decisive in this arena. And it might do more to further improve the design of macroeconomic policies and institutions in the poorest developing countries. But outside those areas, the challenges to sustained growth in per capita income lie largely in areas beyond the core competence of the IMF. In the emerging market context, in contrast, there is greater distance between the Fund of DATE and the achievable frontier. This is a timely and critical issue, because of the magnitude of the challenges that still confront many emerging market economies. Let me start with a broad review of the progress made over DATE across emerging markets in reducing their vulnerability to financial crisis.  International reserves have increased substantially, providing a larger cushion against adversity. Among the largest borrowers, half now hold reserves greater than NUM percent of maturing short- and long-term debt; less than one-sixth had such coverage heading into DATE.  There have been improvements in fiscal performance, with some notable cases of governments achieving and sustaining large primary surpluses.  External balances have improved, with current accounts in most of the emerging world in surplus or modest deficit. Only NUM of the NUM largest borrowers now are running deficits in excess of NUM percent.  Exchange rate regimes are more resilient and less fragile, as a substantial majority of the largest borrowing countries have moved to flexible regimes, and away from the fixed-butadjustable pegs that proved so dangerous in the crises of DATE.  Important progress has been made in building credibility for new monetary policy regimes, and inflation is generally moderate.  Governments have made major investments in recapitalizing and restructuring their troubled financial systems. For example, in Asia, where some of the most severe problems were encountered, governments have spent over $NUM billion carving out problem loans and bolstering capital.  Growth rates have improved with the restoration of domestic stability and recovery in external demand. Indeed, aggregate growth currently is running at its highest rate since the onset of the crisis in DATE.  With these improvements, and generally accommodative external financial conditions, borrowing costs have fallen, capital market access was restored for many countries, and credit growth resumed. Net credit growth to sovereigns has remained moderate, however, as much of the borrowing has gone to refinancing the existing stock of debt on more favorable terms.  The market for emerging market debt also has matured. There has been more differentiation in the response of spreads, both on the way down as credit fundamentals seemed to improve, and during the recent correction. This progress is indicative of a general increase in the sophistication and skill of economic policy makers in the emerging world, and in the quality of understanding of the benefits of macroeconomic stability and how to achieve it. Many countries benefited from the advice and financial support from the IMF and the multilateral development banks. But the most successful were those with policy makers who were ahead of the Fund and the Bank in diagnosing and addressing their problems, rather than being dragged reluctantly toward a more credible policy stance. These improvements have left the emerging markets as a group less vulnerable to financial crisis than they were in DATE. The combination of deeper reserve cushions, stronger external positions, improved balance sheets, more flexible exchange rate regimes, and better inflation performance provide a very different setting from what existed the last time we faced a transition after a sustained period of benign financial conditions and low interest rates. These aggregate improvements mask substantial differences across countries and a number of areas of lingering vulnerability. Let me highlight some, and then suggest some implications for how the Fund might better position itself to deal with the challenges they present.  Some of the most daunting challenges are in the fiscal and public debt area, where a number of emerging market economies across different regions face very high, and in some cases still growing public sector debt levels. Average public debt burdens in the emerging world have risen to about NUM percent of GDP, and among countries rated single B and below, the mean rises above NUM percent.  The challenge of managing debt burdens of this size is magnified by the fact that the debt structures in a number of countries are still quite vulnerable to foreign currency, liquidity, and interest rate risk. The substantial share of public debt denominated in foreign currency - NUM percent on average for the lowest rated group of borrowers - and the relatively short maturity of the debt stock mean that a relatively modest shock can produce a substantial increase in debt burdens, raising the amount of fiscal effort needed to keep the debt stock on a stable or declining path, and increasing the economy's vulnerability to a crisis.  In some countries, the fiscal trajectory is too weak to place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a sustainable path. In others, the fiscal position is strong enough to stabilize the debt dynamics, but provides little buffer against adverse shocks, and very little room for fiscal policy to help cushion the effects of such a shock.  Important challenges remain in the financial area as well. In many countries, large public sector debt burdens have left banking systems highly exposed to the sovereign, constraining authorities' room for maneuver. There are also problems in banks' corporate and consumer loan books, and a number of banking systems also have a large share of foreign currency denominated liabilities, in some cases held by non-residents.  The durability of recent improvements in external positions, which reflect weak domestic demand in many countries, is also open to question. As domestic demand strengthens, external balances could move into deficit again, which in some cases will reintroduce a greater external risk.  And in many cases, the financial exposure of the IMF and the multilateral development banks is already high. These balance sheet challenges took a long time to develop, and they will take a long time to reverse. They are the legacy of DATE decisions, magnified by the impact of crises on growth, the exchange rate, and the financial sector. They leave an exacting set of policy challenges. They raise the risk that future shocks to domestic confidence or adverse changes in the external environment could lead to new pressures on exchange rates, on interest rates, and on the capacity of countries to fund themselves on sustainable terms. Apart from the risk of crisis, these debt levels are large enough to depress domestic investment and long-term growth prospects. In part because of these balance sheet and debt burdens, many emerging market economies face a protracted transition before they can expect to be comfortably considered stable investment grade credits, with sufficient levels of self-insurance against external and domestic challenges to financial stability. One of the most pressing challenges for the Fund is to help assist in this process of reducing vulnerability, by promoting an unwinding of these large balance sheet risks and, at the same time, providing a credible form of contingent insurance for those hopefully rare circumstances when its members face extraordinary financing needs. The Fund would be better able to contribute to this process if it were to strengthen its policies in a number of specific areas. My suggestions cover four types of reforms: changes to the substantive focus of Fund policy advice; to the relationship between the Fund and its members in the surveillance framework; to the Fund's approach to countries undertaking a debt restructuring; and to how the Fund uses its financial resources. They involve adopting: a risk based approach for focusing the Fund's crisis prevention work; a more intensive framework for the surveillance process to provide a stronger anchor for the member's economic program; a reinforced framework for providing support to countries undertaking a debt restructuring; and a more credible form of financial insurance that creates better incentives for stronger policies in advance of crisis. These proposals do not require amending the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, and can be achieved without major changes in the structure of the institution. They are evolutionary rather than revolutionary. More policy ambition Studies by IMF staff, the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office, and others catalogue a number of criticisms of the substantive content of the Fund's policy advice. Many of these studies conclude that the Fund has had insufficient ambition in its prescriptions for reform and in a number of cases was too deferential to domestic political constraints on adjustment and reform. Some conclude it was too supportive of choices by its members to run exchange rate regimes that were incompatible with the rest of the policy framework, that led to substantial appreciation of the real effective exchange rate over time, that encouraged borrowing in foreign currency, and that proved too brittle under stress. Some suggest the Fund was in some cases insufficiently attentive to or ineffective in addressing the increases in debt, particularly foreign exchange denominated and linked debt, that created the balance sheet problems, which made crises so damaging and difficult to resolve. It accommodated, if not supported, decisions by its members to calibrate policies designed for a more benign external environment than was realistic and therefore encouraged less self-insurance than was necessary to manage safely. And it was drawn too far into a range of efficiency-improving long-term institutional reforms that necessarily diffused attention from critical vulnerabilities. To some extent, these criticisms suffer the classic failure of claiming that what seems obvious in hindsight was as clear at the time. Many are unfair in the degree of influence they expect the Fund to be able to exert over a reluctant member - recall the constraints I described at the beginning on the Fund's powers over its members. And many of the criticisms fail to recognize the difficulty of making definitive judgements about the path of policies consistent with sustainability. Yet elements of this general diagnosis of the Fund's policy advice to emerging market economies have substantial merit. If the Fund is going to contribute to a process of well-targeted reform, particularly in the more vulnerable countries, it probably needs to raise the bar, to increase the level of ambition of its policy recommendations. Greater policy focus is required on the principal sources of near-term vulnerability, ideally without fully eclipsing longer-term institution building and structural reforms important to raising growth potential. A risk-based framework for determining the hierarchy of policy priorities is important. Such a framework would almost certainly entail more focus on unwinding large balance sheet problems (both with respect to the sovereign and the financial system), reducing sovereign debt to more sustainable levels, making debt dynamics less vulnerable to shocks, increasing liquidity buffers, and preserving appropriate exchange rate arrangements. Addressing these issues would help reduce the risk of future capital account crises. It would create better conditions for private sector growth. In virtually every context where public sector debt burdens are high and fiscal deficits large, more ambition in the adjustment path should be positive for growth through the effect on confidence, interest rates, and the exchange rate. Of course the Fund can't want reform more than its members. The principal burden for running a set of policies more commensurate with the risks emerging markets face in this world rests with their governments. The role of the Fund should be to help guide and encourage them to the point where they build in a more substantial degree of self-insurance. The Fund should not acquiesce in and validate policy frameworks that fall substantially short of the threshold necessary to safely navigate this world of high variability in the external environment and occasional domestic political pressures to weaken policies. Changing the surveillance framework Part of the challenge entails reorienting surveillance, the process through which the Fund's policy advice is delivered, to make it more effective. The surveillance framework of DATE has a number of features that make it poorly suited to a small open emerging market economy that has fragile credibility, a limited buffer against shocks, and considerable exposure to a rapidly changing economic and financial environment. The assessments occur quite infrequently, only every NUM to NUM months. The assessments can only be published with the approval of the member state, which tends to take the edge off the diagnoses and prescriptions. Assessments do not come with a clear evaluation relative to thresholds that help define degrees of vulnerability, or relative to other countries in similar circumstances. The assessments are judgments of the Fund's Executive Board, not formally of the staff, which can also work to take the edge off candid economic and financial judgments. Risks are not clearly and candidly identified and explored. And the process does not come with consequences, since critical evaluation can be withheld from the public, and neither favorable nor critical evaluations necessarily have consequences for access to financial assistance from the Fund. The model we use for bank supervision in the United States offers an interesting contrast. We undertake a continuous process of onsite examination. We use a risk-based framework for focussing attention on critical factors. We produce a confidential rating of select dimensions of the financial profile of the institutions and their risk management and control infrastructure. We assess the models banks use to measure risk and the scenarios used to stress test exposures, but the banks have the responsibility for designing and running the risk management infrastructure. By looking across a broad range of world class financial institutions, we have a good sense of the evolving frontier of best practice in risk management which we can then use to help benchmark other institutions and pull common practice closer to that frontier. For a number of reasons, this can't be the model for the Fund's relationships with its members. But it provides an interesting prism in thinking about surveillance. The Fund has explored a number of ideas to strengthen the surveillance framework. One of the most promising is to establish a process with more frequent, published staff assessments of performance against a medium-term framework designed by the member country. That assessment could convey a clear judgement about the degree of progress being made in reducing vulnerabilities, improving resilience, and strengthening the structural underpinnings of growth. Analysis of public and external debt trends, benchmarked against sustainability and vulnerability thresholds, and stress tests for relevant shocks could play a key role in this process. There are compelling arguments for combining such a framework with contingent access to Fund resources. Surveillance DATE does not provide a meaningful check on ex ante policies, and resources are only made available when the financial need is acute. Access to supplemental resources from the Fund on a precautionary or contingent basis could make a critical difference in preventing short-term liquidity crises from becoming full-scale solvency problems leading to default. Of course, access to such contingent financing should be limited to countries whose policies were judged reasonably sustainable, and consistent with a reduction in balance sheet risks over time. With an enhanced surveillance framework designed to help keep policy on a stronger path that does reduce risk over time, and with contingent finance that could be mobilized quickly, the Fund would be better positioned to contain the risk of deeper financial crisis. And more of the policy reform that is a necessary accompaniment to Fund finance resources could be supported ex ante, rather than ex post. Catalyzing better policies sooner is the best defense, though it will never be a perfect defense, against crises. Facilitating restructurings We have seen some progress in DATE in efforts to improve the framework for sovereign restructurings. In particular, collective action clauses have now become the market standard where emerging market governments issue debt under foreign law. It will take some time for the full stock of sovereign emerging market debt to include these provisions for restructuring by majority action, but this progress is nonetheless important. But there are also some experiences that overshadow these more encouraging developments, and expose a breakdown in the broad consensus that had formed the basis for the successful past strategies of collaboration among the official sector, borrowers, and private creditors. Without commenting on the specifics of any particular case, let me offer a view of what I see as fundamental tenets of a credible approach by the international community to situations where a sovereign finds it necessary to restructure its obligations to private creditors: The IMF should be willing to lend to a sovereign that is in default to its private creditors only when two conditions have been established: First, the country must commit to a credible medium-term adjustment program, one that offers the prospect of a successful restructuring and a reasonably early return to the capital markets. This has to be established up front for any restructuring effort to work. Commitment to a credible adjustment path that offers the reasonable prospect of a return to financial viability and growth is the necessary foundation for engagement by the creditors in a restructuring process. Without that, there is little basis for meaningful engagement. The science of economics does not provide a definitive answer to what that adjustment path must be, but it does offer the means to determine a reasonable band of outcomes between the inadequate and the excessive. This judgment must be made by the government. It can be informed by consultations with the creditors. Ultimately, though, it has to be endorsed by the Fund, if the Fund is to lend. Second, before the Fund can commit its support, the country must develop, in consultation with its advisors, and outline to the Fund and its creditors, a credible and monitorable framework for cooperatively achieving a viable debt restructuring, one that leaves the country with a sustainable debt burden. The issues of appropriate adjustment and appropriate broad terms of proposed restructuring are closely intertwined and need to be assessed in tandem. For the Fund, it should be an essential prerequisite that the country demonstrate at the outset that its approach has credible prospects for enlisting broad creditor concurrence, and for being consistent with the country's macroeconomic framework and payment prospects. Reaffirming these conditions as the foundation for Fund support in restructuring or arrears cases would be a useful contribution to the system, and would leave the Fund better positioned to contribute to the favorable resolution of future crises that involve restructurings. Strengthening the Fund's financial instruments The Fund has taken a number of important steps to make its financial instruments more effective for dealing with the challenges inherent in a world with ever more integrated national financial systems. The reforms of late NUM's - the increase in the size of the Fund and its supplemental borrowing arrangements, the launch of new facilities that offered the means for large-scale lending at penalty rates in carefully circumscribed cases, the introduction of greater flexibility in the phasing of resources, and in how those resources could be used to reestablish confidence - were extremely important. More recently the Fund adopted a set of criteria designed to limit the risk that the Fund would make largescale resources available too frequently and in conditions where they would be unlikely to contribute to a resolution of the crisis. These various reforms gave the Fund a substantially more effective insurance mechanism for emerging market economies than it had before. Building on this progress, I see the key elements of a credible insurance mechanism as including the following:  Finance must be conditioned on a policy framework strong enough and timely enough to restore confidence. Fund resources can't compensate for a lack of policy credibility, and lending official resources to fund an inadequate policy effort may make the situation worse.  The scale of finance provided has to be calibrated to the need, and the needs can be substantial in DATE's world. The Fund can only fill part of the gap, but it has to be able to fill a credible share of the gap if it is to play a successful part in catalyzing other resources to flow.  Flexibility to structure programs appropriate to the circumstances and the borrower's policy efforts is essential. The Fund needs to be able to substantially front-load financial packages, when this is warranted. Making available small tranches of resources over the life of a program does little to address the realities of open emerging market economies facing liquidity problems. Rather than the classic staircase pattern of disbursements, the Fund should consider, in some cases, providing a larger up front tranche that floats and is available if stress materializes and policy is responding appropriately.  The Fund should stand ready to support countries in pursuing reasonable restructuring proposals when warranted by the circumstances. Official financial resources in that context can be helpful in meeting some targeted needs.  And finally, the Fund needs a more credible capacity to withstand arrears, so that it does not face the reality or the perception that is can be induced to accept weak programs only to allow it to refinance its exposure. Conclusion These are modest proposals. They only cover a small piece of the world of the Fund, much less the broader Bretton Woods institutions. They would not fundamentally change the balance established by the Fund's articles between the rights and obligations of its members. But they would help position the Fund to deal with future financial pressure in emerging markets. And given the scale of the economic costs imposed by recent crises, that is an important goal.

                  "Alan Greenspan: Economic flexibility Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the HM Treasury Enterprise Conference, London, England, (via satellite), DATE.    As the Great Depression of the DATE deepened, John Maynard Keynes offered an explanation for the then-bewildering series of events that was to engage economists for generations to come. Market systems, he argued, contrary to the conventional wisdom, did not at all times converge to full employment. They often, in economists' jargon, found equilibrium with significant segments of the workforce unable to find jobs. His insight rested largely on certain perceived rigidities in labor and product markets. The notion prevalent in DATE and earlier - that economies, when confronted with unanticipated shocks, would quickly return to full employment - fell into disrepute as the depression festered. In its place arose the view that government action was required to restore full employment. More broadly, government intervention was increasingly seen as necessary to correct the failures and deficiencies viewed as inherent in market economies. Laissez-faire was rapidly abandoned and a tidal wave of regulation swept over much of the world's business community. In the United States, labor practices, securities issuance, banking, agricultural pricing, and many other segments of the American economy, fell under the oversight of government. With the onset of World War II, both the U.S. and the U.K. economies went on a regimented war footing. Military production ramped up rapidly and output reached impressive levels. Central planning, in one sense, had its finest hour. The pattern of production and distribution depended on plans devised by a small, elite group rather than responding to the myriad choices of consumers that rule a market economy. The ostensible success of wartime economies operating at full employment, in contrast to the earlier frightening developments of DATE, thwarted a full dismantlement of wartime regimens when hostilities came to an end. Wage and price controls, coupled with rationing, lingered in many economies well into DATE. Because full employment was no longer perceived as ensured by the marketplace, government initiatives promoting job growth dominated the postwar economic policy framework of the Western democracies. In the United States, the Congress passed, and the President signed, the \"Employment Act of DATE.\" However, cracks in the facade of government economic management emerged early in DATE, and those cracks were to continue widening as time passed. Britain's heavily controlled economy was under persistent stress as it vaulted from one crisis to another in DATE. In the United States, unbalanced macroeconomic policies led to a gradual uptrend in the rate of inflation in DATE. The imposition of wage and price controls in DATE to deal with the problem of inflation proved unworkable and ineffective. The notion that the centrally planned Soviet economy was catching up with the West was, by DATE, increasingly viewed as dubious, though it was not fully discarded until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in DATE exposing the economic ruin behind the iron curtain. The East-West divisions following World War II engendered an unintended DATE-long experiment in comparative economic systems, which led, in the end, to a judgment by the vast majority of policymakers that market economies were unequivocally superior to those managed by central planning. Many developing nations abandoned their Soviet-type economic systems for more market-based regimes. But even earlier in the developed world, distortions induced by regulation were more and more disturbing. In response, starting in DATE, American Presidents, supported by bipartisan majorities in the Congress, deregulated large segments of the transportation, communications, energy, and financial services industries. The stated purpose was to enhance competition, which was increasingly seen as a significant spur to productivity growth and elevated standards of living. Assisting in the dismantling of economic rigidities was the seemingly glacial, but persistent, lowering of barriers to cross-border trade and finance. As a consequence, the United States, then widely seen as a once great economic power that had lost its way, gradually moved back to the forefront of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, called \"creative destruction,\" the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way for the innovative. In that paradigm, standards of living rise because depreciation and other cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. Workers, of necessity, migrate with the capital. Through this process, wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step, as high levels of productivity associated with innovative technologies displace lesser productive capabilities. The model presupposes the continuous churning of a flexible competitive economy in which the new displaces the old. The success of that strategy in the United States confirmed, by DATE, the earlier views that a loosening of regulatory restraint on business would improve the flexibility of our economy. Flexibility implies a faster response to shocks and a correspondingly greater ability to absorb their downside consequences and to recover from their aftermath. No specific program encompassed and coordinated initiatives to enhance flexibility, but there was a growing recognition, both in the United States and among many of our trading partners, that a market economy could best withstand and recover from shocks when provided maximum flexibility. Developments that enhanced flexibility ranged far beyond regulatory or statutory change. For example, employers have long been able to legally discharge employees at modest cost. But in DATE, profitable large corporations were dissuaded from wholesale job reduction. Contractual inhibitions, to be sure, were then decidedly more prevalent than DATE, but of far greater importance, our culture in the aftermath of depression frowned on such action. Only when bankruptcy threatened was it perceived to be acceptable. But as the depression receded into history, attitudes toward job security and tenure changed. The change was first evidenced by the eventual acceptance by the American public of President Reagan's discharge of federally employed air traffic controllers in DATE when they engaged in an illegal strike. Job security, not a major concern of the average worker in DATE, became a significant issue especially in labor negotiations. By DATE, the climate had so changed that laying off workers to facilitate cost reduction had become a prevalent practice. Whether this seeming greater capacity to discharge workers would increase or decrease the level of structural unemployment was uncertain, however. In the event, structural unemployment decreased because the broadened freedom to discharge workers rendered hiring them less of a potentially costly long-term commitment. The increased flexibility of our labor market is now judged an important contributor to economic resilience and growth. American workers, to a large extent, see this connection and, despite the evident tradeoff between flexibility and job security, have not opposed innovation. An appreciation of the benefits of flexibility also has been growing elsewhere. Germany recently passed labor reforms, as have other continental European nations. U.K. labor markets, of course, have also experienced significant increases in flexibility in DATE. Beyond deregulation and culture change, innovative technologies, especially information technology, have been major contributors to enhanced flexibility. DATE, companies often required DATE to unearth a possible inventory imbalance, allowing production to continue to exacerbate the excess. Excessive inventories, in turn, necessitated a deeper decline in output for a time than would have been necessary had the knowledge of their status been fully current. The advent of innovative information technologies has significantly foreshortened the reporting lag, enabling flexible real-time responses to emerging imbalances. Deregulation and the newer information technologies have joined, in the United States and elsewhere, to advance financial flexibility, which in the end may be the most important contributor to the evident significant gains in economic stability over DATE. Historically, banks have been at the forefront of financial intermediation, in part because their ability to leverage offered an efficient source of funding. But too often in periods of severe financial stress, such leverage brought down numerous, previously vaunted banking institutions, and precipitated a financial crisis that led to recession or worse. But recent regulatory reform coupled with innovative technologies has spawned rapidly growing markets for, among many other products, asset-backed securities, collateral loan obligations, and credit derivative default swaps. Financial derivatives, more generally, have grown throughout the world at a phenomenal rate of NUM percent per DATE over DATE. Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily deflected in DATE. The new instruments of risk dispersion have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks in their credit-granting role to divest themselves of much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far less leverage. Insurance companies, especially those in reinsurance, pension funds, and hedge funds continue to be willing, at a price, to supply this credit protection, despite the significant losses on such products that some of these investors experienced during the past three DATEs. These increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed, especially over the recent stressful period, to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than existed just a DATE. One prominent example was the response of financial markets to a burgeoning and then deflating telecommunications sector. Worldwide borrowing by telecommunications firms in all currencies amounted to more than the equivalent of one trillion U.S. dollars during the DATEs NUM to NUM. The financing of the massive expansion of fiber-optic networks and heavy investments in third-generation mobile-phone licenses by European firms strained debt markets. At the time, the financing of these investments was widely seen as prudent because the telecommunications borrowers had very high valuations in equity markets, which could facilitate a stock issuance, if needed, to pay down bank loans and other debt. In the event, of course, prices of telecommunications stocks collapsed, and many firms went bankrupt. Write-downs were heavy, especially in continental Europe, but unlike in previous periods of large financial distress, no major financial institution defaulted, and the world economy was not threatened. Thus, in stark contrast to many previous episodes, the global financial system exhibited a remarkable ability to absorb and recover from shocks.    The most significant lesson to be learned from recent economic history is arguably the importance of structural flexibility and the resilience to economic shocks that it imparts. The more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct in response to inevitable, often unanticipated, disturbances and thus to contain the size and consequences of cyclical imbalances. Enhanced flexibility has the advantage of being able to adjust automatically and not having to rest on policymakers' initiatives, which often come too late or are misguided. I do not claim to be able to judge the relative importance of conventional stimulus and increased economic flexibility to our ability to weather the shocks of the past few DATEs. But it is difficult to dismiss improved flexibility as having played a key role in the U.S. economy's recent relative stability. In fact, the past two recessions in the United States were the mildest in the postwar period. The experience of Britain and many others during this period of time have been similar.    I do not doubt that the vast majority of us would prefer to work in an environment that was less stressful and less competitive than the one with which we currently engage. The cries of distress amply demonstrate that flexibility and its consequence, rigorous competition, are not universally embraced. Flexibility in labor policies, for example, appears in some contexts to be the antithesis of job security. Yet, in our roles as consumers, we seem to insist on the low product prices and high quality that are the most prominent features of our current frenetic economic structure. If a producer can offer quality at a lower price than the competition, retailers are pressed to respond because the consumer will otherwise choose a shopkeeper who does. Retailers are afforded little leeway in product sourcing and will seek out low-cost producers, whether they are located in Guangdong province in China or northern England. If consumers are stern taskmasters of their marketplace, business purchasers of capital equipment and production materials inputs have taken the competitive paradigm a step further and applied it on a global scale. From an economic perspective, the globe has indeed shrunk. Not only have the costs of transporting goods and services, relative to the total value of trade, declined over most of the postwar period, but international travel costs, relative to incomes, are down, and cross-border communications capabilities have risen dramatically with the introduction of the Internet and the use of satellites. National boundaries are less and less a barrier to trade as companies more and more manufacture in many countries and move parts and components across national boundaries with the same ease of movement exhibited DATE within national economies. A consequence, in the eyes of many, if not most, economists, world per capita real GDP over DATE has risen almost NUM-NUM/NUM percent DATE, and the proportion of the developing world's population that live on less than one dollar per day has markedly declined. Yet globalization is by no means universally admired. The frenetic pace of the competition that has characterized markets' extended global reach has engendered major churnings in labor and product markets. The sensitivity of the U.S. economy and many of our trading partners to foreign competition appears to have intensified recently as technological obsolescence has continued to foreshorten the expected profitable life of each nation's capital stock. The more rapid turnover of our equipment and plant, as one might expect, is mirrored in an increased turnover of jobs. A million American workers, for example, currently leave their jobs DATE, two-fifths involuntarily, often in association with facilities that have been displaced or abandoned. A million, more or less, are also newly hired or returned from layoffs DATE, in part as new facilities come on stream. Related to this process, jobs in the United States have been perceived as migrating abroad over the DATEs, to low-wage Japan in DATE, to low-wage Mexico in DATE, and most recently to low-wage China. Japan, of course, is no longer characterized by a low-wage workforce, and many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to low-wage China. In developed countries, conceptual jobs, fostered by cutting-edge technologies, are occupying an ever-increasing share of the workforce and are gradually replacing work that requires manual skills. Those industries in which labor costs are a significant part of overall costs have been under greater competition from foreign producers with lower labor costs, adjusted for productivity. This process is not new. For generations human ingenuity has been creating industries and jobs that never before existed, from vehicle assembling to computer software engineering. With those jobs come new opportunities for workers with the necessary skills. In DATE, competition from abroad has risen to a point at which developed countries' lowest skilled workers are being priced out of the global labor market. This diminishing of opportunities for such workers is why retraining for new job skills that meet the evolving opportunities created by our economies has become so urgent a priority. A major source of such retraining in the United States has been our community colleges, which have proliferated over DATE. We can usually identify somewhat in advance which tasks are most vulnerable to being displaced by foreign or domestic competition. But in economies at the forefront of technology, most new jobs are the consequence of innovation, which by its nature is not easily predictable. What we in the United States do know is that, over the DATEs, more than NUM percent of our workforce, on average, has been employed as markets matched idled workers seeking employment to new jobs. We can thus be confident that new jobs will displace old ones as they always have, but not without a high degree of pain for those caught in the job-losing segment of America's massive job-turnover process.    The onset of far greater flexibility in DATE in the labor and product markets of the United States and the United Kingdom, to name just two economies, raises the possibility of the resurrection of confidence in the automatic rebalancing ability of markets, so prevalent in the period before Keynes. In its modern incarnation, the reliance on markets acknowledges limited roles for both countercyclical macroeconomic policies and market-sensitive regulatory frameworks. The central burden of adjustment, however, is left to economic agents operating freely and in their own self-interest in dynamic and interrelated markets. The benefits of having moved in this direction over DATE are increasingly apparent. The United States has experienced DATE declines in real GDP exceeding NUM percent at an DATE rate on only three occasions over the past twenty DATEs. Britain has gone DATE without a downturn. Nonetheless, so long as markets are free and human beings exhibit swings of euphoria and distress, the business cycle will continue to plague us. But even granting human imperfections, flexible economic institutions appear to significantly ameliorate the amplitude and duration of the business cycle. The benefits seem sufficiently large that special emphasis should be placed on searching for policies that will foster still greater economic flexibility while seeking opportunities to dismantle policies that contribute to unnecessary rigidity. Let me raise one final caution in this otherwise decidedly promising scenario. Disoriented by the quickened pace of DATE's competition, some in the United States look back with nostalgia to the seemingly more tranquil DATEs of the early post-World War II period, when tariff walls were perceived as providing job security from imports. Were we to yield to such selective nostalgia and shut out a large part, or all, of imports of manufactured goods and produce those goods ourselves, our overall standards of living would fall. In DATE's flexible markets, our large, but finite, capital and labor resources are generally employed most effectively. Any diversion of resources from the market-guided activities would, of necessity, engender a less-productive mix. For the most part, we in the United States have not engaged in significant and widespread protectionism for DATE. The consequences of moving in that direction in DATE's far more globalized financial world could be unexpectedly destabilizing. I remain optimistic that we and our global trading partners will shun that path. The evidence is simply too compelling that our mutual interests are best served by promoting the free flow of goods and services among our increasingly flexible and dynamic market economies.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Observations on measuring and managing operational risk under Basel II Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve System's Conference on Implementing an Advanced Measurement Approach for Operational Risk, Boston, DATE.    Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve's conference - \"Implementing an Advanced Measurement Approach for Operational Risk.\" It gives me great pleasure to open this conference. I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Board staff for organizing this important event and all the speakers for the time and effort they have devoted to making this conference worthwhile. Indeed, judging from the impressive lineup of speakers, this conference should be a highly useful forum for an exchange of ideas. I also want to extend a special welcome to the international supervisors and bankers who are in attendance. I know that some of you have spent the earlier part of DATE sharing your views about and experiences with the implementation of the Basel II operational risk framework and working to achieve an appropriate level of consistency in implementation across countries. Our hope is that this conference will broaden and deepen the understanding within the banking and regulatory community of operational-risk measurement techniques, both quantitative and qualitative, particularly as they relate to the development of the advanced measurement approaches, or AMAs. I think you have an interesting DATE ahead of you, with an opportunity to hear the current state of implementation from banks and regulators. Specifically, TIME you will hear supervisors describe the range of practices they observed during the \"interagency AMA benchmarking exercise\" conducted DATE at institutions that will likely be required to adopt Basel II. They will also summarize the results of the operational-risk-loss data-collection exercise and Fourth Quantitative Impact Study - known as QIS4. TIME you will hear from academics and practitioners who are experts in measuring operational risk, and DATE you will hear from financial institutions who will share their practical experiences in designing and implementing operational-risk measurement systems and then from regulators on the outstanding policy issues. DATE, I would like to address some of the practical aspects of implementing Basel II in the United States, including some observations on progress being made in the management and measurement of operational risk as well as some observations on the challenges associated with implementing an AMA. Implementation of Basel II in the United States The agencies' reaction to the results of QIS4 shows how seriously we are taking Basel II implementation. As you probably know, the agencies issued a statement on DATE indicating that results from QIS4 were more widely dispersed and showed a larger overall drop in capital than we had expected. This was the impetus for deciding to delay issuance of our next round of proposals for Basel II. These unexpected results show the continued benefit of conducting periodic quantitative impact studies. They serve as a milestone to help us calibrate the progress of the framework and the bankers as we move to Basel II. We now must determine the reasons for the unexpected results from QIS4. Do they reflect actual differences in risk among respondents when prior supervisory information suggested more similarity in credit quality? None of the participating banks has completed their databases and models for all of their risk areas. In some cases, this created results that would not be reliable for implementing Basel II. For example, for some portfolios, expected losses reflected only the DATE or two of results. Thus, the strong credit performance of recent experience was not balanced by higher losses at other points of the credit cycle. Were there limits of the QIS4 exercise itself? Is there a possible need for adjustments to the Basel framework? Analyzing the data used in QIS4 is vitally important, because ultimately the success of Basel II will depend on the quantity and quality of data that banks have to use as inputs to the framework. U.S. regulators expect to provide additional information on the lessons we learn from the QIS4 review in the near future. The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for Basel II will incorporate what we learn from this exercise. But we really are caught in a process dilemma. Bankers cannot complete their models and collect the necessary data until they know what the specific requirements will be. Regulators, on the other hand, will have to develop these requirements before seeing the actual results of these models and robust databases. Given what a vast undertaking Basel II is, this seems entirely appropriate and beneficial. In addition to what we learn from the work on QIS4 results, we will also assess the trading and banking book comments of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. We will incorporate the latest proposal into the notice of proposed rulemaking and hope to complete our efforts in a timely manner. In addition, under our current plans, we also will be delaying issuance of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to revise current capital rules for non-Basel II banks. U.S. banking regulators have longed recognized that the existing capital rules need to be updated. These modifications are needed to reflect changing products and risk exposures and also to address potential competitive impacts from Basel II. We plan to issue these proposals for public comment concurrently with, or soon after, the NPR on Basel II to allow the banking community to comment on a combined package. I will now turn to some observations about operational risk. Observations related to implementing an AMA As you may know, I have spent much of my career in the field of risk management, and of course the Federal Reserve has a keen interest in this topic. For those of us who have spent DATE in the business, it is easy to see the recent progress in the quantitative aspects of risk management brought about by improved databases and technological advances. Indeed, the development of techniques for the measurement and management of operational risk is very dynamic, with much progress being made relatively recently. Evidence of this dynamic development process can be seen in the results of an interagency AMA benchmarking exercise conducted DATE, as well as the results of the operational-risk-loss data-collection exercise and QIS4. In fact, one very encouraging sign of progress in measuring operational risk is the broad participation we saw in the loss data-collection exercise and on the operational-risk portions of QIS4. As you will hear in more detail later TIME, twenty-seven institutions participated in these exercises; and it appears that, based on our preliminary analysis of the submissions, significant progress has been made in the collection of operational-risk data and the quantification of operational risk. A review of the loss data submitted by you and your colleagues shows a substantial increase in the number of institutions collecting operational-risk data over DATE. In addition, the QIS4 responses suggest that although significant quantification challenges remain, many institutions are developing sophisticated approaches for measuring their operational-risk exposure. It has often been argued that measuring operational risk is much more difficult than measuring market or credit risk. The lack of a consistent definition of operational risk (until recently); the central role of the internal control environment; the relatively short time span of historical loss data; and the important role of infrequent, but very large, loss events are just some of the challenges that operational-risk measurement systems have had to confront. Coming up with credible ways of capturing the tail of the loss distribution and, just as important, of verifying that it has been captured in a reasonably accurate and consistent way, have presented interesting challenges to those developing operational-risk measurement frameworks. But, in a very real sense, these challenges have become the true strengths of the operational-risk measurement discipline. As will be very evident from the presentations over the next DATE, tremendous creativity and insight have been brought to bear on the issue of operational-risk measurement. To address the difficulties presented by the very nature of the risk, the designers of operational-risk measurement frameworks have had to be more innovative, take bigger steps into new territory, and be more willing to step away from traditional - and comfortably familiar - techniques than their counterparts in the market- and credit-risk arenas. Designers of operational-risk measurement systems have had to do some really fundamental thinking about the goals of risk measurement and about the tools used to achieve those goals. As a result, we have seen innovation in the use of \"soft\" data derived from scenario analysis, risk self-assessments, and the judgment of senior business managers. We have seen creativity in the melding of internal and external loss data to guide thinking about internal loss exposures. Perhaps most significantly, we have seen some truly innovative thinking about ways to integrate operational-risk measurement into the broader framework of operational-risk management. I commend you on all that you have accomplished to date, but substantial work remains to be accomplished before Basel II can \"go live.\" I strongly encourage both bankers and supervisors to continue their efforts to support the evolution of operational-risk measurement and management practices. One of the major challenges bankers face in implementing an AMA is creating a credible database of internal loss-event data on which to base the AMA capital charge. Another, and no less important, challenge is ensuring that operational-risk measurement and management systems are integrated into the day-to-day decisionmaking processes of your institution. The focus on enhanced risk management in Basel II means that banks should not view Basel II preparations with a checklist mentality. Rather, they should be moving ahead on many fronts, looking at how to make the fundamental changes needed for better risk identification, measurement, management, and control. By doing so, banks can position themselves to succeed in implementing an operational risk-management and -measurement system on a timely basis. We do, however, recognize that a certain time constraint exists for institutions wishing to implement the new framework. On the one hand, banks are encouraged to start preparations as soon as possible; on the other hand, we leave open the possibility that elements of the framework are subject to change. This is not a trivial matter. As a former banker, I sympathize with the challenges you face in deciding on investments and upgrades to your systems and personnel. When it comes to Basel II, we recognize that certain details relating to systems and processes will depend on what the final U.S. rule and guidance contain. Accordingly, your primary supervisor is available to discuss your implementation efforts and we want to hear specifics about which elements of the proposal, from your perspective, will demand the greatest investments or appear to generate the greatest uncertainty. Using that information, the agencies can then understand where to target resources to assist banks during the transition to Basel II. We certainly hope that many upgrades made for Basel II are those that would have been made anyway to strengthen enterprise-risk management. An additional challenge that you face in implementing an AMA is that operational risk has only relatively recently risen to management and regulatory attention - not because it was previously unimportant, but because it has been so difficult to measure. As QIS4 has demonstrated, we are still in the early stages of measuring this risk, and the challenges in gathering the relevant data and developing the models are still great. The main reason for the lack of data, as I am sure many of you know firsthand, is simply the fact that most banks have only recently started systematically collecting operational-loss data. While the importance of models and loss data in quantifying operational risk may be quite apparent - at least to practitioners of the art - the importance of the qualitative aspects may be less so. In practice, though, these qualitative aspects are no less important to the successful operation of a business - as events continue to demonstrate. Some qualitative factors, such as experience and judgment, affect what one does with model results. It is important that we not let models make the decisions, that we keep in mind that they are just tools, because in many cases it is management experience - aided by models to be sure - that helps to limit losses. Some qualitative factors affect what the models and risk measures say, including the parameters and modeling assumptions used and the choices that relate to the characteristics of the underlying data and the historical period from which the data are drawn. I think you will hear a common theme DATE and DATE: Value is added to the firm when operational-risk measurement is integrated with the business-unit management processes. In other words, the business-line staff should be in the process of developing the firm-wide operational-risk measurement framework. While firms generally are developing corporate-level operational-risk management functions and firm-wide policies and procedures to bring greater consistency to how operational risk is measured throughout the institution, business-line staff can add significant value to this effort through their understanding of inherent risks and controls in their areas. And finally, the more business- line staff is involved in the development of the measurement framework and the more transparent the framework is, the more credible will be the process of allocating the total capital number back to the business lines - an effort in which many of the banks represented here DATE are now engaged. To be meaningful, the quantification of operational risk must be forward-looking. This means that a mechanical focus on historic loss data series will not work. We must recognize the roles of qualitative factors and a well-reasoned assessment of what we will call stress events or scenario analysis. In this regard, the burden is on management to exercise judgment. Clearly, this judgment must include consideration not only of a soundness standard but also of contingencies and actions taken to reduce the risks posed by those contingencies. A self-assessment of the internal control structure and overall risk-management process is crucial. Clearly, this is not a simple process if the results are to be relevant to the specific risk profile of the firm. But based on the progress we have seen to date in this area, I think you are up to the challenge and I encourage you to keep moving forward. Before I wrap up, I would like to say a few words directly to the potential \"opt-in\" institutions. An institution that does not meet the mandatory criteria in the framework will be under no obligation to adopt Basel II. Some potential opt-in institutions have complex and varied operations and are developing enhanced enterprise-wide risk-management processes and systems to strengthen their internal control environments. These institutions understand that complex operations receive a more structured and well-defined risk-management framework to monitor the effectiveness of internal control processes and risk exposures. For these organizations, the incremental cost to opt into Basel II advanced approaches will be a relatively moderate incremental cost. For other financial institutions, with a simpler organizational structure and less-complex processes and services, a less-sophisticated enterprise-wide risk-management and -measurement is entirely appropriate. For these organizations, the incremental cost to develop advanced Basel II systems can be substantial. These organizations may appropriately choose not to adopt Basel II, especially at the earliest possible date. If they choose to opt in, they may want to implement Basel II later when they can take advantage of third-party models and databases to assist in the development of their systems at much lower costs. Also, I would like to quell any concerns that potential opt-in institutions may have about being viewed as having inferior risk-management systems if they decide not to adopt Basel II. It is important for you to know that, as supervisors, we will not look upon institutions that decide not to adopt Basel II as having deficient risk-management systems simply because they choose to stay under the Basel I capital framework. As supervisors, our focus will continue to be on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate for operations of each institution and that those risk systems operate effectively. Thus, we expect that non-Basel II banks will continue to have CAMELS NUM and NUM ratings as they operate in a safe and sound manner. As Basel II implementation continues, customers, credit rating agencies, and analysts should also understand these fundamental concepts of effective risk management and internal controls. Conclusion In my remarks DATE, I have encouraged you to continue your efforts to support the evolution of operational-risk measurement and management practices. I want to end by reminding all of you not to become so caught up in the latest technical developments that you lose sight of the qualitative aspects of your responsibilities. Models alone do not guarantee an effective risk-management process. You should encourage continuous improvement in all aspects, including data integrity and internal controls, to name just a few. For the risk managers at this conference, I hope the message you have heard is that you should be actively engaged with managers throughout the organization, talking about the merits of a consistent, sound enterprise-wide risk-management culture. In doing so, you can help managers see that the risk-management process will allow them to better understand the inherent risks of their activities so that they in turn can more effectively mitigate these risks and achieve their profit goals in a safe and sound manner. The agencies will continue to provide as much information as possible to help potential opt-in institutions make their decisions. Our supervisory teams continue to stand ready to discuss Basel II issues with all institutions and answer any questions that arise.",

                  "William L Rutledge: Basel II - risk management and financial stability Remarks by Mr William L Rutledge, Executive Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey's International Conference on Financial Stability and Implications of Basel II, Istanbul, DATE.    Let me begin by commending the organizers for pulling together such a timely and important conference - Basel II promises to be a watershed event in global financial stability, and giving a full airing of the issues associated with its introduction is particularly important as we draw closer to implementation. I am very pleased to be able to participate in the discussion of those issues - the views I offer will naturally be my own rather than necessarily those of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has major roles both as a bank supervisor, and, more broadly as a central bank, for fostering financial stability. Basel II has direct and significant implications for these several roles; it will clearly be an integral part of our supervisory approach going forward, and its emphasis on strong risk management practices also supports our broader financial stability mandate. My comments will set to the side calibration issues and focus particularly on what I believe are two major ways in which the basic structure and operational requirements of Basel II should enhance the stability of the financial system. The first is that the new Accord should provide an improved and more comparable way to look at risktaking across organizations. Accordingly, it will allow market participants, supervisors, and the banks themselves to be more effective in detecting changes in risk levels, and to better assess the appropriateness of particular capital levels supporting such risks. A second major contribution of Basel II to financial stability is that the preparations for, and the final implementation of the Accord, will result in increased resources applied to improving bank risk management practices. This should result in pricing becoming more reflective of risk, and in better capital allocation across firms, borrowers and industries. Basel II has, without question, already led financial institutions to deepen and accelerate their efforts to improve the evaluation, quantification and disclosure of risk. These beneficial effects will not just happen, but rather will require major efforts on the part of the private and public sectors. Moreover, there are also possible negative effects of Basel II to evaluate and factor in to our approaches - a topic that I will also touch on briefly. Limitations of Basel I and current supervisory approach In thinking about the effects of Basel II, it is useful to step back and look at the current supervisory and regulatory framework - taking into account the Capital Accord currently in effect and how it is used in our supervisory processes. The original Basel Capital Accord was itself a landmark event, revolutionary in providing a common capital assessment approach, now used by over NUM countries. However, it has obvious limitations that have become more significant over time. It has become less and less reflective of the risks of our largest organizations, and, accordingly, has become less and less integral to our ongoing supervision of them. Basel I, as we all know, includes such shortcomings as: a) its failure to recognize differing credit quality within the same general asset type; b) its varying the capital charge with the credit exposure's legal form, such as whether it is on or off balance sheet; and c) its simplistic approach to risk transference and credit risk mitigation. More generally, Basel I was not structured to keep pace with the rapid rate of financial innovation that we have seen in internationally active banks. It clearly has created incentives for capital arbitrage, with banks able to structure transactions with the primary goal of minimizing regulatory requirements without a commensurate reduction in risk. Similarly, it has resulted in distortions in bank activity, by creating a tax on certain activities while understating the risk for others. These have combined to make the regulatory capital metric less informative to investors, supervisors and counterparties, and have eroded the principle of adequate risk-based capitalization that the Basel Accord was designed to promote. I should emphasize that the weaknesses of the current regulatory capital framework are much more relevant to the supervision of the largest and most sophisticated banks than they are generally across the industry. For the vast majority of the thousands of U.S. banks, the existing regime largely works. In recognition of this, among other considerations, we expect that in the U.S. most banks will stay on Basel I while the largest and internationally active banks will adopt the advanced Basel II approaches. We are considering some simple adjustments to Basel I to ensure that the framework is up to date and that there is competitive equity with Basel II adopters. In any event, the lack of risk sensitivity and incentives for arbitrage have made Basel I less relevant in our supervision of the largest banks - it is a benchmark requirement to be met, but not, in practice, a critical discriminating factor as we judge their financial condition. As supervisors, we have focused increasingly on assessing the rigor and effectiveness of each organization's risk management and control systems. We have looked to understand the risk appetite of each firm, and then assess how well it is able to measure and manage the resulting degree of risk taking. A key recent part of the supervisory effort has been to encourage the development of banks' internal economic capital models - models that link risk taking to capital and that look to compare risk taking, and the returns on risk, across business lines, regions and products. But the current stage of development of economic capital modeling - the differences in model construction, assumptions and coverage - limit our ability to make comparisons of the results across institutions. More generally, economic capital models clearly remain in an early evolutionary stage, most particularly regarding operational risk. Their early stage of development can also be seen in the relative paucity of disclosed economic capital estimates by banking firms. Only very recently have we begun to see that some bankers have sufficient confidence in the quality of their economic capital estimates, even of credit risk, to disclose them publicly. Basel II: Effects on comparability This brings me to Basel II. The new Accord links risk taking to capital adequacy in a meaningful and consistent way. Its systematic quantification of risk will give market participants new tools for viewing banks' capital positions - providing a strong basis for making comparisons across institutions and over time. While relying to a considerable extent on a firm's internal systems for generating credit risk and operational risk capital charges under the more advanced approaches, the new Accord establishes strong preconditions for firms to meet in using those methodologies. In doing so, it also puts a strong measure of responsibility on the supervisors to ensure that each firm is in fact adhering to those requirements - we cannot simply accept the legitimacy of such an important element of financial condition as capital adequacy without extensive and critical reviews of the processes that generate the numbers. With these elements in place, comparability should be greatly enhanced. Moreover, unlike Basel I, the new Accord allows for the evolution of bank practice over time by building on the core elements of a bank's internal methodologies - methodologies that are expected to continue to improve, particularly with supervisory and market encouragement. Basel II: Risk management improvements The second, and perhaps more significant, benefit I mentioned is the encouragement to improvements in bank risk management practices. Basel II has always had this objective in mind in addition to creating a stronger, more risk sensitive measure of bank capital. We are clearly already seeing this objective being realized. Basel II builds on risk measurement concepts that have emerged in the industry, although clearly the application of these leading practices varies within and across firms. There has been enormous progress as banks commit to programs that will bring their systems and practices into alignment with the standards articulated in Basel II. As I have emphasized, a major focus of our supervisory activities has been on ensuring that banks are actively engaged in advancing the linkage of quantified risk-taking to capital, as this is at the heart of both sound banking and Basel II. Let me offer some specific examples, beginning with credit risk and then turning to operational risk. An example can certainly be seen in the management of retail exposures. Over DATE, as the geographic dispersion and size of lending portfolios grew at large banks, and amid intense competition, reliance solely on expert judgment in the evaluation of the risks of retail exposures became less and less plausible. Banks developed, and continue to enhance sophisticated scoring systems to better express the likelihood of repayment of individual borrowers, and have grown increasingly sophisticated in their ability to segment exposures by characteristics that provide a fine classification of the risk of a homogenous pool of borrowers. Basel II allows banks to build off of these practices, bringing regulatory capital requirements into much closer alignment with internal economic capital estimates. Importantly however, this occurs only when banks use those models for risk management purposes - ensuring their continuing effectiveness. A key element of Basel II is that it establishes rigorous standards for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. The greatest challenge for the industry, and the greatest potential long-run benefit, involves the collection and categorization of accurate, detailed information on borrower and exposure characteristics and exposure performance. This involves significant investments in technology, and for some firms the revamping of historical underwriting practices. Enhancements to technological infrastructure and MIS, combined with detailed, granular data will, over time, prove a powerful combination allowing firms to better price exposures and manage risk. The emphasis in the new Accord on improved data standards should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital requirements, but rather as a foundation for risk management practices that will strengthen the value of the banking franchise. In addition to building on the current state of risk management practices, Basel II also promotes continued improvements in those practices. As I emphasized a moment ago, bank supervisors now are heavily focused on critically assessing risk management and control systems - where we find shortcomings, we constantly urge banks to make risk management improvements. Those shortcomings can reflect individual firm failings, in which case, we press the individual firms to bring their approaches up to the evolving best practices of well managed competitors. But the shortcomings can also reflect more systematic problems across the industry - necessitating supervisory efforts to move the industry ahead more broadly to improve its standards. Clearly, both through the microjudgments for individual firms and through the issuance of broader public guidance to address crossindustry concerns, the supervisory process is critical in ensuring improvements in risk management practices. Basel II can materially reinforce these efforts by setting strong qualification standards and capital incentives for firms to measure risk more accurately. Historically, the supervisory method for evaluating credit risk at banks in the U.S. focused on the identification of individual commercial loans that were already troubled. Bank supervision added value by assuring counterparties and market participants that banking entities had clean and accurate balance sheets by forcing the timely recognition of losses. More recently, in response to the development of rating systems, the supervisory effort has shifted to the evaluation of the credit risk management process, and specifically the quality of each bank's internal credit rating system. As supervisors we are no longer solely concerned with whether a bank has properly rated a troubled credit. Rather, we are now focused on the extent to which the bank can properly distinguish between loans across the spectrum of credit quality through its ratings, and whether these ratings are adjusted on a timely basis according to changes in a borrower's performance. With Basel II, there are requirements for a meaningful differentiation of risk, for credit ratings with integrity, and for a warehouse of data to support the ratings (and requirements to ensure that historical data horizons cover appropriate economic downturn conditions). Moreover, banks will be required to test their rating system's performance, resulting in more accurate ratings and capital assessments. In addition, through Pillar II, banks will be required to benchmark the results of their Pillar I credit assessments through rigorous stress testing. Basel II also sets rigorous standards for the recognition of credit risk mitigation, ensuring that firms have sound internal procedures for assessing the legal certainty of such mitigation, that they include the effects of netting and collateral and that they factor into their calculations mismatches in maturity between hedging and hedged instruments, as well as other forms of basis risk. The more recently issued Basel/IOSCO consultative document further raises the bar when it comes to recognizing the effects of double default in credit risk, modeling counterparty credit risk in an integrated manner that recognizes portfolio effects and improving the modeling of market risk, particularly as it relates to the growing exposure to credit-like risks within the trading book. Basel II already has had a particularly strong impact in improving the way the industry assesses its exposure to operational risk. Before the issuance of the Advanced Measurement Approach, many firms did not consider operational risk to be a discipline in its own right, as they did market and credit risk. Operational risk tended to be managed in a decentralized manner at the level of individual business lines and it was largely based on qualitative considerations. For many firms, operational risk really was focused on managing back-office operations and processes. With the introduction of the AMA, supervisors introduced a much more comprehensive framework for how firms should go about measuring and managing operational risk. Firms are required to have a much more comprehensive definition of what constitutes operational risk, including not only processing errors, but also business disruptions, legal and compliance risks and fraud, whether from internal or external sources. As with market and credit risk, firms are expected to supplement the management of operational risk at the business line level, with an independent operational risk management function that is responsible for establishing firmwide policies for measuring and managing operational risk. Finally, firms are required to bring together quantitative elements, such as internal and external loss data, with qualitative elements, such as control self assessments and scenarios, to arrive at a reasoned assessment of their exposure to operational risk losses across the firm. Internal rating systems, credit risk mitigation and operational risk measurement are merely a few of the examples of how Basel II has already spurred improvements in bank risk management and how final implementation will bring further discipline to risk management practice. Supervisors also will have to make judgments about the effectiveness of the models and associated procedures that banks intend to use for regulatory capital purposes. A key element in making such judgments is the so-called \"use test\" which requires that banks' regulatory capital models build on the models that they use for internal risk management purposes. This is a necessary condition for supervisors to have confidence in the integrity of banks' regulatory capital models. Additionally, Pillars II and III give added impetus to comprehensive improvements in bank management practice. Under Pillar II, supervisors will assess the integrity of banks' internal economic capital models - focusing on aspects that are not well-captured in the Pillar I framework, such as the firm's correlation assumptions within and across portfolios and the rigor of its stress testing programs. Finally, under Pillar III, supervisors will seek to ensure that accurate information about risks will be disclosed by banking organizations. Areas of possible concern with Basel II Procyclicality While I have emphasized the various benefits of Basel II for effective supervision and the preservation of financial stability, there clearly are some possible downsides of the new approach. Concerns have been raised that the adoption of the new Accord will have some destabilizing effects on the international financial system, and emerging market economies in particular. Chief among these is the concern that Basel II will amplify procyclicality as Basel II adopters severely tighten credit standards in response to rising capital requirements in the event of deterioration of credit conditions. We do expect that minimum capital requirements will rise and fall in response to changes in the risk of a bank's activities, just as the internal economic capital models currently used by banks reflect changing risk exposure by changing capital levels. By itself, this will mean that, even with some changes the Basel Committee made over DATE to lessen the effect, some procyclicality still remains. However, the procyclicality debate should include not only whether capital requirements will rise and fall with economic cycles, but also whether the new requirements provide useful signals to banks, supervisors, and market participants that will lead them to take appropriate action in response to a changing economic environment. With more gradations in the Basel II framework, banks, supervisors and the marketplace will have an early warning signal when credit quality deteriorates and when it improves. A more risk sensitive measure should give bank managers accurate signals to adjust lending policies in a more gradual manner early in cycles, dampening severe contractions or expansions in lending. With its emphasis on planning and risk analysis, the new Accord will require banks (and their supervisors and rating agencies) to think more systematically about the level of capital needed during upturns in order to weather downturns. Herding behavior Another concern that some have raised is that the uniformity imposed by Basel II in calculating capital requirements will result in homogeneous assessments of risk, which in turn will amplify herding behavior in the market place. The new Accord does set requirements for bank risk management by requiring certain types of inputs, and it does set the correlation factors for asset types, but it does not mandate that all banks must have the same assessment of their inputs. Individual banks will still have different methodologies for arriving at the inputs based on their reasoned assessment of risk, and banks' estimates will clearly vary according to their business strategies and the nature of their portfolios. Concerns that Basel II will be destabilizing for emerging markets Another charge leveled at Basel II is that increased capital requirements for lending to emerging market economies will cause banks to reduce credit extensions. Here I think it is particularly important to consider the current reality of banks' decision-making processes. Internationally active banks are not currently making lending decisions primarily on the basis of Basel I capital requirements - rather, they are using their internal risk ratings systems and economic capital models for pricing and lending decisions. These internal models and capital requirements are far more constraining than Basel I requirements. Therefore, when we try to gauge the impact that Basel II will have on emerging market lending, the pertinent comparison is not with Basel I, but with the internal risk ratings and economic capital systems that internationally active banks now use. As such, we do not expect major changes in international lending as a result of Basel II requirements. Additionally, Basel II will bring stabilizing benefits to emerging markets that are often overlooked. The sharp distinction in capital charges for longer-term lending versus short-term loans under Basel I has created some distorted incentives, particularly with regard to emerging market lending. The new rules will remove these incentives for short-term lending - a form of lending that can be especially destabilizing to emerging markets during financial stress. The adoption of Basel II internationally will have the benefit of spreading stronger risk management practices to all countries, including emerging market nations. This is not to say that Basel II is the right answer for all banks or all countries at this time, but rather that all countries should work to adopt various of its underlying principles in assessing banks' risk management systems and in promoting transparency and disclosure. Investors and rating agencies would then have a better understanding of the risk profile of emerging market banks, which could result in a reduction of the risk premium currently applied to some emerging market lending. Conclusion In wrapping up, I would emphasize that implementation of Basel II should help supervisors and market participants better detect increases in risk in individual institutions and across the financial system through a more risk sensitive capital measure. Basel II also promises to reinforce and accelerate improvements in bank risk management globally, as well as promote future innovations through its reliance on banks' internal methodologies. How well these improvements unfold will depend critically on the actions of supervisors in integrating the new regulatory capital requirements with their overall supervisory and regulatory approach.

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: International financial reporting and auditing Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the Financial Stability Forum, International Accounting Standards Board, and International Federation of Accountants Roundtable on Financial Reporting and Auditing, Paris, DATE (via videoconference).    It is a pleasure to join you for this joint Roundtable on Financial Reporting and Auditing. As chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, I would like to express my appreciation to all of you that are participating in this roundtable as distinguished speakers or in other roles. In addition, I appreciate the very good partnership that we have had with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and with our host, the World Bank, in preparing for this gathering. Since our last joint Roundtable in DATE, much has transpired in the international accounting and auditing arenas. Indeed, DATE was a very big implementation year for international standards around the world. The topics of this Roundtable--dealing with the experience of implementing IASB and IFAC standards and related regulatory challenges, international convergence and harmonization, issues associated with using fair values in the financial reporting model, and risks and vulnerabilities arising from the financial reporting chain--all reflect the interconnectedness of accounting, auditing, and regulation and the need to consider these issues from the unique perspectives that all of you bring to the table. It is very important that this type of constructive dialogue continues to take place among the many key stakeholders in the financial reporting chain. The focus of the roundtable--international financial reporting and auditing--continues to gain increased attention from members of the international regulatory community such as the Financial Stability Forum, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), and the Basel Committee as well as from national supervisors, standards setters, banks, investors, analysts, auditors, and many others. As we all know, in DATE, accounting and auditing scandals and other developments have found their way onto the front pages of your DATE newspapers in ways rarely seen before. These challenging developments have led to a new resolve on the part of governmental, regulatory, and business leaders that there must be a reinforcement and improvement of standards-setting processes and a return to sound accounting, auditing, and disclosure practices by companies and their auditors. The unprecedented problems of DATE fueled efforts to help restore investor confidence in U.S. and European capital markets through legislative reforms affecting both the accounting profession and corporate management and directors. For example, these efforts led to, for example, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States which set the stage for a new audit oversight authority--the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board--to regulate, inspect, report on, and in some cases enforce penalties against auditors and led to new requirements for corporate management to maintain strong internal controls and to make periodic public reports on the adequacy of their companies' internal controls. In the European Union, the Eighth Directive and other initiatives were undertaken in recognition of the important role of audit oversight authorities. These initiatives seek to strengthen accounting standards, internal controls, and transparency. But long before these legislative initiatives were being considered, steps were taken to establish independent international standards-setting frameworks for both accounting and auditing standards, as reflected by the creation of the IASB in DATE and the IFAC International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (or IAASB). Both of these standards-setting processes have been reviewed and enhanced over time and continue to be subject to improvements. In his keynote speech TIME, Michel Prada shared with you IOSCO's initiatives to address international accounting and auditing issues. It is clear that IOSCO has played a very important role in these arenas for DATE. Likewise, central banks and banking supervisors have taken steps to enhance their focus on accounting and auditing matters that affect institutions they supervise. During DATE, the Basel Committee started to devote more resources to developing principles that would help shape and improve bank disclosure, supervisory reporting, and accounting practices. Moreover, the committee recognized that it was also important to support high-quality standardssetting processes. With the formation of the Accounting Task Force by the Basel Committee in DATE, the Basel Committee began to participate more actively in processes for setting accounting and auditing standards. This participation led to the development of enhanced accounting guidance on financial instruments and more comprehensive bank audit guidance. The IAIS has also shown a strong interest in the development of sound international accounting and auditing standards, as evidenced by its participation in the IASB's Insurance Working Group and the recent Group of Thirty (G-NUM) effort to enhance the transparency of reinsurance activities. All of these positive efforts by regulators and supervisors reflect a growing recognition that sound accounting policies and meaningful public disclosure by banking and other financial organizations and by nonbanking companies can improve market discipline. With sufficient, accurate, and relevant information, market participants can better evaluate counterparty risks and adjust the availability and pricing of funds to promote better allocation of financial resources. Thus, more-effective market discipline can, in a sense, \"regulate\" the risk-taking activities of banks and other firms in ways that can complement supervision and regulation of financial institutions and foster stable financial markets. The concept of market discipline has assumed greater importance among international banking supervisors with the publication of the new International Capital Framework, called Basel II, which seeks to strengthen the market's ability to aid bank supervisors in regulating capital adequacy. As you know, in addition to pillars on risk-based capital requirements (pillar NUM) and risk-based supervision (pillar NUM), Basel II includes the very important pillar NUM, which addresses disclosure of risks and capital adequacy to enhance market discipline. This approach to capital regulation, with its market-discipline component, signals that sound accounting and disclosure will continue to be important parts of the global bank supervisory approach for DATE to come. In addition to disclosure and market discipline, supervisors and regulators around the world recognize the need for stronger audit and control standards for financial services firms and other companies. The quality of management information and supervisory and financial reporting is dramatically affected by internal control systems, including internal audit programs and reviews by external auditors. Sound supervisory and financial reporting, good internal controls, and quality audits are becoming more important to financial services regulators because they directly affect regulators' ability to promptly identify institutions in distress and work toward a satisfactory resolution. This shared understanding of the importance of sound audit and control practices led to an unprecedented level of cooperation among the international regulatory community--in this case, IOSCO, the Basel Committee, the IAIS, the European Commission (EC), the World Bank, and the Financial Stability Forum, which came to be known as the Monitoring Group. Working together, they were able to develop a common position on reforms. This common position served as a basis for dialogue with the leadership of IFAC about establishing a credible independent oversight authority to help enhance the integrity and objectivity of the IAASB's international audit-standards-setting processes. This led to the creation of the new Public Interest Oversight Board of IFAC, which is now busy assuming its new responsibilities. The Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) should, over time, lead to enhanced audit standards and practices around the world. The Financial Stability Forum is pleased to have been a strong supporter of this initiative, and I am happy to see that the PIOB is represented at this roundtable DATE together with the leaders of IFAC and many Monitoring Group representatives. The Financial Stability Forum has taken a close interest in national and international efforts to strengthen confidence in financial reporting frameworks. Stronger and more-convergent national systems bring clear financial stability and efficiency benefits. The forum's efforts have included a focus on the global-standards-setting activities of the IASB on the accounting side and the IAASB on the auditing side. The goal of global standards in both areas will require a high degree of convergence between U.S. and international standards, and efforts toward full commonality are well underway. The forum's interest reflects the strong recognition of its members that the potential financial stability and efficiency benefits are significant: high-quality global accounting standards can lead to enhanced transparency that will improve market discipline and foster stable financial markets. Likewise, external audits performed in accordance with high-quality global audit standards can ensure that financial statements are reliable, transparent, and useful to the marketplace, thus enhancing market confidence. I am sure that we all want to see, over time, a restoration of public confidence in the quality of financial reporting and auditing, and I hope that dialogue--such as that taking place at this roundtable--and the initiatives of standards setters, can lead to standards that are fully understandable to preparers, users, and auditors; that avoid undue complexity and implementation costs; and that truly contribute to transparency. Let me also stress the need to continue to implement approaches that not only improve international accounting and audit standards, but also encourage, through the implementation and enforcement of these standards, an enhancement in actual international accounting and audit practices. However, like any professional undertaking, developing accounting and auditing standards and practices can be complicated, and gaining a shared understanding of the implications for the financial reporting chain and for financial stability can take time. Therefore, I am pleased to see that the Financial Stability Forum, the IASB, and IFAC conducted this roundtable on important financial reporting and auditing matters and that you are taking the time to contribute to the exchange of valuable information on key issues. I hope that this roundtable will continue to foster constructive dialogue among the many key stakeholders represented here and that this type of dialogue will continue after the roundtable has ended.",

                  "Mark W Olson: Basel II Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the DATE Washington Briefing Conference of the Financial Women's Association, Washington, DC, DATE.    Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you DATE about current status of the Basel II capital revisions. As most of you know, the U.S. banking agencies are working with their counterparts on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to develop and implement revisions to the original Basel Capital Accord - also known as Basel I - which was adopted in DATE. As we earnestly work to develop those revisions, it is instructive to recall the environment in which Basel I was created. If we look back at the state of the banking and financial markets in DATE, it is clear that Basel I was a major accomplishment. Many countries had distinct, and considerably different, capital adequacy requirements. Indeed, as banks conducted more and more business across borders, these differences raised significant competitive, if not safety-and-soundness, issues. It soon became clear that supervisors in the industrial countries would benefit from agreement on certain common definitions and minimum standards for regulatory capital. Thus was born the first Basel Capital Accord. Two factors made Basel I particularly noteworthy. First, it contained some common definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets that could be applied across countries. This was no small feat, since, as you know, different jurisdictions often apply a variety of definitions. By agreeing on common definitions, supervisors around the world were more readily able to depend on one another's assessment of capital adequacy without having to determine what the terms meant. Second, Basel I reflected agreement on what constituted a reasonable minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets - the now-famous NUM percent. Although some empirical work went into the derivation of this NUM percent, we should not pretend that this ratio was determined with scientific precision. It did, however, reflect the combined experience and knowledge of all the supervisors around the table. The four risk-weighting brackets, while equally imprecise, were the first efforts to differentiate risk exposures among categories of loan and investment assets. Reasons for developing Basel II In looking back, I believe Basel I, with its common definitions, common agreement on capital minimums, and the initial risk-weighting categories, has served the banking and financial community well. Indeed, there is no reason to replace Basel I for the vast majority of banks here in the United States. But our largest and most complex global banking organizations have, in a sense, outgrown Basel I. On the one hand, the need for Basel II reflects the increased sophistication of risk-management practices and the ways they can be applied to the measurement of capital. At the same time, it also reflects the increased complexity of banking in general, especially at larger institutions. Although many in this audience are very familiar with the provisions of Basel II, let me briefly review them for those who are not. In a general sense, Basel II represents an improved and broadly comparable way to look at risk taking across organizations and over time. It is composed of the now-familiar three pillars: Pillar NUM, minimum capital requirements; Pillar NUM, supervisory review; and Pillar NUM, market discipline. The framework is structured to be much more risk-sensitive than its predecessor; for example, all commercial loans are not lumped into one risk bucket but are differentiated according to certain indicators of risk. Basel II is designed to address the concern that Basel I regulatory capital ratios are no longer good indicators of risk for our largest institutions. Indeed, at our largest institutions, calculating Basel I ratios is sometimes viewed as nothing more than a compliance exercise. The development of sophisticated secondary markets in DATE has allowed banks to make strategic decisions to either retain or sell virtually every category of loan and investment asset. This market advance has had significant implications for the initial Basel effort. Basel I presents an opportunity for banks to retain balance-sheet positions that are of higher risk than their regulatory capital charge and to shed those of lower risk. Using this type of capital arbitrage, banks can game the system in such a way that the resultant Basel I ratio does not have substantial meaning for the public, bank management, or the supervisor. Basel II is intended to close this gap by more directly linking riskiness of assets to their corresponding regulatory capital charge and to reduce, if not eliminate, the incentives to engage in capital arbitrage. Basel II also creates a link between regulatory capital and risk management, especially under the advanced approaches, which are the only ones expected to be applied in the United States. Under these approaches, banks will be required to adopt more-formal, quantitative risk-measurement and management procedures and processes. And, to implement this framework, both bank management and supervisors will need to focus on the integrity and soundness of these procedures and processes, including comprehensive assessments of capital adequacy in relation to the bank's overall risk taking. It is helpful to recall that the quantitative risk-measurement and management procedures and processes that will be required by Basel II are based on practices already in use at DATE's most sophisticated institutions. In other words, the practices in Basel II were not devised by regulators on their own. Admittedly, a certain degree of standardization in these practices was required because Basel II is a minimum regulatory capital framework intended to apply fairly consistently to a wide range of institutions. The new framework should improve supervisors' ability to understand and monitor the risk taking and capital adequacy of large complex banks, thereby allowing regulators to address emerging problems more proactively. The new framework should also enable supervisors to have much more informed and timely conversations with bank management about their risk profiles, based on the new information flows generated. Our hope is that conversations around this common analytical framework will create a common language for risk management. In the United States, we intend to use the framework to determine whether bankers are indeed able to monitor their own risk-taking and capital positions, and we will be placing the onus on bankers to show that they are able to measure, understand, and effectively manage their consolidated risks. minimum It is important to remember that Pillar NUM is supposed to produce a level of regulatory capital and that each institution's actual capital held will vary according to its own risk profile and business mix. Explicit assumptions are built into Pillar NUM, such as the idea that portfolios are well diversified and do not contain geographic or sectoral concentrations. Supervisors must remind institutions that it is initially the bank's job to address any deviations from Pillar NUM assumptions, as well as any additional factors that affect the risk of the individual bank, and to adjust their minimum regulatory capital accordingly. Under Pillar NUM, supervisory authorities, in turn, will review these adjustments by banks and could ask them to take additional steps to ensure that all risks have been addressed. We should also remember that beyond minimum regulatory capital requirements, Pillar NUM requires banks to develop a viable internal process for assessing capital adequacy that contributes to the determination of the amount of capital actually held. Banks should take this requirement seriously. Supervisors will carefully review banks' compliance with this requirement. Basel II also adds a new element of market discipline, as described in Pillar NUM. In the case of our larger organizations, which have become so varied and complex, supervisors have the choice of either using more invasive procedures or relying on market discipline. And market discipline is impossible if counterparties (and rating agencies) do not have better information about banks' risk positions. Markets need accurate information to function effectively. The objective is not to supplant supervision of our larger organizations but to provide information that will enable market participants to serve as an effective complement to supervisors. I would also like to underscore that Basel II is indeed a seminal step in the development of regulatory capital requirements. It is not necessarily the endpoint, but it does represent a substantial step forward - one that we believe will remain in place for DATE to come. Implementation efforts in the United States I would now like to address some of the practical aspects of the implementation of Basel II in the United States. I assume that most of you either heard, or read about the testimony and discussion at DATE hearing before two subcommittees of the House Committee on Financial Services. I will not attempt to paraphrase my colleagues' statements, but I will point out that throughout this process the agencies have stressed the importance of comments from the Congress, the banking industry, and other interested parties. The agencies' reaction to the results of the fourth Quantitative Impact Study - known as QIS4 - shows how seriously we are taking Basel II implementation. The interagency statement issued on DATE indicated clearly, I believe, that results from QIS4 were more widely dispersed and showed a larger overall drop in capital than the agencies had expected. This was the impetus for deciding to delay the notice of proposed rulemaking for Basel II. We now have to determine whether these results arose from actual differences in risk among respondents, differences in stages of preparation (including data limitations) among respondents, limits of the QIS4 exercise, or a possible need for adjustments to the Basel framework itself. Staff at the agencies are working together to analyze the QIS4 results and in some cases are talking to banks about their submissions. Analyzing the data used in QIS4 is vitally important, because ultimately the success of Basel II will depend on the quantity and quality of data that banks have to use as inputs to the framework. From the Federal Reserve's perspective, delving into the results of QIS4 is an appropriate response by the agencies. But we should also acknowledge that this follow-up work has its limits. We can go only so far with the data given to us. We must recognize that banks - understandably - might not yet have their data systems ready to develop Basel II risk parameters and that it might take more time before we see Basel II parameters based on truly credible systems. But, in our view, that is not a reason to stop working. Indeed, one of the most important aspects of Basel II pertains to improved risk management, and having banks move forward in that area can only bring benefits. Of course, we support the established protocols and procedures for implementing domestic rules in the United States, which will include additional comment periods and opportunity for the banking industry, Congress, and others to express their views, and we are in favor of starting that part of the process as soon as possible. The information we now have points to the need to keep working; however, if new information indicates that changes need to be made or that additional pauses would be prudent, we will of course respond appropriately. Since the agencies remain committed to Basel II, we must give institutions as much information as possible to help them with their preparations. The agencies have sought to provide helpful information to institutions as soon as it becomes available - for example the draft supervisory guidance documents that are now under development. So far, the agencies have issued draft guidance for the advanced measurement approaches for operational risk and certain parts of the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk. Additional draft guidance is expected to be issued for public comment either along with or soon after the notice of proposed rulemaking is released. From the beginning, we intended this guidance to further clarify supervisory expectations for implementation of Basel II in the United States, and it is directed at bankers as well as at supervisors. We believe that by outlining what supervisors would expect, the proposed guidance gives banks a far better understanding of how to upgrade their systems, modify their procedures, and strengthen their controls in anticipation of eventual adoption of Basel II. Our hope is that, by clearly communicating expectations, we are giving both bankers and our own examiners sufficient time to prepare for the new framework. One vital element of our preparation for implementation has been our dialogue with the banking industry. At many stages along the way, banking organizations - both internationally and domestically - have expressed their concerns about certain aspects of Basel II. When credible evidence and compelling arguments have shown that those concerns are well founded, the agencies and the Basel Committee have modified the proposal. For example, global regulators heard the industry's call for addressing only unexpected loss in the framework, and the approach to securitization was substantially altered on the basis of comments received. Supervisors and the industry need to maintain an ongoing dialogue about Basel II, since it is such a complex and multifaceted project. Issues range from very technical questions about parameter values to broad concerns about how the framework will be implemented across countries. We hope it is clear that we are being attentive to the full range of these concerns and will continue to be as the industry raises additional concerns along the way. The continued emphasis on dialogue is even more important because a few important elements of the framework are still considered works in process. For example, the Basel framework issued DATE did not define the exact manner in which institutions should calculate their estimates of loss given default (LGD) based on periods of economic downturn. The Basel member countries have commissioned a subgroup to study this issue, recommend a way to add clarity to the concept of downturn or \"stress\" LGDs, and provide guidance to the industry. The Basel Committee has also recently issued a consultative paper on certain trading-related exposures and double-default effects, stemming from the work of a joint group formed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. We are acutely aware that our continuing work on these issues is complicating banks' preparations somewhat. But since these issues are so critical, we have to take the extra time to find the right solutions. And we need the help of the industry to do so. Competitive effects of Basel II Before I close, I would like to say a few words about the potential competitive effects of Basel II. At the Federal Reserve, we are particularly interested in effects that Basel II could have on banking markets, particularly ones that could distort existing markets that work well. In that vein, we have published several white papers analyzing the potential impact on specific aspects of banking, such as small-business lending, mortgage lending, and mergers and acquisitions. A paper on credit cards is forthcoming. While the conclusions of the papers published so far do not point to broad disruptions in existing banking markets as a result of Basel II, we do acknowledge that certain participants could be affected, especially in the small-business and residential-mortgage credit markets. In part to address these concerns, but also to conduct overdue routine updates to existing regulatory capital rules, the agencies also plan to propose several modifications to the current rules that most banks in the United States will continue to follow, since Basel II is expected to apply to only a handful of institutions. The agencies understand that outside parties will likely want to see the notice of proposed rulemaking for Basel II and the relevant proposals for amending current rules alongside one another for comparison's sake. Conclusion Broadly speaking, in developing Basel II we are striving to establish higher standards for internal risk management at banking organizations, including capital adequacy, and to improve both the supervisors' and the public's understanding of banks' risk taking and risk management. Over DATE, major banking organizations have become ever larger and more complex, while some national financial systems have become more concentrated. Against this backdrop, assessing the overall risk and capital adequacy of the largest banks has become not only increasingly difficult for supervisors, the public, and bank management, but also critical for national authorities. If you believe, as I do, that Basel I was one of the most important advances in international bank supervision, then I hope you also accept that market changes and increased sophistication in risk-management techniques require that we now update that initial framework. A fundamental premise of Basel II is that, for these major banks, neither supervisory nor market discipline can be effective unless banks' own systems can be depended on to measure and manage risk taking and capital adequacy. Basel II is intended to provide both a framework and incentives for achieving these ends. It is useful to keep in mind that as supervisors we are seeking to apply a new set of rules to private, profit-seeking businesses and are trying to achieve the goals of Basel II in a manner consistent with achieving safety and soundness in a market economy. For example, we want to be relatively certain that the required capital levels for business lines (and, of course, for the bank as a whole) are in line with the underlying risks, and we need to have a certain degree of confidence in the capital numbers for each bank. We also want banks to target their investments where they can have the greatest positive impact on risk measurement and management. In other words, we are not looking for large expenditures in areas for which the benefits will not be material. Finally, we would like to see some comparability across banks, at least in their estimation of the inputs for Basel II, but at the same time offer a certain degree of flexibility to reduce burden on the banks and allow them to retain their own styles of risk management. Admittedly, navigating between consistency and flexibility is an art, but our experience tells us that it is achievable when all parties work together.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: The Basel II Accord and House Resolution NUM Testimony of Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology and the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington, DATE.    Chairman Bachus, Chairman Pryce, and members of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology: It is a pleasure to join my colleagues from the other banking agencies to discuss the current status of Basel II in this country, as well as the Federal Reserve's views on DATE. The continued discussion among the Congress and the regulators - and, of course, the banking industry and other members of the public - is critical to the final implementation of the new capital accord. The focus of recent attention has been the agencies' announcement that they will delay the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for Basel II, originally scheduled for DATE. In my remarks DATE, I will discuss the reasons for the delay and the Board's views regarding the timetable for implementation of Basel II in this country. But, first, I believe it may be useful to remind the members of the subcommittees why the agencies thought it wise to explore and then develop a modernization of the current capital accord; those factors have become, if anything, more important than they were when we began the process. Our banking system is becoming more concentrated, with a number of very large entities operating across multiple business lines and national boundaries, each entity with positions and exposures that are both complicated and difficult for third parties to understand. These entities have outgrown the current regulatory capital regime, which is still adequate for most banks. But the current rules simply cannot keep up with the complex business of the global banking organizations toward which Basel II and its infrastructure prerequisites are directed. These organizations represent significant risks to the financial system should they develop substantial problems in a period of stress. Basel II offers the opportunity to work with these large entities to develop quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management systems that can both measure their risk more accurately and become the basis for more risk-focused capital requirements and prudential supervision. We would also require, as part of the Basel II approach, more public disclosures to improve market discipline and supplement supervisory efforts. Many internationally active U.S. banks apparently agree that we should work toward Basel II. Indeed, we and the industry have already seen some benefits from work on Basel II implementation in that market participants and bank supervisors have developed a common language for inputs into risk-management processes. DATE, twenty-six banking organizations provided us with internal measures of credit risk as part of the fourth quantitative impact study, or QIS4. The agencies have now reviewed the risk parameter estimates provided and are discussing with individual participants their approaches to developing the required inputs. These discussions, which are ongoing, have significantly changed some of the data provided, and some modifications are still coming in. Nonetheless, even with these revisions, two conclusions are already clear. First, the dispersion among the banks in their estimates of the key parameters that would be used to calculate Basel II capital requirements was quite wide - much wider than expected. Second, the implied reductions in minimum regulatory capital were often substantial - far more than previous quantitative impact studies, both here and abroad, had suggested. As responsible and prudent regulators, we believe it is appropriate to improve our understanding of these results and to see whether changes might be needed in our proposals. From the outset of our participation in the development of Basel II, the U.S. agencies have clearly and consistently stated that the final adoption of the new capital rules in the United States would occur only after (NUM) we had reviewed all public comments and incorporated any needed adjustments to address legitimate concerns, and (NUM) we were satisfied that Basel II was consistent with safe and sound banking in this country. Throughout this process we have stressed that, should we become concerned about the level of overall capital in the banking system or the capital results for individual portfolios, we would seek to modify the framework, including possibly recalibrating the regulatory capital formulas that translate an individual bank's risk parameters into required capital. The agencies' current review and study is consistent with our historical position at Basel. All of the agencies want to have a better understanding of QIS4 data and results. Does the dispersion reflect different risk profiles? Different model assumptions? Different estimates of risk for the same kind of asset? Different kinds of internal rating systems with some looking \"through the cycle\" and others being \"point in time\"? Different stages of institutions' implementation efforts? Limitations of current data bases? Some other factor? We hope that further analysis and discussion with respondents can provide some answers to such questions. All the agencies believed that the prudent approach was to delay the NPR to gain better understanding of the reasons for the unexpected results. Still, this decision presents the U.S. banking agencies with a dilemma. There is good reason to delay the NPR and related supervisory guidance, but those very documents are needed to provide more complete blueprints for what banks will need in terms of the databases and systems to implement Basel II. We are not saying that these large entities DATE have inadequate risk-management systems. Rather, they do not yet have the systems for producing Basel II inputs that meet the standards set forth in the Basel II proposal. Until the banking organizations have the NPR, many just will not be able to provide us the inputs we need to assess how banks would operate under Basel II. The dilemma can be solved only by first issuing the NPR. But, we must then have a prudent and flexible way to make adjustments should the resultant data produce results that we, as supervisors, are not comfortable with. The plans developed before the delay in the NPR offer just such an opportunity. Under those plans, institutions required or planning to move to Basel II would, after the adoption of a final rule, decide when to start their parallel run - with the first opportunity in DATE. During the required parallel run, each bank would continue to calculate its required capital under the current capital regime and simultaneously calculate its Basel II capital statistics for review by its primary supervisor. When the supervisor believes that the bank has produced DATE of credible Basel II estimates, the bank would be able to enter a minimum DATE transition run, the earliest in DATE under these plans. During this transition run, the bank would be under Basel II capital rules, but it could not reduce its capital below NUM percent of what the current capital rules would require in DATE or below NUM percent in DATE. The length of either the parallel run or the transition run could be extended if the primary supervisor had doubts about the bank's Basel II system or the prudence of the resulting minimum regulatory capital level. Only after a minimum DATE transition run and only if its primary supervisor had no objection could a U.S. bank operate fully under Basel II capital rules. This phase-in plan has been designed to ensure that bank inputs are reasonable and consistent with sound risk-management practices and that supervisors are comfortable with the safety and soundness of Basel II before it goes fully \"live\" in the United States. Please note that only when we get into the parallel run period will the agencies be able to accurately assess the aggregate capital effects as well as the effects on individual institutions from the new accord. Only then will banks' systems provide risk-parameter inputs that comport with the operational requirements of Basel II, and only then can the U.S. authorities be confident that the resultant capital calculations are reliable estimates of what will happen when Basel II is fully implemented. Such data would be far superior to those obtained through the four QIS exercises that we have conducted to date, which, as I have noted, have been carried out by banks on a best-efforts basis using systems that do not yet meet the standards required under Basel II. Once we have data from the parallel run period, the agencies can then consider the need, if any, for a recalibration of the Basel II parameters or other actions to ensure more-accurate risk sensitivity and a prudent level of overall capital. This deliberate process provides multiple safeguards to help the agencies move to the final adoption of the new framework in the United States only when doing so is clearly appropriate. In other words, our implementation strategy has been designed to be both prudent and flexible enough to move banks from Basel I to Basel II as their own systems mature and they can provide reasonably accurate assessments of their credit and operational risks. The agencies' analysis of and reaction to QIS4 results show how those safeguards work: We saw results that gave us concern, and so we are investigating further before we go to the next stage. Additional, future safeguards - such as the NPR process and the minimum DATE parallel run and the minimum DATE transition period, with options to extend either - will also ensure ample opportunity to recalibrate or seek other adjustments if necessary. But, for now, we believe that after a certain point, further analysis of QIS4 is likely to reap little or no additional benefit. We should, of course, try to learn what we can from these data and particularly look for indications of the need to modify the Basel II proposal where necessary. However, as soon as we have learned what we can, we should promptly return to the development of the joint NPR and related supervisory guidance. These documents are essential so that core and opt-in banks can continue to develop the databases and systems that they would need to operate under the Basel II capital rules and that would provide more-accurate risk parameter estimates than those in QIS4. Recall that there have already been three rounds of U.S. public comments on the Basel II consultative papers DATE; an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) in DATE; and numerous agency discussions with congressional committees, banking groups, and individual banks. All have resulted in significant modifications to the proposal. Once published, the NPR and the supervisory guidance will once more elicit comments that could result in further revisions. Particularly given its delayed issuance, the NPR must solicit feedback from core and potential opt-in banks as to whether the current timeline for implementing Basel II in this country needs to be delayed or can be retained. Looking forward, I agree with my colleagues at this table that it is prudent to delay the NPR in order to see what we can learn from further review of QIS4 data, recognizing at the outset that final answers will not be forthcoming because the requisite databases and risk-management systems are not yet in place. I hope that we can return to the NPR before DATE, present it to the Office of Management and Budget for its review, as our OCC and OTS colleagues must do, and release the NPR in DATE. With such a schedule, one might hope that the parallel running period, currently scheduled for DATE, need not be delayed. But, as I noted earlier, it is important for the agencies to get feedback on this issue during the NPR comment period. The views of banking organizations will provide critical insights into the feasibility of the scheduled DATE start date for the transition run. Once we have the views of the banking organizations, the agencies will be in a better position to reach a consensus on the timeline. Basel II has the potential to be an important supervisory step forward. The Basel I framework is being arbitraged aggressively and provides us with less and less reliable measures on which to base a regulatory capital requirement for our largest and most complex banking organizations. Moreover, banks have spent tens of millions of dollars preparing for the U.S. implementation of Basel II and have contracts for further investment. They are awaiting the NPR, the guidance, and the final rules. Their global competitors are proceeding, and U.S. banks will be eager to avoid being placed at a competitive disadvantage. I might add that, as supervisors, we believe that the core risk-measurement and risk-management improvements contained in Basel II are appropriate, regardless of how the future accord is finally structured and calibrated. So it is, in our view, a good idea for banks to continue their current trajectory of making risk-management investments. While the regulatory capital requirements ultimately produced by Basel II would be, we believe, considerably more risk sensitive than the current capital regime, importantly this is not the only capital regulation under which U.S. institutions would operate. Over DATE, the Congress, as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regime, defined a critically undercapitalized insured depository institution by reference to a minimum tangible-equity-to-asset requirement, a leverage ratio. The agencies have also used other leverage ratios to define other PCA capital categories because experience has suggested that there is no substitute for an adequate equity-to-asset ratio, especially for entities that face the moral hazard that accompanies the safety net. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), responsible to the Congress for the management of the critical deposit insurance portion of the safety net, has underlined the importance of that minimum leverage ratio and PCA as part of a prudent supervisory regime. The Federal Reserve concurs in the FDIC's view. We need, for reasons I have given, the risk-measurement and risk-management infrastructure and risk sensitivity of Basel II; but we also need the supplementary assurance of a minimum equity base. The market and the rating agencies will continue to require exactly that kind of base, and a regulatory minimum is prudentially desirable. Even though the market and the rating agencies, not to mention bank management, will still require banking organizations to carry capital considerably above regulatory minimums, many of the thousands of depository institutions that will remain under the current capital rules are concerned about the impact of Basel II on their businesses. This concern is often voiced as a general disquiet about broad competitive feedbacks but also about competitive implications in specific markets. The Federal Reserve has published a series of research papers investigating such concerns voiced in public comments on the previous ANPR on Basel II. These studies have indeed suggested that there are potential effects that should be addressed in the small business and residential mortgage markets. For this reason, as well as to continue to modernize the current capital regime, the agencies are developing, simultaneously with the Basel II proposal, a proposal to revise the current capital rules for non-Basel II banks to make those rules more risk sensitive and to blunt any unintended harm that Basel II might impose on non-adopters. Our intention is to keep these proposed changes simple to minimize any costs imposed on the many non-adopters. We plan to issue these proposals for public comment concurrently with or soon after the NPR on Basel II, to allow the banking community to comment on a combined package of proposed changes. However, these revised Basel I rules would not be an adequate substitute for the necessary capital reforms for the large, complex, global banks operating in this country because they would not provide the incentives for banks to adopt the more-sophisticated risk-measurement and risk-management techniques envisioned by the Basel II proposal. Chairman Bachus and Chairman Pryce, I would also like to present the Federal Reserve's views on DATE, a bill setting up a committee of the four banking and thrift regulators to reach a common U.S. position on Basel issues and authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury, as its chairman, to determine a common position on any issue about which the regulators could not agree. The Federal Reserve believes that the bill does not fully reflect the existing process used by the four agencies to develop and modify Basel II and we would counsel that Congress not enact it. Staff members of the four agencies have held frequent and comprehensive discussions about Basel II throughout the process. Certainly, the agencies have sometimes disagreed on specific issues, and we will sometimes disagree in the future. But we have in the past been able to find a common position that we can all support at Basel, and we will do so in the future. The salient fact is that any one of us has a veto over the entire proposal because we all realize that different rules cannot be applied to similarly situated insured depository institutions. That fact forces us to develop consensus positions on which all of us can agree. We have done so in the past because we understand that if the agencies cannot reach a collective agreement at Basel, the Basel II reforms will not be implemented in the United States while they go forward in the rest of the world. Communication, compromise, and comity are the prerequisites for agreement among the agencies. Further, the ability of the U.S. agencies to negotiate effectively at Basel would be severely constrained if our foreign counterparties knew that we had to return to a committee before we could agree. The formalized \"decision by committee\" approach of DATE would not advance U.S. interests in the complex and dynamic Basel negotiation process. The U.S. banking agencies need to preserve our current flexibility to respond to Basel issues if we are to develop a set of capital rules that are useful and productive for U.S. banks and thrifts. Moreover, it is possible that the agencies are more likely to implement effectively an agreement that they helped shape than they would be one that was imposed on them and for which they did not understand fully the rationale. While we urge the Congress not to move forward on this bill, we look forward to keeping Congress fully informed as the Basel process continues. I will be pleased to answer your questions.",

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Risk management and Basel II Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston AMA Conference, Boston, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    I am delighted to be here DATE at this impressive conference. I thank my hosts, President Rosengren and his staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, for the invitation. I also thank President Rosengren for providing such interesting and informative introductory remarks. Over DATE, you will be having a number of discussions on specific aspects of operational risk and the advanced measurements approaches (AMA) for calculating riskbased capital requirements under Basel II. Therefore, I can probably best contribute to this conference by offering a broader perspective about risk management and Basel II, using examples from the field of operational risk management. I will discuss the implementation of Basel II, including enhancements to the framework being undertaken by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in light of recent market events, as well as a proposal to implement in the United States a less complex version of the Basel II framework, known as the standardized approach. Background I believe focusing on risk management DATE is certainly topical, given some of the risk management challenges that financial institutions have faced over DATE. Recent market events have shown that a number of institutions have not maintained satisfactory risk management practices; however, we also can point to many examples of sound risk management practices during the recent disruptions.NUM Individual institutions are responsible for maintaining sound risk management practices. But supervisors, of course, also have a role to play both in promoting effective risk management and offering incentives for bankers to make improvements to their practices. There are a number of methods supervisors use to that end - some informal, some formal - including speeches, one-on-one discussions, supervisory guidance, onsite examinations, formal supervisory actions, and regulations. One substantial initiative that seeks to improve risk management practices at banking organizations is Basel II. Importance of Basel II As you all know, banking activities must be supported by both sound risk management and strong capital levels. For example, even where robust internal controls are in place, the potential for losses from fraud can never be fully eliminated, meaning that institutions need to hold sufficient capital to offset unexpected losses. Determining the right level of capital to hold for fraud and other elements of operational risk is not necessarily easy, as many of you here can attest. But the AMA is designed to make that determination more risk sensitive and more accurate. In this manner, Basel II represents a major step forward in banking regulation. While the existing Basel I capital regime was a significant advance when introduced in DATE, it has become outdated for large, internationally active banking organizations. Retaining Basel I for these institutions would have widened the gap between their regulatory capital requirements and their actual risk profiles. That is one reason why the Federal Reserve supports Basel II so strongly. With regard to credit risk, the advanced approaches of Basel II improve regulatory capital measures by requiring banks to distinguish among the credit quality of individual borrowers. Generally speaking, banks holding riskier credit exposures are required to hold more capital. Similarly, the AMA framework requires a more systematic approach for assessing the operational risk to which a bank is exposed and ties an explicit regulatory risk-based capital requirement to these exposures. Under Basel I, this charge was indirect and embedded in credit and market risk measures. In contrast, under the AMA, banks with higher levels of operational risk - such as those more heavily involved than others in activities that have elevated loss potential from fraud, business disruption, or systems failure - generally should have higher capital requirements. By establishing a much more refined approach that requires banks to hold capital commensurate with the actual risks of their exposures and activities, Basel II should lead institutions to make better decisions about assuming, retaining, and mitigating risks. Not only does Basel II establish more risk-sensitive and meaningful regulatory capital requirements, it also encourages ongoing improvements in banks' risk management practices. The U.S. final rule for Basel II includes extensive system and process requirements and U.S. supervisors have high standards for banks seeking to qualify. One reason for such high standards is that the framework will only function as intended if Basel II banks have solid risk management infrastructures and robust quantification methods on which to base capital requirements. Another reason for such high standards is that the risk management improvements in Basel II offer broader safety and soundness benefits, beyond those associated with capital requirements. Risk management and the AMA There are strong linkages between the AMA and supervisory expectations for sound management of operational risk. The AMA builds upon the longtime best practices of banks to develop techniques for identifying, measuring, and attributing capital for operational risk. I commend those of you here DATE who have made strides in improving operational risk management, and heartily encourage you to maintain your efforts. Supervisors have been working actively with bankers to improve operational risk management and help bankers move toward qualification under AMA. A good example is the research and analysis conducted by my colleagues here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston: their useful papers have covered such topics as estimating operational risk loss distributions, evaluating various measurement techniques, and analyzing the reputational impact of operational risk losses. Supervisors have also conducted a series of loss-data collection exercises in which many of you have participated. More generally, I think supervisory attention on operational risk management has provided support to risk managers striving to improve practices within their organizations. The AMA has specific qualification requirements that are intended to bring about risk management improvements. For example, institutions are required to categorize operational risk losses by event type, which promotes identification of the underlying risk drivers of each category. The AMA also requires consistent comprehensive operational risk capture, which promotes an enterprise-wide assessment across all business units within an entire organization. Moreover, qualifying for the AMA requires strong senior management and board oversight of the entire process. In designing AMA requirements, supervisors decided against creating a mandated, standard treatment and instead allowed for considerable flexibility. Allowing more flexibility lets banks create an AMA reflective of their organization, and it promotes innovation in AMA approaches. But that flexibility makes banks more responsible for creating a solid and robust process rather than simply providing inputs to a supervisory-determined formula. Operational risk management is a relatively new field, and a number of challenges remain, such as collecting sufficient and relevant data and developing appropriate modeling techniques to capture low probability events of high severity. Naturally, validating the techniques used in the AMA is also very important, as with any quantitative models. Pillar NUM and Pillar NUM While Pillar NUM minimum capital requirements are very important, people sometimes forget that Basel II has three pillars of equal significance. Under Pillar NUM, banks are required to have an internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), subject to rigorous supervisory review. The bank's ICAAP should ensure that the bank is holding enough overall capital to support its entire risk profile, and it should provide a cushion against the potential impact of periods of financial or economic stress. In its ICAAP, for example, an institution may choose a solvency standard for overall capital adequacy that is higher than the NUM percent implied by the AMA - for example, a solvency standard of NUM or NUM associated with a certain credit rating. As most of you know, estimating capital needs in the tail of a loss distribution becomes more and more difficult the farther out one goes, so simply \"scaling\" the AMA measure will likely not suffice for truly assessing capital adequacy against a higher solvency standard. More broadly, one of the supervisory expectations surrounding the ICAAP is that institutions should understand the limitations of models and conduct stress testing and scenario analysis to provide greater information about potential losses and capital needs. Even good models have their limits - such as incomplete data or assumptions that have not been tested across business cycles - and need to be supported by more qualitative measures and sound judgment. Put another way, Pillar NUM is not just about using \"one number,\" but requires institutions to develop a robust process to evaluate the full range of potentially adverse outcomes that could affect capital adequacy. This process certainly includes considering the potential for operational risk losses becoming correlated with losses in other risk areas. Recent events provide ample evidence that underestimating the potential for concurrent losses in multiple risk areas can put pressure on capital levels. Pillar NUM plays an important role in providing greater information on banks' risk profiles and their ability to manage them. In addition to disclosing their capital requirements for operational risk under the AMA, banks will have to provide a description of their AMA process, including their measurement approaches and relevant internal and external factors considered. They will also have to provide information about the use of insurance to mitigate operational risk. As a strong believer in market discipline and the importance of information in market transactions, I believe Pillar NUM will improve bank disclosures about risk profiles and enhance discussions between bankers and market participants about risk-management practices. Next steps with Basel II implementation In the United States, Basel II has been an official regulation for DATE. But the full implementation process will take time. While I believe that expeditious application of Basel II will have significant benefits, it is of the utmost importance that the implementation be undertaken thoughtfully and deliberately. As you know, following a successful DATE parallel run, a banking organization would have to progress through three transitional periods - each lasting DATE being able to fully implement Basel II. A banking organization would need approval from its primary federal supervisor to move into each of the three transition periods. Of course, we recognize the substantial work that bankers have undertaken over DATE to prepare themselves for Basel II, and we think that preparation will pay off. Thus, before setting a parallel run target start date, we strongly recommend that banks conduct a sober and frank self-appraisal of their current state as well as their ability to meet requirements of the final rule. Systems development can take time, for example, and it is important to make sure that these systems function appropriately. As stated in the final rule, and as the U.S. agencies articulated DATE, a key instrument in the qualification process is a bank's implementation plan. This written implementation plan, approved by a bank's full board of directors, is a detailed and tangible representation of how the bank complies, or intends to comply, with the rule's qualification requirements. Our hope is to provide a bit more information in DATE or so about our expectations for these plans, so I will only provide high-level comments here. One important part of a credible implementation plan is a thorough assessment of how the bank intends to address the gaps it has identified between its existing practices and the qualification requirements set forth in the rule for the advanced approaches that cover all consolidated subsidiaries. The implementation plan also must include objective, measurable milestones - including delivery dates - and a target date when the bank expects its advanced approaches to be fully operational. The bank must establish and maintain a sound, comprehensive planning and governance process to oversee implementation efforts, and it must demonstrate to the full satisfaction of its supervisor that it meets the qualification requirements. Because the implementation plan (including the gap analysis) is the only requirement to enter parallel run, the agencies have high expectations for its overall quality and the reasonableness of the approach taken by the banks in assessing their current state. The large, internationally active banks subject to the final rule on a mandatory basis - the core banks - have until DATE to adopt an implementation plan and have it approved by their board of directors. This deadline for submission of plans by core banks is intended to ensure that the board of directors will provide the necessary resources and oversight and prevent delays in implementation efforts. Of course, banks may always submit their plans earlier. Once they have adopted an implementation plan, banks have ample time to fully meet the qualification requirements, since the final rule allows a bank DATE before it would have to exit parallel run and enter the first transition period. As with all things, however, waiting until the last possible moment leaves little margin for error. Again, as supervisors, we understand that banks face challenges in implementing Basel II, and we stand ready to assist bankers as they work to meet the high standards we expect. For one, we have already engaged in a number of discussions with bankers to address their questions on certain aspects of the final rule. In that effort, supervisory staffs of all the U.S. agencies are working together to ensure that we give consistent messages to bankers, and we intend to maintain such cooperation among the agencies throughout the implementation process. We have also been preparing our examiners to assess banks' practices during the qualification process. In this manner, we have been working to ensure that qualification is done thoroughly, fairly, and consistently. Enhancements to the Basel II framework One of the substantial benefits of the Basel II framework is its overall flexibility and adaptability to new practices, instruments, and circumstances. That is, Basel II provides a robust structure within which to integrate new information and enhanced risk management practices as needed. As such, the Basel II framework is well suited to address some of the current challenges seen with the current Basel I framework. For example, the new framework's credit risk capital charges for mortgages vary with the underlying riskiness of the exposures unlike Basel I. Basel II also takes into account off-balance sheet exposures much better than the Basel I framework. Just as lessons learned from recent events can help bankers improve risk management practices, they can also help supervisors further increase the effectiveness of the Basel II framework. Indeed, members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recently announced plans to strengthen the resiliency of the framework based on the lessons we have learned over DATE. The Basel Committee's plans to enhance aspects of Basel II are entirely consistent with what we have done in the past with regulatory capital rules upon receiving new information and represent good supervisory practice. These proposals to enhance the resiliency of the Basel II framework are fully consistent with one of its key objectives - improving risk management - and should in no way interfere with institutions' efforts to meet the process and system requirements in the U.S. final rule. The Basel Committee's enhancements, which it outlined in an DATE press release,NUM are intended to improve Basel II's ability to make the banking system more resilient to financial shocks. For one, the Committee will revise the framework to establish higher capital requirements for certain complex structured credit products, such as so-called \"resecuritizations\" or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) of asset-backed securities, which have been the source of many losses during the recent market disturbances. There are also plans to strengthen the capital treatment of liquidity facilities extended by banks to support off-balance sheet vehicles such as asset-backed commercial paper conduits. Furthermore, the Committee will strengthen the capital requirements in the trading book, given the large growth in trading-book assets and the wide range of instruments held there, some of them quite complex and less liquid. The current value-at-risk based treatment for assessing capital for trading book risk is limited in its ability to capture extraordinary events that can affect many complex and less liquid exposures. The Committee is working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on an interim treatment for certain instruments held in the trading book, such as complex securitizations, and will conduct further analysis to determine a suitable longer-term approach. The Committee plans to issue Pillar NUM guidance in a number of areas to help strengthen banks' practices and help them better prepare for financial shocks that could affect capital adequacy. Areas under consideration include proper asssessment of the risks from offbalance sheet exposures and securitizations, as well as the need to address reputational risk and apply proper stress testing. These efforts relating to Pillar NUM are certainly in line with my earlier comments that bankers must understand the limitations of their more formal risk models, and think creatively to ensure that they have captured all risks and addressed them appropriately. Going forward, the Committee will monitor Basel II minimum requirements and capital buffers to evaluate their appropriateness. It will also assess banks' internal capital management processes and associated risk management practices. This oversight will be particularly important given some of the breakdowns in risk management at institutions over DATE and the associated pressures on capital ratios. The Committee is also working to promote better disclosures by banking organizations under Pillar NUM. Standardized approach in the United States As a final point, I would like to mention that U.S. agencies plan, fairly soon, to publish for public comment a set of proposed rules that would provide an optional capital framework - known as the standardized approach - for those banks not subject to the advanced approaches of Basel II. The proposed standardized approach would help increase risk sensitivity and foster competitive equity. Since we have not yet formally issued the proposed rules for public comment, I will provide just a brief overview on aspects of the proposal that the agencies have already discussed publicly. The proposed U.S. standardized approach will be based on the approach of the same name in the international Basel II framework, modified in some areas to suit the U.S. banking system. The standardized approach would enhance risk sensitivity by increasing the number of risk-weight categories to which a bank would assign credit exposures. It also would increase capital requirements for certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as liquidity commitments, and allow for broader recognition of credit risk mitigants, such as collateral and guarantees. In addition, the approach will include a specific capital requirement for operational risk. Banks not required to adopt the Basel II advanced approaches are facing a choice about whether to opt-in to them. Some of these banks may be sophisticated institutions that exhibit sound risk management, but they might not wish to undertake the extensive effort to meet the advanced approaches of Basel II. The agencies recognize that such institutions should be afforded an alternative to more-risk-sensitive capital requirements, one not as complex as the advanced approaches. Therefore, the proposal is being developed as an optional riskbased capital framework for all banking organizations not required to adopt the Basel II advanced approaches. We plan to retain our existing Basel I-based regulatory capital framework for those banks that would prefer to remain under that regime. I encourage all interested parties to review and comment on this proposal once it has been issued. We are keenly aware of the need for capital requirements to make sense from a standpoint that considers safety, soundness, and competitiveness; we recognize that a onesize-fits-all approach is probably not the best for our banking system, in light of our wide range of institutions. We remain sensitive to the principle that if we have multiple regulatory capital frameworks they must work together to support the safety and soundness of our entire banking system without artificially creating competitive inequalities. Conclusion My remarks DATE have focused on the risk management aspects of Basel II, with particular emphasis on operational risk. Events of DATE have shown that institutions should never let their guard down when it comes to risk management. Even though most of the highprofile losses during DATE have - so far - stemmed from market and credit risks, one should not, therefore, assume that less attention should be paid to operational risk management. The Basel II capital framework is a positive step forward through its combination of more risk-sensitive capital requirements with strong incentives for improved risk management. In this manner, we expect Basel II to make the U.S. banking industry more resilient in the face of future financial turbulence and generally more safe and sound.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Financial supervision issues Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Securities Industry Association Annual Meeting, Boca Raton, Florida, DATE.    I want to thank you for the invitation to speak at this DATE meeting of the Securities Industry Association (SIA). The financial services industry continues to evolve to meet the challenges posed by mergers, new financial instruments, and changing regulatory frameworks. The Federal Reserve Board, as the umbrella supervisor of financial holding companies, has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness and relevance of regulation and supervision in this changing environment. Some of the issues that we have been dealing with recently are of mutual concern to both broker-dealers and commercial bankers - albeit they may represent different sides of the coin. Others involve reconciling the differing perspectives and regulatory environments of investment firms and commercial banks around similar financial products and activities in the wake of financial conglomeration. DATE I would like to bring you up-to-date on three such issues, as well as highlight some aspects of the Federal Reserve's proposed anti-tying guidelines. In all of these areas, I encourage your participation as we work toward new regulatory guidance. Accounting for securities The first supervisory issue I would like to discuss involves accounting for investment securities. The recent accounting guidance, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, or EITF NUM-NUM, has raised serious questions about accounting for investments that are held in available-for-sale portfolios. As many of you are aware, when the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) came to its consensus DATE, it was not intending to dramatically change accounting practices for debt securities. But in DATE, the public accounting firms began interpreting the guidance very differently. Specifically, if a security was sold from the available-for-sale investment portfolio at a loss, the new interpretation called into question the facts and circumstances that should be used to determine if the remaining portfolio should be viewed as \"other than temporarily impaired,\" and thereby marked down to the lower of cost or market through earnings (LOCOM). At the Federal Reserve, we were concerned about the interpretation since most banks use their available-for-sale portfolio to manage their net interest margin on longer-term, fixed-rate deposits and funding. A LOCOM accounting model applied to such instruments is not consistent with this important management function. For asset-liability management purposes, historical cost accounting better reflects the use of the available-for-sale portfolio to hedge this type of interest rate risk. We have always expected banks to regularly review the fair values of all their securities. But the concept of \"tainting\" due to realized losses from the available-for-sale portfolio had not been widely applied in such a narrow way. I commend FASB for listening to questions raised by preparers, auditors, and bank regulators and for agreeing to defer the effective date of the impairment guidance in this interpretation. FASB has also issued some implementation guidance, and its comment period ran until DATE. To be sure, the fixed-income research groups of a number of SIA members have played an important role in educating their commercial bank customers on the issues surrounding EITF NUM-NUM over DATE. However, more work may be needed and I would encourage you to closely monitor FASB's deliberations. Pay particular attention to the facts and circumstances that should be considered. Note that the guidance allows sales of available-for-sale securities at a loss for the same reasons sales of held-to-maturity securities are permitted without tainting the remaining portfolio. For example, mergers or changes in regulatory capital justify untainted sales. The guidance also permits sales for unexpected and significant changes in liquidity needs or for increases in interest rates. In practice, EITF NUM-NUM should make all organizations that have available-for-sale securities review their procedures for identifying impairment. Clearly, investors should continue to monitor for credit downgrades and changes in prepayment speeds, especially for interest-only strips and mortgage-backed securities booked at a premium. But the trigger for recognizing impairments for changes in interest rates under EITF NUM-NUM would no longer be an intent to sell, but rather whether the investor no longer intends to hold the security until fair value recovers to its amortized cost. Also note that the disclosure aspects of EITF NUM-NUM do apply to DATE financial statements. The major change is separate disclosure of securities whose fair value is below carrying cost. Organizations must now disclose separately the amount of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for DATE, and in the narrative discuss why the loss has not yet been recognized. As dealers in investment securities for banks and other investors, your organizations should be aware of the importance of remaining informed about emerging accounting interpretations that deal with longaccepted practices - not only in the context of providing products and services to your customers, but also in your own bank-like entities that may be affected as investors. Regulatory capital issues Let me now move on to some accounting issues that relate broadly to the new capital framework for the largest U.S.-based financial institutions, including broker-dealers who wish to have consolidated supervision for purposes of meeting European Union requirements. In general, this entails brokerdealer implementation of Basel II capital requirements. As you know, the Basel II effort to revise bank risk-based capital standards is now in its final stages and moving toward implementation. Importantly, that effort has adopted an approach to credit risk for instruments held in the banking book that differs from the current capital rules applied to instruments held in the trading book under the DATE Market Risk Amendment (MRA) to the Basel Accord. Clearly, the fair valuing or \"marking to market\" of commercial bank trading portfolios and the implied short-term holding periods of such positions factor into the different approaches. We must remember, however, that the MRA was adopted at a time when bank trading portfolios looked very different from DATE. Significant growth in structured transactions, collateralized debt obligations, and credit derivatives are just a few examples of the significant developments over DATE. Moreover, the MRA was structured with commercial banks in mind and not broker-dealers who, as you know, mark most of their balance sheets to market. Also, both banking organizations and investment firms appear to be holding less-liquid instruments at fair value over longer time horizons than has been traditionally associated with the concept of a commercial bank trading account. Taken together, these industry and regulatory dynamics suggest that the time may have arrived for supervisors to begin to review the appropriateness of the DATE MRA for commercial bank trading accounts and investment firm fair-valued holdings. In an initial effort to fully identify the types and characteristics of instruments that banks hold in their trading accounts, and that securities firms hold at fair value, a joint subgroup of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is surveying the industry. This survey seeks to gain a better perspective on the range of techniques financial institutions are developing to more robustly measure the risk these instruments entail. The information acquired in the survey is to be fully incorporated in supervisors' review of the current adequacy of the MRA. However, this effort to review the MRA is still in its early stages. As yet, it is uncertain whether the effort will result in minor revisions or significant changes to the current MRA. Challenges in securities accounting and auditing Both of these securities-accounting issues that I have just discussed should also be viewed in light of broader issues that are challenging corporate management, independent accountants, and regulators. Fair value accounting for securities, whether in the income statement or in disclosures, relies on key assumptions, modeling techniques and judgment. For example, modeling techniques are commonly used in valuing mortgage-backed securities. The present value of the estimated future net cash flows attempts to anticipate prepayments of mortgages due to forecasted changes in interest rates. Changes in the assumptions used in the modeling approach for any instrument or product will affect the resulting values. For example, if property values are rising rather than falling, the resulting buildup of home equity can affect a borrower's desire to refinance the loan or use the equity to purchase a more expensive home. Thus, the auditing of model-based fair values for accounting purposes requires a high level of specialized knowledge. The auditor must fully understand how modeling or other sophisticated techniques are used to determine fair value, whether the assumptions used in the models are appropriate, and whether the data have integrity. Furthermore, \"fair value\" is not always clearly defined or easily determined for some products or instruments. The lack of observable market prices, differences in modeling assumptions, expectations of future events and market conditions, and customer behavior make the task of assigning appropriate valuations very difficult. Certainly, a noncomplex instrument that is highly liquid and that has an observable market price is easier to value with more precision than a highly complex, illiquid instrument. Given the myriad of complex financial instruments that currently exist and that are constantly being created, developing verifiable and auditable fair value estimates is a major concern. And because fair value models are forward looking, an auditor has an additional challenge: determining what is the normal variability in expectations that surrounds any forecast and what is earnings manipulation. To its credit, FASB has recently issued an exposure draft on fair value measurement. The proposal provides a framework for fair value measurement objectives, and it is just the initial phase of a long-term fair value project. The initial phase is generally intended to apply to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are currently subject to fair value measurement and disclosure. It is not intended to expand the use of fair value measurements in financial statements at the present time. In my view, the proposal is a good first step in enhancing fair value measurement guidance, but I believe additional guidance is warranted. The proposal should address reliability issues more comprehensively. Most important, FASB should develop additional guidance and conduct more research and testing to enhance the reliability of fair value measurements before the use of fair value is significantly expanded in primary financial statements. Furthermore, FASB should work with other organizations including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and accounting firms to enable the development of robust guidance that ensures fair value estimates can be verified and audited. Anti-tying restrictions on banks Finally, I want to discuss the nature of anti-tying regulations for financial institutions, an issue that can be very confusing to nonbankers. As innovations create new financial instruments, services, and markets, and as banks expand the scope of the financial services they offer, the process banks use to make business decisions is similar to the process many of you apply in your own business. Financial institutions are trying to build customer loyalty by offering a broader menu of financial services to corporate customers. Some of these financial services are more profitable than others, and thus, add greater shareholder value. The concern addressed by anti-tying restrictions is that banks may force customers to take unwanted products in order to obtain needed services - primarily loan products. As a brief background, a special anti-tying statute applies to banks. The statute generally prohibits a bank from conditioning the availability or price of one product on a requirement that a customer also obtain another product that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate of the bank. For example, a bank may not inform a customer that it will provide the customer with a loan only if the customer engages the bank's securities affiliate for an underwriting or obtains some other product or service that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate. The words \"that is not a traditional bank product\" are important. Not all tying arrangements are illegal ties. The statute and the Federal Reserve Board's regulations expressly permit a bank to condition the availability or price of a product or service on a requirement that the customer also obtain one or more traditional bank products from the bank or an affiliate. For example, banks for DATE required customers obtaining construction financing to maintain compensating balances. A traditional bank product generally is defined as any \"loan, discount, deposit, or trust service,\" and the Board's proposed interpretation provides guidance on what types of products fall within the scope of these terms. In light of the complexities of the anti-tying restrictions, the Board has published and received public comment on both an interpretation of the anti-tying statute and on related supervisory guidance. The proposed interpretation was published to help banking organizations and corporate customers clarify permissible practices under this complex statute in DATE's financial services environment. Importantly, the interpretation proposes guidelines that a bank should follow when it seeks to engage in traditional \"relationship banking,\" that is, serving its customers on the basis of the profitability of the overall customer relationship with the entire banking organization. The proposed supervisory guidance communicates our expectations as to the types of policies, procedures, internal controls, and training programs that should help banks comply with the anti-tying restrictions. The proposed guidance also emphasizes the importance of the compliance and internal audit functions in ensuring compliance with the law and regulations. Ensuring compliance can be an extremely difficult endeavor because there is no prohibition against cross selling products or aggressive marketing. The goal is to ensure that banks don't cross the line between offering choices and illegally tying products and services. The Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have long required that banking organizations establish and maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-tying restrictions, and the agencies monitor these policies and procedures through the supervisory process. Admittedly, at times it can be difficult to determine whether a violation of the anti-tying statute has occurred. As I mentioned, some forms of tying by banks are expressly permitted, and the statute does not apply to tying arrangements imposed by a bank's nonbank affiliates. Moreover, divining whether a bank imposed a prohibited tie often requires a close review of the facts and circumstances associated with a particular transaction. A prohibited tie, for example, may be conveyed orally and not memorialized in transaction documentation. Our supervisory reviews indicate that banks generally understand and have implemented systems to ensure compliance with the anti-tying provisions to which they are subject. In addition, although we have encouraged customers that believe they have been the subject of an illegal tie to come forward, we have received few complaints from bank customers. Moreover, few customers have sought to challenge their banks directly, although they are granted a private right of action under the statute and may obtain triple damages if successful. A DATE report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on bank tying practices found that the available evidence did not substantiate claims that banks were engaging in illegal tying, but the report did note that borrowers were reluctant to file formal complaints. The GAO recommended that the Board consider taking additional steps to enforce compliance with the anti-tying provisions. Our proposed interpretation and guidance are intended to help banks and the customers understand this rather complex compliance area. I should mention that we also received a comment letter on the proposed interpretation from the Department of Justice. This letter, which is available on the Department's web site, expresses concern that the bank anti-tying statute itself may suppress competition and harm consumers, especially as it is applied to large customers. The Justice Department recommends that the Board interpret the bank anti-tying statute in a manner similar to the federal antitrust laws. Under federal antitrust laws, which apply to independent broker-dealers, a showing of market power is essential to support a finding that a company has coerced its customer to purchase an unwanted product or service. In contrast, the courts historically have found that the special anti-tying statute that applies only to banks generally does not require a showing of market power to support a violation. Alternatively, the department recommends that the Board exercise its statutory authority to exempt large, corporate customers from the reach of the bank anti-tying statute. These are all issues the Board will have to carefully consider as it moves toward finalizing the anti-tying interpretation and guidance. Conclusion I know that the SIA and your financial firms have been devoting time to many of the regulatory issues that have made the headlines in DATE. I hope that my comments DATE will also remind you that the evolution of the industry and financial products creates challenges that you are likely to encounter in the more normal course of business.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Sound capital and risk management Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the OpRisk USA NUM Conference, New York, DATE.    I would like to thank the sponsors of OpRisk USA for providing an opportunity for bankers, regulators, consultants, and other interested parties to share their perspectives on operational-risk management. DATE, I will speak about the importance of risk management and its relationship to capital. I will also touch on the broad objectives of effective operational-risk management and offer specific observations on some of the challenges of operational-risk quantification. In addition, I will describe the current status of the Basel II process. Importance of risk management Over DATE, we have witnessed substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry, particularly at our largest institutions. These very large entities have broad geographic reach, operate in many lines of business, and offer a wide array of complex products and services. The largest institutions have moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on the balance sheet and have adopted strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets and active management of risks. The risk-management techniques employed by banking organizations continue to improve and adapt to the ever-changing financial landscape. The Federal Reserve, in its role as both a bank supervisor and the nation's central bank, has an obvious interest in maintaining the stability of the banking industry and the financial system as a whole. We, along with our counterparts at the other U.S. bank and thrift regulatory agencies, are responsible for ensuring that banking institutions operate in a safe and sound manner and have strong capital levels. But with the advent of very large banking organizations that engage in a wide variety of business activities--some of them quite complex--the Federal Reserve has become even more interested in ensuring that banking organizations understand the risks of these activities. For their part, bankers continue to improve the risk-management and risk-measurement processes at their institutions, and regulators have supported these efforts. Banks themselves have created many of the new techniques to improve their risk management and internal economic capital measures in order to be more effective competitors and to control and manage their losses. By more clearly defining risk exposures and identifying the causes of and controls for their losses, bank management can more effectively integrate decisions about risk-taking into their strategic and tactical decisionmaking. Banks that integrate risk measurement into their business-line goals often find that this effort helps them to implement their strategic plans more effectively. Ideally, an institution should use a systematic approach to identify and measure its risk exposures; however, even the best processes for evaluating and measuring risk suffer if flawed data are used. To conduct a credible internal analysis of relevant risks, institutions should identify which risks can generally be quantified and which ones cannot. When risk measurements are based on scarce or incomplete data, or on unproven quantitative tools, institutions might need to use sensitivity analyses, stress tests, or scenario analyses to a greater extent in order to develop meaningful risk measures. Banks that wish to remain competitive must keep up with the latest developments in risk measurement and management. Bankers must ensure that their models keep up with current practice and continue to capture risks accurately, especially as new activities and new products are introduced. Similarly, the supervisory community needs to keep up with developments in banking and finance. We consider this vitally important because banking is and will remain a highly dynamic industry. Supervisors will have to pay attention to evolving sound practices and ensure that new regulations do not unduly inhibit banks from adopting new banking practices and financial instruments. Our focus on balancing developments in the industry with safe and sound operations at institutions is increasingly important, given the growing complexity, sophistication, and concentration of DATE's banking system. And with the advent of Basel II, which is intended to update capital rules for large, internationally active U.S. banking organizations, supervisors must become even more involved in understanding emerging sound practices in risk measurement and management. One of the most important sound practices for a banking organization is the tying of risk exposures to capital. Banks that use similar risk models can have very different risk exposures. That is why the Basel II approach to capital is so important. Basel II provides a framework in which the risk level banks choose to accept is reflected in their capital. Banks with higher loss exposures will be required to hold more capital than those who have lower risk appetites. This provides a strong relationship with risk management, in that returns earned in riskier business lines will necessarily be higher to cover the cost of the additional capital held. Operational-risk management Focusing now on operational risk, one of the most substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry in DATE is the movement of the largest organizations toward fee-based revenue streams. These new activities include securitizing loan portfolios, with the bank retaining responsibility for loan servicing; buying and selling financial instruments for customers; and other business lines that generate revenue by charging customers transaction and account processing fees. These activities generate little balance-sheet exposure, but they present the potential for large losses if the complex systems and financial deals associated with them are not managed in a sound manner. Operational risks are also becoming more important in the large, complex financial institution as more technology and automated processes are used in all areas of operations. When banks used manual processes, errors were confined to the limited area where the employee worked. But in a modern technology setting, factors such as breakdowns in controls, errors in software code, and processing stream interruptions can have enterprisewide effects on the performance of the organization. Recent history provides us with ample evidence that operational risk can be significant. Large financial institutions have reported operational losses from breakdowns in operating controls that, in some cases, have exceeded their credit- or market-related losses. In the area of legal risk, for example, many institutions have learned that failing to identify and promptly correct problems can result in losses that significantly exceed management's initial expectations. Over DATE, large financial institutions have experienced more than NUM operational loss events in excess of $NUM million each; some of these individual operational losses, resulting from fraud, rogue trading, and settlements stemming from questionable business practices, have exceeded $NUM billion. An effective operational-risk management framework, therefore, is essential for identifying and managing operational risks. As you know, analysts at the main rating agencies are placing increasing importance on operational risk when they assess a bank's credit ratings. We believe effective operational-risk management has both quantitative and qualitative components and that reliance on solely quantitative or solely qualitative approaches is no longer appropriate. What remains critically important is how these approaches are combined in the implementation of an effective process for identifying, measuring, managing, and controlling operational risk throughout an organization. Effective operational-risk measurement tools enable the executive management at the largest banking organizations to make better risk-and-return decisions, thereby enhancing the return on their institution's capital investments. By considering operational risk as part of their assessment of capital requirements and true profitability, corporate decisionmakers can better decide which business lines to invest in or shut down. The organization further benefits when operational-risk measurement is integrated with the management processes of individual business units, because this helps communicate risk-management issues to the business lines. The allocation of operational-risk capital to these units provides them with a financial incentive to reduce the chance of operational losses. Hard numbers, linked to specific risks, also allow business lines to more accurately price their products. Some banking organizations are already benefiting by factoring operational-risk measurement and management into pricing decisions, strategic planning processes, portfolio management activities, management reporting metrics, and decisions regarding incentive compensation. There are potential longer-term benefits as well, including: a reduction in operational losses as control weaknesses are identified and improved; fewer errors and breaks in customer service, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and retention; stronger information security and customer data privacy; higher credit ratings, and increased operational efficiency. One objective of Basel II is to enhance practices at our largest and most complex banking organizations for identifying operational risk exposures and ensuring that these exposures are appropriately supported by regulatory capital. Importantly, the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk under Basel II allows banks to use a framework that relies on their own qualifying methodologies for identifying operational-loss events and measuring risk exposure in order to determine their operational-risk regulatory capital requirements. In this way, the AMA gives banks the flexibility to continue developing and incorporating evolving sound practices for operational-risk measurement and management into their AMA frameworks. Challenges to operational-risk quantification under Basel II In the context of Basel II, it has often been argued that measuring operational risk is much more difficult than measuring market or credit risk; however, any model intended to capture unexpected loss has its challenges. For example, market-risk models can be violated when the price of financial products moves in a way that is outside of the historical norm. Credit-risk models need to consider downturn estimates for loss given default, which can depend on the severity of the economic downturn and the price of collateral. Similarly, operational-risk models need to address potential losses that may not have occurred during the short period that most institutions have been collecting internal operational-loss data. This absence of a robust time series of internal operational-loss data is one factor that makes operational-risk modeling particularly challenging. To address the difficulties presented by the very nature of operational risk, the designers of operational-risk measurement frameworks have had to be innovative. For example, we have seen frameworks that use scenario analyses, risk self-assessments, and the judgment of senior business managers in innovative ways. We have also seen creativity in the melding of internal and external loss data to guide thinking about internal loss exposures. Perhaps most significantly, we have seen some truly innovative thinking about ways to integrate operational-risk measurement into the broader framework of operational-risk management. I would like to offer some specific observations on a couple of key challenges relating to operationalrisk quantification. First, with respect to operational-loss data, Basel II banks face the challenge of establishing credible operational-loss databases that they can use in determining their regulatory capital requirement for operational risk. The advanced approaches under Basel II create a link between regulatory capital and risk management. Banks using an AMA for operational risk will be required to adopt more-formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management procedures and processes. For example, Basel II establishes standards for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. These standards are consistent with broader supervisory expectations that high-quality risk management at large complex organizations depends on credible data--and not just for Basel II. Data are needed for all models and risk measures used in financial services, including credit-scoring models, market-based measures such as KMV, and value-at-risk and other economic capital models. The emphasis in Basel II on improved data standards, therefore, should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital standards but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices that will strengthen the value of the banking franchise. As I mentioned earlier, regulators view capital from the perspective of ensuring safety and soundness in the financial system. But individual financial institutions generally focus on capital, in particular economic capital, as a means for evaluating the profitability of their activities, defining their risk appetite, and setting risk limits. Although the goals differ, there are important linkages between firms' efforts to quantify operational-risk capital for regulatory capital purposes and for strategic decisionmaking. To the extent the operational-loss data considered in banks' internal economic capital models appropriately reflect the banks' risk exposures, banks should be able to leverage their economic capital data collection efforts to measure their operational-risk exposure under an AMA. This leverage is also consistent with the Basel II objective of better aligning regulatory capital with banks' internal economic capital. The second challenge I wanted to touch on is banks' integration of insurance in their processes for quantifying operational risk. As many of you are aware, Basel II contains a provision whereby banks using an advanced measurement approach for operational risk could adjust their calculated operational-risk exposure to reflect reductions due to operational-risk mitigants, such as insurance, subject to certain limitations. According to the Basel II framework, a bank's risk-mitigation calculations must reflect the bank's insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the bank's overall determination of its operational-risk capital. To the extent banks want to reduce their operational-risk capital charge through the use of insurance, banks must analyze and demonstrate the relationship between specific losses and the ability to collect from the insurer. At the time of the Loss Data Collection Exercise, banks that incorporated insurance benefits into their operational risk capital calculations appeared to do so through an ex-post adjustment to their capital figure in the aggregate, rather than by embedding the specific effects of insurance into the AMA modeling process itself. We expect operational risk managers to work closely with their insurance managers to make better decisions about insurance coverage. This should include clear communication of the nature of individual loss exposures and consideration of the availability of insurance coverage for particular risks. While work remains for those banks that are building their AMA frameworks, we have seen, and continue to see, significant progress in these AMA development efforts. One indication of this progress can be seen in the results of the Loss Data Collection Exercise. This exercise resulted in the submission of over one million internal operational-loss event observations by participating institutions. As you know, internal loss-event data are a key input for determining an institution's regulatory capital requirement for operational risk. These data have provided the agencies with invaluable insights about the comprehensiveness of data at individual institutions. The agencies have provided feedback to participating institutions that should help them in their continuing AMA development efforts. In addition, the agencies continue to analyze the loss data in an effort to provide the industry with additional insights relating to operational-risk quantification. Proposed revisions to regulatory capital regime I have referred to certain parts of the Basel II framework in my remarks so far, mostly relating to operational risk and the AMA. Now I would like to give a brief update on where we stand with implementing Basel II in the United States, as well as with amending the current Basel I regime. First of all, you may have heard that DATE the Federal Reserve Board plans to review a draft of the interagency Basel II notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) at a public meeting, meaning that a draft NPR will also be made available to the public at that time. The final NPR is expected to be issued in the Federal Register after all of the U.S. banking agencies complete their review and approval processes, meaning it will then be \"officially\" out for comment. We are pleased that the agencies have reached agreement on the draft NPR, since, as you know, we have spent substantial time and considerable effort on the document. We also recognize the extent to which the industry, Congress, and others have anticipated the release of this document--and the greater detail it contains about Basel II in the United States. Of course, we look forward to hearing feedback on the NPR. Your comments and those from others will contribute importantly to the assessment of Basel II objectives and its implementation, and will help us as we develop the framework further. Reasons for pursuing Basel II I think it is helpful, as we anticipate release of the NPR, to review the reasons we are developing U.S. proposals for Basel II. The current Basel I capital framework, adopted DATE, has served us well but has become increasingly inadequate for large, internationally active banks offering ever-more complex and sophisticated products and services. We need a revised capital framework for these banks, and we believe that Basel II is such a framework. One of the major ways in which Basel II should improve safety and soundness is by more closely linking capital requirements to risk. The current Basel I measures are not very risk sensitive and do not provide meaningful measures to bankers, supervisors, or the marketplace for complex banking organizations. Under Basel I, it is possible for two banks with dramatically different risk profiles to have the same minimum capital requirement, and a bank's capital requirement does not reflect deterioration in asset quality. In addition, the balance-sheet focus of Basel I does not adequately capture risks of certain off-balance-sheet transactions and fee-based activity--for example, the operational risk embedded in the services from which many large U.S. institutions generate a good portion of their revenues. In addition to enhancing the meaningfulness of regulatory capital measures, Basel II should make the financial system safer by substantially improving risk management at banks. Basel II builds on the riskmanagement approaches of well-managed banks and creates incentives for banks to move toward leading risk-measurement and risk-management practices; we have already seen some progress in risk management at many institutions in the United States and around the globe as a result of discussions about and preparations for Basel II. The new framework is also much more consistent with the internal capital measures that institutions use to manage their business. Basel II can also provide supervisors with a more conceptually consistent and more transparent framework for assessing the linkage of risk and capital over time at our most complex institutions; identifying which institutions have deficiencies; and, ultimately, evaluating systemic risk in the banking system. Therefore, Basel II establishes a more coherent relationship between how supervisors assess regulatory capital and how they supervise the banks, enabling examiners to better evaluate whether banks are holding prudent capital levels, given their risk profiles, and to better understand differences across institutions. Compared with the current framework, Basel II is more able to accommodate new products and transaction types and to provide meaningful capital measures for the risks embedded therein. As the central bank and the supervisor of banks, bank holding companies, and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Basel II framework delivers a strong and risk-sensitive base of capital. That is why we support safeguards to ensure strong capital levels during the transition to Basel II, and why we will remain vigilant in monitoring the ongoing impact of and Basel II. This means that during after the transition to Basel II, supervisors will rely on ongoing, detailed analyses to continuously evaluate the results of the new framework and ensure prudent levels of capital. To be quite clear, the Federal Reserve believes that strong capital is fundamentally important to the health of our banking system. We believe Basel II will be a strong contributor to our tradition of ensuring that U.S. banks maintain capital levels that provide an appropriate cushion against risk-taking. As we have stated before, we will continue to use existing prudential measures to complement Basel II. For example, the current leverage ratio requirement--a ratio of capital to total assets--will remain unchanged for all banks, whether or not they are subject to the Basel II framework. Also, supervisors will continue to enforce existing prompt-corrective-action-requirements in response to declines in capital. Both the leverage ratio and prompt corrective action are fully consistent with Basel II. Proposed amendments to Basel I Before I end my remarks about regulatory capital, I would like to offer some thoughts about ongoing efforts to revise existing regulatory capital rules, known as Basel I. First of all, we expect only one or two dozen banks to move to Basel II in the near term. That is, the vast majority of U.S. banks would be able to continue operating safely and soundly under Basel I, as it is amended through the rulemaking process. The Basel I framework already has been amended more than twenty times in response to changes in the banking industry and a better understanding of the risks in individual products and services. The agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to amend the Basel I rules. Concerns have been raised about potential competitive inequities between Basel II banks and Basel I banks. We take these concerns seriously. In an effort to mitigate those concerns, regulators have proposed changes to enhance the risk sensitivity of U.S. Basel I rules and remain vigilant about potential competitive distortions that might be created by introducing Basel II rules. We are also mindful that amendments to Basel I should not be too complex or too burdensome for the multitude of smaller banks to which the revised rules will apply. Additionally, we recognize the need to have full transparency about Basel II proposals and proposed Basel I amendments. Accordingly, we expect to have overlapping comment periods for both the Basel II NPR and the proposed Basel I amendments. The intent is to allow banks and others to review both NPRs before both sets of rules are finalized. In that way, bankers from potential opt-in institutions and from those not planning to move to Basel II can evaluate the potential impact of Basel II in light of the proposed Basel I amendments. In fact, we want all interested parties to compare, contrast, and comment on the two proposals in overlapping time frames. At this point, we are still reviewing the comments received on the ANPR for amendments to Basel I (the comment period ended in DATE). The agencies are developing their proposals for Basel I amendments, on the basis of comments received, and hope to have a Basel I NPR DATE. Conclusion As prudent supervisors, we need to ensure that banks have strong capital levels--whether banks operate under our current rules, revisions to our current rules, or Basel II. Our focus will continue to be on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate for operations of each institution and that those risk systems operate effectively. Our challenge as regulators is to work with the industry in developing an effective capital framework. We envision Basel II as a significant step toward a more risk-sensitive capital framework. We strongly encourage you to comment on all aspects of the Basel II NPR, so that we have a well-informed basis for further development of the Basel II framework.",

                  "Roger W Ferguson, Jr: The proposed U.S. approach to regulatory capital - an update Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the conference on The Changing Regulatory Capital Regime in Europe: A Challenging New Business Concept, Brussels, Belgium (via videoconference), DATE.    Good TIME. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to join you at this impressive conference. You asked me to provide some thoughts about Basel II, particularly its application in the United States. Before doing that, I would like to inform you of our progress in developing the new accord. As most of you know, we are in a very important stage of the process. Over DATE there have been some crucial developments as a result of the discussions among member regulators, a demonstration once again of the Basel Committee's determination to listen to comments and make those modifications necessary to deliver the best accord possible. The proposal for a capital standard based on unexpected losses submitted by the committee for public comment is a good example of this earnestness in seeking an improved final product. Other issues are still being discussed, including securitization, retail credit, and credit risk mitigation. One should not forget that, on a parallel track, member countries still have to complete their own domestic efforts to translate the accord into national regulation. As you probably know, the comment period for the initial U.S. proposal for Basel II - known as the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) - just ended DATE. U.S. supervisors are reviewing the comments carefully. If supportable arguments are given for further accord alterations, we will develop proposed changes to present to our colleagues on the committee. In the United States, after this next round of discussions there will still be additional procedural steps before a final rule is in place, with opportunity for comment at each stage. To be clear, the need for more procedural steps in the United States should not be taken as an indication of our lack of commitment to the Basel process. Rather, it is a sign of our attempt to develop these proposals on as transparent a basis as possible and to hear a wide range of comments. The Congress of the United States has also held hearings on the development of the new accord. The interest and oversight by our Congress in these discussions is appropriate and welcome, particularly for an undertaking as extensive as Basel II. The U.S. regulators appreciate the fact that we are able to operate as independent agencies but also realize that we have an obligation to keep the elected representatives informed of our progress in this major effort. Of course, it is expected that other countries and the European Union will be following their own procedures as well. Overall, I have been impressed by the efficacy of the comment process and believe it offers an open forum for all parties to voice their opinions. Debate and discussion on such an important undertaking are essential, and - if solid and convincing arguments are put forth - provide a real opportunity for enhancements to the final product. The current proposal is better because the comments have elicited good ideas that have been taken seriously. Future comments based on sound thought and evidence will create further modifications. But I must say that simple assertions will not carry very much weight. At the same time, we do need to ensure that momentum is maintained. In DATE, the committee members committed to work promptly to resolve outstanding issues by DATE. In DATE, the Basel Committee will meet to address further analysis of outstanding issues and review the timetable for completing and implementing the committee's work on the accord. Using the agreement reached in the committee as a template, U.S. supervisors then plan to conduct another Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) to gauge more clearly the impact of the Basel proposals. We believe it is critical that we carefully test the new proposal to determine its effects on individual institutions and to ascertain the need to fine-tune the proposal further, a process that could include recalibrating some of the risk-weight functions. It is our sense that other countries will be doing the same. Because timing is a function of the degree of changes required by the QIS, the U.S. agencies will then conduct a full notice of proposed rulemaking once again to seek and then evaluate public comments before adopting a final rule. U.S. proposals for Basel II Against that background, let me turn to a number of topics that some have raised about Basel II. The U.S. banking agencies have, as you know, proposed to implement Basel II somewhat differently than other nations have. These differences are perfectly consistent with the spirit and letter of the proposal, and reflect the particular characteristics of the U.S. banking system and the rules and regulations under which it operates. While our approach is best for the United States, it is not necessarily best for other nations. The U.S. banking agencies propose that only the most advanced approaches under Basel II be offered for banking organizations in the United States: the advanced internal ratings-based approach for credit risk, known as A-IRB, and the advanced measurement approach for operational risk, known as AMA. As indicated in the ANPR, the standardized approach and the foundation IRB approach to Basel II would not be permitted for credit risk. Nor would the basic indicator approach or standardized approach be available for operational risk. The banking agencies took considerable time to develop the advanced proposals, which we believed would clearly be the best option for the U.S. banking system. The complex operations of the largest banks have outgrown the existing capital regime, and for them Basel I has become less and less effective. Indeed, in the view of U.S. supervisors, an overhaul of the regulatory capital system for our largest banks would be worthwhile only if the most advanced approaches were used. Because of the heterogeneous nature of the U.S. banking system, some balance in the application of Basel II would be necessary. On the one hand, the size, scale and complexity of the internationally active U.S. banks requires, in the opinion of the U.S. supervisors, that these entities operate with the best feasible risk measurement and management procedures, and these procedures are most consistent with the advanced versions of Basel II. On the other hand, the U.S. agencies do not want to impose the higher costs of the advanced version of Basel II on institutions for which it is clearly not suited. In the end, the U.S. banking agencies tried to allow as much choice as possible, while ensuring that banks are still meeting domestic regulatory obligations, avoiding private-sector costs that do not produce some clear and convincing level of benefits, abiding by the evolving Basel II agreement, and, most important, maintaining a safe and sound U.S. banking system. The U.S. banks that would be required to adopt Basel II, as well as those that we expect to choose or opt in to the new regulatory capital rules, are those that, because of size and complexity, should operate with the most sophisticated risk-management practices. The ANPR lays out objective criteria, including asset size and foreign exposure, to identify the large, internationally active banks that would be considered mandatory banks. Naturally, there are also thousands of banks in the United States that do not qualify as large and internationally active and for which the advanced approach of Basel II may not necessarily be appropriate. The overwhelming majority of these banks are significantly less complex and have a scale of operations and market that generally does not extend beyond the United States. As I will discuss, these entities need not be covered by the revised accord to meet international obligations or our own regulatory responsibilities. Thus, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed that those banks not operating under Basel II advanced approaches would remain under the current U.S. regulatory capital rules. An important factor in our decision to retain the current capital regime for those entities that are neither large nor significant global competitors is the scale and nature of the existing capital regime in the United States. The U.S. supervisory regime already contains the substantial elements of Pillar Two under Basel II, including evaluations of internal capital adequacy processes. U.S. supervisors have for DATE conducted extensive and thorough on-site supervisory reviews, a process which we believe has contributed to a sound banking and financial system. In addition, the culture of disclosure within the United States already comes close to, and in some areas exceeds, the Pillar Three requirements of the accord revisions. For those U.S. institutions with public debt or equity, requirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as demands by the market, translate into fairly extensive public disclosure. Moreover, these small and medium-sized banks for the most part already hold capital well in excess of the supervisory minima under both the current and proposed capital regimes. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of U.S. banks maintain capital above the well-capitalized criteria of NUM percent of risk-weighted assets under the U.S. prompt corrective action rules, and generally the smaller the bank, the larger the proportionate capital cushion. Nearly NUM percent of all small and medium-sized banks have regulatory capital ratios of at least NUM percent, and thus it is likely that their current ratios would essentially meet or surpass proposed requirements under Basel II. Therefore, we believe that the current approach to determining regulatory minimum capital in the United States is at least as prudent as Basel II. While U.S. supervisors see no need to require Basel II for banks not considered large or internationally active, the proposal would allow any bank to adopt the accord revisions if it so desired. Of course, any bank wishing to adopt Basel II would have to meet the same high standards applied to mandatory institutions, particularly the internal measurement and management of risk for its exposures. For some large nonmandatory regional institutions, moving to Basel II may be a good choice, and we anticipate that at least ten, and perhaps more, may do so. In effect, the approach proposed in the United States requires that those institutions that would not be required by scale or global activities to adopt the A-IRB version of Basel II would have to conduct their own cost-benefit analysis to determine if they should opt in or wait, perhaps for the costs of implementation to come down through vendor and other developments, or, alternatively, if they should remain under the current capital regime. Initially, some of our colleagues on the Basel Supervisors' Committee criticized the U.S. agencies' approach to scope of application, claiming that the application was too limited or inconsistent with the proposed accord. But this criticism has faded with better understanding of the structure of the U.S. banking system: More than two-thirds of the assets of U.S. banking organizations are likely to be covered by Basel II, as well as more than NUM percent of the foreign claims held by U.S. banking organizations. Potential competitive effects The U.S. agencies have increasingly focused on the potential competitive effects of Basel II on U.S. banks. As the ANPR outlines, policymakers will be attentive to the competitive concerns of both the institutions expected to adopt Basel II in the United States, and those that might not. We are of course interested in the evidence developed from the ANPR. In addition, Fed staff members are now conducting empirical research to try to determine if the bifurcated approach has any implications for possible acquisition strategies to be used by advanced Basel II banks in acquiring non-Basel II banks. Moreover, we are also trying to determine empirically the evidence for the competitive implications of the U.S. implementation proposals on credit for small and medium-sized business, residential mortgage, and credit card markets. If that empirical evidence indicates a high probability of general competitive imbalances, we will then review our options for addressing the problem. But we first need to see the evidence that a problem exists and then determine how large it may be. That these issues surfaced, I might add, illustrates the benefits of a transparent comment period. Standards for Basel II One would hope that, by now, no one misunderstands the extensive requirements for any institution adopting Basel II, particularly for the advanced approaches that will be the only option in the United States. Because capital requirements under the advanced approaches will be based on bank inputs, the bar will clearly have to be raised, particularly for risk management and control systems. For most banks - in fact, I would say for all banks moving to the advanced versions of Basel II - meeting these standards and requirements will be very challenging and will require substantial resources. Managers at some institutions may believe that their institution is already very close to meeting all the prerequisites for Basel II. Although our rules and standards are not yet final, on the basis of pilot reviews and discussions with line supervisors here in the United States, I would advise any institution thinking it has little work remaining to make a careful and frank reassessment of where it stands. In the United States we are developing a set of supervisory guidance to accompany our rulemaking. This supervisory guidance, which will be developed for all A-IRB credit portfolios of Basel II as well as for the AMA, is intended to provide additional clarity and interpretation of the rule, and to more clearly define supervisory expectations. And the guidance, by describing in more detail what it will take to satisfy U.S. supervisors, should assist nonmandatory banks in deciding whether to opt in. Initial drafts of supervisory guidance for corporate A-IRB and for AMA were published for comment in concert with the ANPR. U.S. regulators are already reviewing feedback on this draft supervisory guidance and, as with the ANPR, remain open to suggestions for altering that guidance if we are presented with valid arguments for doing so. Draft guidance for other A-IRB portfolios, such as retail, is being developed and will be published for comment as well. This is also a good opportunity for me to add a few initial thoughts about the possible nature of qualifying examinations for Basel II in the United States. As I noted, we still need to reach an agreement in Basel and complete the process for formulating a final rule in the United States before we can start assessing institutions vis-à-vis new standards related to Basel II. However, the U.S. agencies are starting to identify, on a joint basis, what a qualification process for Basel II would encompass, both for mandatory and opt-in banking organizations. This will not be an easy task, in part because our particular regulatory structure has different supervisors overseeing different banks and legal entity types. And it will be complicated by the need to coordinate qualification internationally with host jurisdictions to minimize the burden on banking organizations supervised by agencies from multiple countries. Cooperation among the U.S. agencies on this and other matters relating to Basel II implementation has been excellent. There is, of course, no expectation that under Basel II the U.S. regulatory structure will change in terms of the legal mandates assigned to each agency. As the ANPR states, an institution's primary federal supervisor would have responsibility for determining an institution's readiness for an advanced approach and ultimately would be responsible, after consultation with other relevant supervisors, for determining whether the institution satisfies the supervisory expectations for the advanced approaches. And this procedure will obviously apply at both the bank and bank holding company level in the United States. Given the significance of Basel II, enhanced communication and cooperation among U.S. supervisory agencies - and between U.S. supervisors and affected host country supervisors - will be necessary. We are already in agreement that the U.S. qualification process will be intensive, rigorous, and lengthy, because of the nature of what we are about to embark upon. But in the end we believe that a rigorous qualification process will create a more risk-sensitive regulatory capital regime and improve risk management. Cross-border issues The accord revisions wisely contain a certain amount of flexibility to account for differences in the banking systems of member countries. These so-called national discretion elements, combined with different approaches that member countries might choose for their banking system, mean that maintaining a level playing field across countries is a challenge. Achieving an acceptable level of consistency in implementation is something that the Basel Committee takes seriously and is the reason it formed the Accord Implementation Group (AIG) DATE. The AIG comprises line supervisors from member countries and is charged with identifying potential implementation issues and creating as much consistency as possible across countries. These issues, which are referred to as \"cross border\" or \"home/host\" issues, cover both credit and operational risk. Cross-border issues are particularly complicated because the new accord will apply to both consolidated banking organizations in home countries as well as subsidiary bank and bank holding companies in host countries. DATE the AIG issued a set of high-level principles for cross-border implementation of the accord. These principles lay the groundwork for further cooperation and coordination for implementation among member countries. They clearly identify the need to respect both home and host country rules and regulations, the need for enhanced and pragmatic cooperation between both types of supervisors, and the desire for supervisors to minimize the burden on banking groups as much as possible. The U.S. agencies believe that their choice for scope of application is consistent with these principles. For example, the proposal to allow only the advanced approaches in the United States also extends to any U.S. banking subsidiaries of foreign banking organizations and reflects our legitimate role as host country supervisors and the principles of national treatment. At the same time, we understand that other countries may offer approaches that are different from those offered in the United States. So a consolidated banking organization not based in the United States may choose to operate under an approach not offered in our country - such as foundation IRB for credit risk or basic indicator for operational risk - even though the advanced approaches would be the only ones available to its U.S. bank and bank holding company subsidiaries. And if those U.S. subsidiaries are not considered mandatory Basel II institutions, they also have the option of remaining on the current U.S. regulatory capital regime. By the same logic, foreign banking subsidiaries of U.S.-based organizations would have to abide by the local rules and regulations of host country supervisors, even if their consolidated entity is operating under different rules. These differences between approaches offered in host versus home countries present challenges for global banking organizations, both foreign-based and U.S.-based. As a result, U.S. supervisors need to work very closely with supervisors from other member countries to assist banking organizations in meeting the various requirements. The AIG has already begun to foster this type of collaboration. For this issue the bottom line is that legal mandates across countries are not going to change, and supervisors realize that they have an added responsibility to keep complexity to a minimum. One of the most challenging home/host issues that has arisen of late is the allocation of operational risk capital within a consolidated banking organization. This issue, similar to other cross-border issues, goes right to the heart of home/host supervision. The conflict arises because host supervisors may require subsidiary banks at the local level to hold a certain amount of capital which, when aggregated across both geography and entity type, may be greater than what the consolidated organization deems necessary, because of diversification effects. This is clearly a difficult issue. As Chairman Caruana commented DATE, it may well take some time for our efforts to converge to an acceptable solution in this matter, and that solution may not be completely satisfactory for all parties. Right now the AIG is working with the Committee's Risk Management Group (RMG) to develop a set of possible solutions to the problem. My expectation is that reaching a solution will require a slow and steady effort, but in the end, we will reach an acceptable compromise. In that sense, this issue reflects much of what the Basel II process is all about - identifying challenging issues, listening carefully to comments, conducting analysis to find a range of possible options, and then reaching an acceptable compromise solution that is consistent with safety and soundness. Finally, I would like to turn to the AIG's work on consistency of standards. Because member countries have different supervisory regimes, there is the possibility for Basel II rules to be applied in a variety of ways. While some variety in standards across countries may be unavoidable, we believe that maintaining as much consistency as possible is a worthwhile objective. It benefits no one if there is an appearance that countries vary considerably in their application of standards. The entire accord is undermined if a set of banks from one country appears to be subject to softer standards. We are already happy with the progress we have seen within the AIG on this issue and believe that pursuing the goal of consistent standards will truly bring about a better and safer global banking system. Concluding thoughts I thank you for the opportunity to share some of my thoughts on Basel II. As I stated, I consider the recent decisions reached by the Basel Committee to be a very good example of how supportable and valid arguments for alterations in the accord proposals are taken seriously. In the United States, additional opportunities still remain for comments to be heard and for possible modifications as the United States continues its rulemaking processes. That said, we do not expect to slacken the high standards expected of banks operating under the advanced approaches for Basel II. The U.S. agencies have tailored the application of Basel II to the particular characteristics of the U.S. banking system, while maintaining both the letter and spirit of the accord. We expect other countries to act similarly with regard to their own banking systems. We understand that a number of cross-border issues relating to Basel II implementation pose challenges, and that it may take some time to resolve them. This will of course mean that supervisors across countries must work even more closely together. But I hope it is evident that the fervent efforts among member countries to heed comments and to find solutions underscore our commitment to craft the best accord revisions possible, while maintaining a safe and sound global banking system.",

                  "Susan Schmidt Bies: Linkages between internal capital measures and regulatory capital requirements Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the International Center for Business Information's Risk Management Conference: Basel Summit, Geneva, DATE.    I thank you for the invitation to speak at this impressive conference and am honored to have the opportunity to start the program. I believe that conferences such as this provide an excellent forum for regulators, bankers, academics, and other practitioners to share ideas, discuss outstanding issues, and learn from one another. I particularly appreciate the opportunity to talk with those of you in the industry, listen to your views, and hear about your experiences. Today I would like to discuss the linkage between internal capital measures and regulatory capital requirements and give you some insights into the lessons learned in the United States from the fourth Quantitative Impact Study--known as DATE. Importance of capital in the banking business I would like to begin by offering some general thoughts about the importance of capital and its linkage to risks. From a regulatory perspective, capital is obviously an invaluable support for the safety and soundness of our banking system. One can point to many historical examples in which countries' banking and financial systems suffered due to inadequate capital during times of stress. But I think you would all agree that not just the regulators see the importance of capital. Most bank customers, investors, counterparties and rating agencies would agree that capital provides an important backstop against risk-taking. Generally, economic models of capital are tied to unexpected losses. The assumption is that expected losses in the ordinary course of business should be covered by normal operating earnings. For losses beyond the normal range of expectations, sufficient capital should be in place to absorb the loss and leave the financial institution stable and able to continue operating effectively. Thus, financial institutions and lines of business with weaker profit margins or greater range of loss possibilities should have more capital. It is important here to distinguish between higher expected losses, for which bankers raise prices to cover risks, and higher unexpected losses, which require additional capital. Indeed, bankers continue to improve the risk-management and -measurement processes at their institutions, and regulators have been supportive of these efforts. Management--by more clearly defining risk exposures, drivers of losses, and mitigants of loss--can more effectively integrate decisions about risk-taking into their strategic and tactical decisionmaking. Banks that integrate risk measurement into business-line goals believe that it has improved the effective implementation of strategic plans. Managers \"compete\" for capital by demonstrating that the risk-adjusted returns in their line of business are more attractive than other alternatives. Tying capital to risks One of the questions regulators have been asked as we work toward implementing Basel II is whether we can just continue to encourage the improvement in risk modeling at banks and stop there, i.e., not tie risk models to capital. While improvements in the methodology of risk models and the transparency of better risk modeling in business decisionmaking are very useful, I believe we cannot stop there. Banks that have similar models of risk can have very different inherent levels of risk. That is, each institution has to decide what level of risk it is willing to accept to run its business. Some organizations are willing to take on much greater levels of risk than others. Some lines of business and some products are inherently riskier than others, while some organizations may be more adverse to accept risk than others. For safety and soundness reasons, bank supervisors must be sure that a bank with greater exposure to riskier lines of business, products, and customers holds more capital than a bank that is more risk adverse and designs its business plan to minimize risk taking. That is, just looking at risk models and not tying capital to the measured risk exposures does not provide the backstop that supervisors need to ensure that each institution has the appropriate capital in place before the unexpected loss occurs. Capital should be based on risk exposures, and the evolving risk modeling methodologies provide improved tools to better determine the appropriate level of capital. Let me add a point about the differences between minimum regulatory capital, as set out in Basel I, Basel II, or any supervisory model, and the level of capital that banks may choose to hold for business reasons. In almost all cases, banks hold capital above the regulatory minimum. Sometimes markets and customers demand a stronger credit rating at the bank than that implied by a minimum capital framework. Many banks also want to remain prepared to promptly pursue mergers and new business expansion opportunities as they arise, which requires capital above the regulatory minimum. They might also wish to hold additional capital if there are concerns about their ability to raise it in future periods. Such justifications for holding capital above regulatory minimums are entirely appropriate, indeed necessary, for determining the appropriate level of capital for an individual institution. Ideally, an institution should use a systematic process to assess its internal capital needs, one that takes a holistic approach to the firm's risks and complements its regulatory capital measures. As many of you know, the Federal Reserve has had, for DATE, a program to foster our largest, most complex banks' ability to assess internal capital needs. We believe that our discussions with bankers over DATE have improved the manner in which institutions determine the amount of capital they should hold, as well as helped improve their risk-measurement and risk-management practices. Identifying and measuring relevant risks In discussions with institutions, we see that successful internal capital processes emphasize the need to identify and measure all relevant risks. Obviously, these include credit, market, and operational risk, but also encompass certain other risk types--such as liquidity, interest rate, strategic, and legal risks. These \"other\" risks might indeed be the most relevant ones for certain institutions. In addition, institutions should be mindful of the difficulty in evaluating risks embedded in new products, instruments, and services; I would point to the potential risks associated with new mortgage products as one example. In conducting a credible internal analysis of relevant risks, institutions should identify those that are generally able to be quantified, and that are those not. Even the best processes for evaluating and measuring risk suffer if the data used are flawed. For those cases in which measurements of risk are based on scarce or incomplete data, or unproven quantitative tools, institutions might arrive at their measure of risk through a greater use of sensitivity analysis, stress tests, or scenario analysis. Determining appropriate capital levels Obviously, one should not simply stop at risk identification: Risk exposures should be tied to capital. The manner in which this is done should be well documented and updated regularly for appropriateness and relevance. Successful institutions pay particular attention to the need to maintain additional capital beyond what is suggested by quantitative or other measures--both for individual activities as well as in the aggregate. Most institutions maintain a \"cushion\" above internally generated capital measures to account for the vicissitudes of real life not necessarily captured in models. Additionally, management should remember that assumptions may become dated, leading to mismeasurement or misunderstanding of risks and the capital needed to support them. Institutions should also evaluate whether their long-run capital targets might differ from short-run goals, based on current and planned changes in risk profiles and the recognition that accommodating new capital needs can require significant lead time. Successful institutions have contingency plans, based on stress-test outcomes, to address potential capital shortfalls or liquidity and funding issues. Controls and oversight As this audience knows well, good risk management is more than just having high-quality data and sophisticated quantitative tools. Control and oversight mechanisms are vital elements of assessing internal capital needs. As prudent supervisors, we require any organization with complex risk profiles, for example those employing sophisticated financial practices or using complex financial instruments, to have a governance and control structure commensurate with those activities. That is, senior management of the bank should set appropriate limits in line with the risk appetite set by the board of directors, and communicate them to line staff. Management should also design and implement effective internal controls and have a robust process for monitoring exposures. Standards should be just as high in this area as they are for risk measurement and data maintenance. For if banks do not create an appropriate environment in which their quantitative risk measures and associated models are used--in other words, if an institution considers internal controls to be just a checklist--risk measures will not provide the performance the bank hopes to achieve. Indeed, in my work as a banker, I realized that effective measurement and management of risks usually can only be achieved within a management culture that sees risk management as the responsibility of line management across the institution and encourages more than just capital calculations. Keeping pace with developments in risk management The rapid developments in finance, technology, and information systems have provided tremendous benefits to customers and raised the productivity of banking institutions. These innovations also contribute to financial stability more broadly. Keeping up with the latest developments in risk measurement and risk management is a considerable challenge--indeed a necessity--for institutions wishing to remain in business. Bankers must ensure that the models keep up with current practice and continue to capture risks accurately, especially as new activities and new products are introduced. Sometimes a change in a product or activity may expose an institution to new or different risks--the exotic new residential mortgages products in the United States are a good example. The supervisory community also needs to keep up with developments in banking and finance. We consider this vitally important because banking will remain a highly dynamic industry. Supervisors will have to be attentive to changing sound practices and ensure that new regulations do not unduly inhibit adoption of new banking practices and financial instruments. Our focus in this area is even more important as banking becomes increasingly complex and sophisticated and as banking systems become more concentrated. And with the advent of Basel II, supervisors are becoming even more involved in understanding the emerging best practices in risk measurement and management. Bridging the gap between internal capital measures and regulatory capital As I alluded, supervisors are focused on setting minimum levels of regulatory capital at individual banks that is sufficient for safety and soundness in the institution and the banking system more broadly. Successful individual financial institutions, on the other hand, generally strive for a higher level of capital that is tied to their individual circumstances and allows them to effectively implement their business strategies. As a result, the capital goals of supervisors and institutions are not necessarily identical (nor should they be)--but they are complementary. Even though the capital goals of regulators and bankers may differ, supervisors can still use the internal information produced by large, complex institutions to augment the risk-sensitivity and overall meaningfulness of regulatory capital measures. Basel II--particularly the advanced approaches--is an attempt to do just that. Increasingly, the measures produced by Basel I are no longer accurate representations of the risks to which large, complex institutions are exposed. These institutions have moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on the balance sheet to strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets and active management of risks. They have significant, complicated exposures off the books that need to be considered more explicitly in determining minimum regulatory capital. Among these are operational risks, which in some recent instances have been the source of substantial losses far exceeding credit- or market-related losses. Basel II, by tying regulatory capital to bank inputs, offers greater transparency about what stands behind the inputs provided by banks and exactly how they are calculated. As I noted earlier, successful institutions understand that calculating internal capital measures is a serious and challenging undertaking, with many moving parts. Supervisors, through their analysis of bank inputs to Basel II, will develop an even better assessment of institutions' risk-measurement and riskmanagement practices. Furthermore, the added transparency in Pillar NUM disclosures is expected to provide market participants with a better understanding of an institution's risks and its ability to manage them. Perhaps most importantly, Basel II's advanced approaches create a link between regulatory capital and risk management. Under these approaches, banks will be required to adopt more formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management procedures and processes. The new Accord's emphasis on improved risk management should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital standards, but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices to benefit the institution more broadly. While the new framework would, in our view, provide useful incentives for institutions to accelerate the improvement of risk management, we believe that in most areas of risk management institutions would retain their ability to choose among which specific methods they employ. In other words, we expect the standards in Basel II to be met in a number of ways, not just one. Supervisors will work to define an acceptable range of practice within which several types of bank approaches and methodologies could be used. Importantly, as risk-management practices improve over time, supervisors can assess each new innovation to see whether it indeed fits within the range of acceptable practice. And those innovations should, in turn, improve regulatory capital measures even further. So by design, the Basel II framework allows for flexibility and leaves open the possibility to include risk-management improvements not yet discovered. Analysis of recent Basel II data You are most likely aware that DATE the U.S. banking agencies conducted additional analysis of the initial results from DATE. The agencies were concerned that the results from DATE, conducted DATE, showed a wider dispersion and a larger overall drop in regulatory capital requirements for the DATE population of banks than the agencies had initially expected. The interagency analysis relating to DATE is essentially complete. From it we learned that the drop in DATE required minimum risk-based capital was largely due to the favorable point in the business cycle when the data were collected; while the previous QIS3 exercise was conducted with data from DATE, a higher credit loss year, DATE reflected the more benign credit conditions present in DATE. We learned that the dispersion among institutions was largely due to the varying risk parameters and methodologies they used, permissible in the DATE exercise, and also due to portfolio differences. That is, banks have different approaches to risk-management processes, and their models and databases reflect those differences--a point I will return to in just a moment. Importantly, we also learned that some of the data submitted by individual institutions was not complete; in some cases banks did not have estimates of loss in stress periods or used ad hoc estimates, which might have caused minimum regulatory capital to be underestimated. Generally, we realized that all institutions have additional work to do, but the findings did not point to insurmountable problems. Rather, they pointed to areas for future supervisory focus. In that way, the DATE analysis was critical in enabling us to move forward. In general, we were pleased to see that DATE showed that progress is being made toward developing more risk-sensitive capital measures. In fact, it was quite interesting to see the range of practice employed by institutions in developing their DATE estimates. As noted, a fair portion of the dispersion among institutions stemmed from their assignment of risk parameters, with differences in portfolio composition playing some role. The institutions participating in DATE use a variety of credit-rating systems. Rating philosophy is an area in which rating systems can differ, with some focused more on \"through the cycle\" ratings, and others on \"point in time\" ratings. Choices made in rating philosophy can have an impact on how assessments of risk translate into required capital. Additionally, it is quite interesting to see institutions continually working to upgrade their rating systems and incorporate innovations where possible; for example, many systems have recently been enhanced for greater granularity. So although work remains, we believe real strides are being made. In analyzing institutions' estimates of default probabilities, we saw that some firms used internal data, others external data, and some a combination of data sources. We also saw that differences in the use of reference data could affect capital outcomes. Similar results were seen with estimates of loss given default, as firms again used both internal and external data. Furthermore, we saw significant differences across banks in the discounting of recoveries, assumptions for workout costs, methods for incorporating downturn conditions (or lack thereof), and the treatment of collateral. These differences appear to have had significant effects on banks' loss given default estimates and to have contributed to the dispersion in required capital levels across firms. So what does it mean that institutions estimated different parameters for similar exposures? It could mean that not all practices are entirely robust or producing accurate results--understandable given that DATE was a done on a \"best efforts\" basis without close supervisory oversight, that the U.S. agencies need to issue their proposals, and that banks are still in the process of implementation. Differences in parameter estimates could also mean that institutions have varying interpretations of risks or methods to estimate those risks--all of which could be perfectly acceptable. In fact, DATE we see different interpretations and assessment of risks in financial markets as counterparties assume different probabilities of default, estimates of loss, or forecasts of prices. As you know, U.S. supervisors are still developing their Basel II proposals and associated supervisory guidance, so there are not yet any established standards for Basel II. In some cases, we were able to identify practices used for DATE that appeared to be clearly inconsistent with what is envisioned in the framework. In other cases, it was not easy to determine whether the practices used in DATE would be within the expected range of acceptable practice for U.S. Basel II standards. Clearly, one of the real challenges we will face as supervisors is to how to define the range of expected practice for Basel II standards, how to communicate that range to institutions, and how to deal with practices that are on the margin. Uncertainty about the expectations placed on institutions does not benefit supervisors or bankers. One of the key ways to reduce that uncertainty would be to continue our communication with the industry broadly, and with institutions individually, during the entire implementation process. Certainly, as we move closer to implementation, supervisory oversight of the Basel II implementation methodologies by our examination teams will increase. Indeed, during the qualification process, we expect to have several additional opportunities to evaluate institutions' risk-management processes, models, and estimates--and provide feedback to the institutions on their progress. So DATE, an assessment conducted at one point in time, should not be considered a complete forecast of institutions' future Basel II capabilities or the framework's ultimate effects. But DATE did give a very useful insight into the linkage between capital and risks, and how institutions are attempting to quantify that linkage. Indeed, it was one of the best glimpses we had to date. As we move forward with Basel II implementation, we expect to gather even more useful supervisory information about banks' progress in meeting Basel II standards, the potential impact of the framework, and, perhaps most importantly, banks' ability to measure and manage the risks to which they are exposed. As supervisors, we will highly value this opportunity to enhance our understanding of banking organizations, which we believe will promote safety and soundness in the banking system. Identifying and addressing home-host issues Given this extensive international audience, it might be helpful for me to offer the Federal Reserve's perspective of the so-called \"home-host\" aspects of Basel II implementation--a perspective that I believe is shared by my U.S. supervisory colleagues. First, we recognize that some may have concerns about the recent announcement by the U.S. agencies to implement Basel II with a DATE delay and with DATE of transitional floors. Understandably, internationally active organizations may worry that cross-border implementation will be complicated by the timing differences between the United States and other Basel member countries. While not downplaying potential challenges, the U.S. agencies, in deciding to adjust implementation plans, thought it was important to ensure that implementation in the United States be conducted in a prudential manner and without generating competitive inequalities in our banking markets. As we did before our DATE announcement of altered U.S. implementation plans, the U.S. banking agencies continue to work with institutions and foreign supervisors to minimize the difficulties in cross-border implementation. Our support includes extensive discussion with other countries in the Basel Accord Implementation Group, specifically formed to help address home-host implementation issues. We also have held numerous informal, bilateral discussions with institutions and foreign supervisors, and those will of course continue as implementation moves ahead. One should also remember all Basel-member countries have their own rollout timelines and national discretion issues, not just the United States--which is entirely appropriate. To assist institutions in resolving their crossborder challenges, we are eager to hear specifics from institutions so that we can develop targeted solutions. In addition, Basel-member countries continue to work on guidelines for institutions and supervisors, such as the recently issued consultative paper on home-host information sharing for Basel II. The paper is an attempt to set forth a practical way for home and host supervisors to ensure that they have sufficient information to assess Basel II compliance without being overly burdensome. It contains principles and guidelines, not prescriptive rules, because we do not see a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to information sharing. Instead, arrangements should be tailored to the unique circumstances of both the bank and the supervisors involved, and should be worked out by the supervisors involved on a case-by-case basis in a pragmatic manner. Additionally, the home-host paper emphasizes that information sharing within the bank itself is equally important. Local management of a banking subsidiary should understand and manage its risk profile, and should have access to information about Basel II implementation in its jurisdiction. Taking a step back, I think it is also helpful to remember that a number of the home-host issues pertaining to Basel II are actually variations of long-standing challenges faced by bankers and supervisors in the context of cross-border banking. That is, many of the issues under discussion are not necessarily new, but just made more complicated by the framework. The good news is that supervisors are already building upon their existing relationships to accommodate differences in national jurisdictions and minimize the burdens placed on banks. We believe the Federal Reserve has a long history of working constructively with other national supervisors in this manner. While such cooperation and information sharing can go a long way toward reducing the burden placed on bankers, at DATE we must realize that national jurisdictions still matter. We can work to harmonize differences, but it is probably not practical to try to eliminate them entirely. Conclusion Basel II provides a means for regulators to rely more on banks' internal estimates of risks--but only if those estimates meet certain supervisory standards. Our expectation is that Basel II will also promote further enhancements to risk management. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve considers Basel II to be a worthwhile undertaking and we look forward to its implementation. The recent DATE exercise in the United States provided valuable information about the Basel II framework and banks' progress in estimating more risk-sensitive regulatory capital measures. It also offered some sense of how institutions are implementing advanced risk- management practices more generally. As the Basel II implementation process moves along, we look forward to gathering additional information and further enhancing our understanding of institutions' practices.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: Enforcement of financial consumer protection laws Testimony of Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, DATE.    Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the Committee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve Board's ongoing efforts to address and prevent mortgage-related fraud and abusive lending practices in the institutions we supervise. While the expansion of the subprime mortgage market over DATE increased consumers' access to credit, too many homeowners and communities are suffering DATE because of lax underwriting standards and other unfair or deceptive practices that resulted in unsustainable loans. The Federal Reserve is committed to improving consumer protections and promoting responsible lending practices through each of the roles we play as supervisor for safety and soundness and consumer compliance, and as rulewriter. I will discuss the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts as a banking supervisor to ensure that the institutions we supervise are managing their mortgage lending activities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with laws and regulations. I will also discuss the rules and guidance that have been issued over DATE that address many of these issues. In addition to our own examination and enforcement activities, I will talk about our ongoing efforts to coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to hold those who are involved in criminal activities in our supervised institutions accountable. The Federal Reserve's enforcement efforts begin with the examination of its supervised institutions. The Federal Reserve conducts regular examinations of state member banks for both safety and soundness and compliance with consumer protection laws. We also conduct regular inspections of bank holding companies. We examine the mortgage businesses of these institutions, including subprime residential portfolios, as applicable. Institutions with weaknesses are expected to take corrective actions that include improving their risk management and underwriting practices in the future. In those rare instances where the bank is not willing to address the problem, we have and use a full range of powerful enforcement tools to compel corrective action. To ensure that banks with performance deficiencies give appropriate attention to supervisory concerns, we may require them to enter into nonpublic enforcement actions, such as memoranda of understanding. When necessary, we use formal, public enforcement actions, such as Written Agreements, Cease and Desist Orders, or civil money penalties. Mortgage fraud and investigations In DATE, there has been a significant increase in suspected criminal activity with respect to mortgage fraud and other mortgage-related criminal activity. Mortgage fraud occurs in various ways. In many cases mortgage fraud is perpetrated against the financial institution by brokers, appraisers, and other third parties. In other situations fraud is perpetrated by insiders of the institution. As I will discuss further, there are other abusive practices that occur in mortgage lending that harm borrowers and the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) that banking organizations are required to file reveal significant suspected mortgage fraud activity. As recently reported by FinCEN, there is a continuing upward trend of SARs filed by depository institutions involving suspected mortgage loan fraud.NUM From DATE, through DATE, depository institutions filed a total of NUM,NUM SARs reporting suspected mortgage loan fraud. This represents an increase of NUM percent in SARs involving mortgage fraud compared with DATE. During the reporting period, mortgage loan fraud was the third most reported activity in SARs. The top NUM filing institutions of mortgage loan fraud SARs submitted NUM percent of the total NUM,NUM SAR filings. SARs alleging mortgage fraud involve numerous varieties of conduct from largescale multi-million-dollar \"straw borrower\" and property flipping schemes to single incidents of overstated income or assets by individual borrowers. Federal Reserve staff regularly review SARs filed by the financial institutions the Fed supervises. When bank insiders may be involved, we initiate investigations, make referrals to law enforcement, coordinate with law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, and pursue enforcement actions against individuals, including seeking prohibition orders and, in appropriate cases, civil money penalties and restitution. We are pursuing numerous investigations involving insiders relating to possible mortgage-related fraud, both commercial and residential. The Federal Reserve has established a Federal Reserve System examiner group to share information on the detection of fraud and pending investigations. On the local level, Reserve Bank staff also interacts with representatives from law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and other agencies in SAR \"review teams\" to review SARs and coordinate actions. These meetings provide an opportunity to share information about criminal activities, including mortgage fraud, occurring within the district. The Federal Reserve regularly coordinates with law enforcement in a number of ways. Staff participates in DATE interagency meetings led by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Fraud Section and attended by other law enforcement and regulatory agencies. This interagency group, the \"Bank Fraud Working Group,\" discusses and shares information on recent cases, trends, and other issues, including mortgage fraud. Supervision examinations and enforcement In the Federal Reserve's regular safety and soundness examinations of state member banks and bank holding companies, we evaluate risk-management systems, financial condition, and compliance with laws and regulations. In assessing a bank's risk management systems for its mortgage lending activity, examiners evaluate the adequacy of the bank's practices to identify, manage, and control credit risk. This includes the appropriateness of the bank's underwriting standards, credit administration, quality control processes over its own originations and third-party originations, and appraisal and collateral valuation practices. To assist institutions in understanding our supervisory expectations, the Federal Reserve has supplemented its long-standing guidelines on safe and sound real estate lending practices by joining the other federal bank regulatory agencies in issuing additional guidance on mortgage lending practices. Specifically, starting in DATE, the Federal Reserve and the other federal agencies observed that lenders were increasingly originating nontraditional mortgage loans that lacked principal amortization and had the potential for negative amortization. We were also concerned about the growing use of adjustable rate mortgage products with \"teaser\" rates that adjust to a variable rate plus a margin for the remaining term of the loan, in addition to other risky characteristics. These products could result in payment shock to borrowers, and present heightened risks to lenders and borrowers. Moreover, the easing of underwriting standards and the marketing of these products to lower credit quality borrowers, including those purchasing investment properties, held the potential to create significant risks for institutions and for borrowers. To address those concerns and prevent supervised institutions from making unaffordable mortgage loans, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies issued the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products Risks in DATE and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending in DATE. The nontraditional mortgage guidance highlights sound underwriting procedures, portfolio risk management, and consumer protection practices that institutions should follow to prudently originate and manage mortgage loans with payment option and interest-only features. A key aspect of both statements is the recommendation that a lender's analysis of repayment capacity should include an evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay debt. The subprime guidance emphasizes the risks of stated income or reduced documentation loans in the subprime sector. Further, the subprime guidance outlines certain practices that are considered predatory in nature and stipulates that institutions should not engage in these practices regardless of loan features. Also, in DATE the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies issued the Interagency Guidance on Independent Appraisal and Evaluation Functions. This statement reinforces the importance of appraiser independence from the loan origination and credit decision process to ensure that valuations are fairly and appropriately determined. Independence has been a core principle in the Board's appraisal regulation and guidance, which have been in place since DATE. When we examine a bank's real estate lending activities, examiners consider the adequacy of the appraisal function to ensure that it complies with the appraisal regulation and has appropriate risk management practices. A strong appraisal function is essential to combating the potential for mortgage fraud by protecting the collateral valuations from influence by individuals whose intent is to deceive the lender about the condition and value of the collateral. The agencies took steps to further strengthen their guidance in this area by proposing interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines DATE. More recently, the collapse of the global credit market, triggered by the end of housing booms in the United States and other countries and the associated problems in mortgage markets, has led to a deterioration of asset values and credit conditions. As a result, financial institutions have incurred losses that in and of themselves have caused financial institutions to tighten credit underwriting standards to ensure that borrowers have the capacity to repay. Furthermore, sweeping new rules issued by the Board under its authority in the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) will further ensure that mortgage lenders that offer high-cost mortgages have appropriate practices to ensure consumers can repay their loans. Consumer compliance examination and enforcement The Federal Reserve conducts regular examinations of state member banks to evaluate compliance with consumer protection laws, the fair lending laws, and the Community Reinvestment Act. These examinations are conducted by a specially trained cadre of examiners for the approximately NUM banks we supervise. The Board has a long-standing commitment to ensuring that every bank it supervises complies fully with federal financial consumer protection laws, including the fair lending laws. The scope of these examinations includes a review of the bank's compliance with the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), the Community Reinvestment Act, and other federal consumer protection laws. One objective of our consumer compliance examination program is to identify compliance risks at banks before they harm consumers and ensure that state member banks have appropriate controls in place to manage those risks. In conducting a consumer compliance examination at a state member bank, examiners review the commitment and ability of bank management to comply with consumer protection laws as well as the bank's actual compliance with such laws. Examinations follow a risk-focused approach tailored to fit the risk profile of the bank. This approach directs supervisory attention and resources to the products, services, and areas of the bank's operations that pose the greatest risk to consumers. Our examiners prepare a stand-alone consumer compliance examination report bearing a distinct consumer compliance rating for each state member bank we supervise. These confidential reports include an evaluation of the bank's compliance management program, a summary of the fair lending review, and a discussion of violations of consumer laws and regulations. When examiners identify banks with weak and ineffective compliance programs, they document the weaknesses in the examination report and take appropriate supervisory action. Banks with a poor record of compliance are examined more frequently than those with favorable records. When necessary to obtain compliance with consumer protection laws, we can, and do, use our enforcement tools, ranging from nonpublic actions to public Cease and Desist Orders. However, most banks voluntarily address any violations and weaknesses in consumer compliance management programs that our examiners identify so we find public formal actions are not typically necessary. Important tools for examiners and financial institutions are guidance and examination procedures for enforcing the Federal Trade Commission Act's prohibition of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices by State-Chartered Banks issued by the Board and the FDIC in DATE outlines strategies for banks to use to avoid engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, to minimize their own risks and to protect consumers. Among other things, the guidance focuses on loan servicing and managing and monitoring creditors' employees and third-party service providers. The Federal Reserve's consumer compliance supervision authority extends to bank holding companies as well as to state member banks. In DATE, banking organizations have greatly expanded the scope, complexity, and innovation of their business activities. At the same time, compliance requirements associated with these activities have become more complex. To assist financial institutions in addressing these challenges, the Federal Reserve recently issued guidance in DATE clarifying its expectations regarding firm-wide compliance risk management and oversight for both prudential and consumer protection supervision in Complex Risk Management Programs and Oversight at Large Banking Organizations with Complex Compliance Profiles. Further, Federal Reserve consumer compliance examiners routinely participate in the review and assessment of the adequacy of large bank holding company compliance risk management programs. In addition to its own supervisory efforts related to bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve, along with the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and a number of state authorities, recently completed a pilot consumer protection compliance review as part of an interagency project to enhance the supervision of subprime mortgage lenders. Under the pilot project, the agencies coordinated to conduct consumer-protection compliance reviews at selected entities with significant subprime mortgage operations. The reviews included independent state-licensed mortgage lenders, nondepository mortgage lending subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with or serving as agents of these entities. These reviews included targeted evaluations of mortgage underwriting standards, risk management strategies, and compliance with certain consumer protection laws. We are currently assessing the results of the pilot project. The results will guide the Board's decisionmaking as to how it may supervise these entities in the future. Focus on fair lending enforcement Although the Federal Reserve's fair lending enforcement program is not intended to detect mortgage fraud, it is a vital component of the Federal Reserve's efforts to ensure fair access to responsible credit. The Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that every bank it supervises complies fully with the federal fair lending laws, the ECOA and the Fair Housing Act. Every consumer compliance examination includes an evaluation of the bank's fair lending compliance program, as well as an assessment of the bank's fair lending risk across all types of lending, including mortgage lending. Examiners also test the institution's actual lending record for specific types of discrimination, such as pricing discrimination in mortgage lending. A specialized Fair Lending Enforcement Section on the Board's staff works closely with staff at the NUM Reserve Banks across the country to provide guidance on fair lending matters and to ensure that the fair lending laws are enforced rigorously. When examiners find fair lending violations, the Board takes appropriate supervisory action. If we have reason to believe that an institution has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination under the ECOA, the Board, like other federal banking agencies, has a statutory responsibility under the Act to refer the matter to the DOJ, which reviews the referral and decides if further investigation is warranted. A DOJ investigation may result in a public civil enforcement action or settlement. The DOJ may instead return the matter to the Federal Reserve for administrative enforcement. When this occurs, we ensure that the institution takes all appropriate corrective action. If a fair lending violation does not constitute a pattern or practice, we similarly ensure that the bank takes all appropriate corrective action. In carrying out our supervisory responsibilities related to fair lending, Federal Reserve examiners perform many reviews to detect pricing discrimination, redlining, and steering in mortgage lending. These illegal practices can limit fair access to responsible credit, and make it more likely that minorities will fall prey to potentially abusive lending practices. Several of these reviews have resulted in referrals to the DOJ. In DATE, we have referred fifteen matters to the DOJ and four of these matters have involved illegal discrimination in mortgage lending based on race or ethnicity. The Board referred two nationwide mortgage lenders to the DOJ because we determined that Hispanic and African-American borrowers paid more for their loans than comparable non-Hispanic white borrowers. These reviews resulted from a process of targeted reviews for mortgage pricing discrimination that the Federal Reserve initiated when the mortgage pricing data became available under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. We also referred a lender for imposing a restriction on rowhouse lending that resulted in discrimination against African Americans. Finally, we referred a lender for redlining. The lender's marketing strategy was based on negative racial stereotypes and, as a result, excluded a cluster of minority neighborhoods from its lending activity. Rules banning unfair and deceptive practices In addition to our supervisory activities, the Federal Reserve Board in DATE finalized sweeping new rules for home mortgage loans to better protect consumers and facilitate responsible residential mortgage lending. The rules, which amend Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), were adopted under HOEPA, and prohibit unfair, abusive or deceptive home mortgage lending practices and restrict certain other mortgage practices. Importantly, the rules apply to all mortgage lenders, not just depository institutions supervised by the federal banking and thrift regulators. These rules resulted from a series of field hearings conducted by the Board in DATE and DATE and a review of approximately NUM,NUM comment letters representing a broad spectrum of views that were received in response to the Board's proposed rule issued in December DATE. The final rule adds four key protections for a newly defined category of \"higher-priced mortgage loans\" secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The higher-priced thresholds adopted by the Board would cover all, or virtually all, of the subprime market and a portion of the Alt-A market. For loans in this category, these protections will prohibit a lender from making a loan without regard to a borrower's ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the home's value. Second, lenders are prohibited from making \"stated income\" loans and are required in each case to verify the income and assets they rely upon to determine borrowers' repayment ability. Third, the rules restrict the use of prepayment penalties in cases where the borrower could encounter payment shock. Finally, creditors are required to establish an escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for all first-lien mortgage loans. In addition to rules for higher-cost loans, the Board adopted other protections that apply to all mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling, regardless of the cost. The rules prohibit lenders or brokers from coercing, influencing or otherwise encouraging an appraiser to misstate or misrepresent the value of the property. The rules also prohibit, among other things, servicers from engaging in certain unfair practices. I note that the Board is working on another important rulemaking action with other federal agencies and state organizations to implement the registration requirements for residential mortgage loan originators employed by federally supervised institutions, as required by the S.A.F.E. Mortgaging Licensing Act of DATE (SAFE Act). The SAFE Act, when implemented, will provide for increased accountability and tracking of loan originators in a publicly accessible database. Under the SAFE Act, an individual is prohibited from engaging in loan origination without obtaining and maintaining DATE a unique identifier and either a license and registration as a state-licensed loan originator or a registration as a federal loan originator. Prevention and future challenges The Federal Reserve will continue to take actions against institutions that violate consumer protection or fair lending laws, engage in unfair or deceptive practices, or otherwise engage in unsafe or unsound lending practices. We will continue to focus on strong supervision to prevent the occurrence of these practices and violations. In addition to our own examination and enforcement activities, we will continue our efforts to coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to hold those who are involved in our supervised institutions accountable for criminal activities related to mortgage lending. Again, I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss what the Federal Reserve does to address and prevent mortgage-related fraud and abusive lending practices in the institutions we supervise.",

The mortgage market has long been a source of strength in the U.S. economy, but it is facing significant challenges, especially in the subprime segment that serves consumers who have shorter or weaker credit records. As of DATE, DATE for which data are available, about NUM percent of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were DATE delinquent, twice the level DATE earlier.NUM More than NUM,NUM foreclosures were started on these mortgages in DATE, up NUM percent from the previous quarter.NUM The significance of the problems with subprime loan performance is evident in the unusually high rate of defaults within DATE of loan origination, known as early payment defaults. In DATE, nearly NUM percent of subprime ARMs originated in DATE were already DATE delinquent, twice the rate of DATE and nearly four times the rate DATE earlier.NUM These problems have many causes, but the role of abusive lending practices is of particular concern. Such practices have led many people into homeownership that they cannot sustain, hurting their families as well as their neighbors and communities. Practices that have hurt consumers have also undermined the confidence of investors and contributed to a virtual shutdown of the subprime market. As a result, it is difficult for many borrowers, especially those with shorter or weaker credit records, to obtain home loans. These events have highlighted the shared interest of mortgage borrowers, their communities, lenders, and investors in protecting borrowers from abusive practices and preserving their choices. Abusive loans that strip their equity or cause them to lose their homes must not be tolerated. Protecting borrowers with responsible underwriting standards also protects the integrity and proper functioning of the mortgage market by increasing investor confidence. In other words, effective consumer protection can reduce uncertainty about the underwriting standards of, and hence, the value of, loans in mortgage-backed securities, thereby helping to revive and strengthen mortgage securities markets. In this way, effective consumer protection produces a complementary benefit for consumers by making more capital available to meet their needs. Similarly, systematic efforts to keep borrowers who may have trouble meeting their loan obligations in their homes on a sustainable basis, by providing more certainty to the market, can have the complementary benefit of ensuring the flow of capital for potential borrowers. With these principles in mind, I will discuss current initiatives to mitigate foreclosures. Then I will spend most of my time discussing the Board's recent initiative in proposing new regulations to prevent abuse, unfairness, and deception in residential mortgage lending. Preventing unnecessary foreclosures About one-and-a-half million adjustable-rate subprime mortgages are scheduled to have their interest rates reset DATE--significantly more than in DATE--and another one-half million in DATE. While many borrowers facing reset will be able to make the higher payment, many will not. As rates reset, it is important that we take steps to protect homeowners, communities, the mortgage market, and the economy from the adverse consequences of unnecessary defaults and foreclosures. Given the high cost of foreclosures to lenders and investors and the disruption and distress that foreclosure can cause to consumers, their families, and their communities, it is in everyone's interest to avoid foreclosures whenever other viable options exist. With large numbers of borrowers facing potential repayment problems, it is in the interest of borrowers and investors alike for the industry to develop prudent loan modification programs and other assistance to help borrowers on a systematic and sustainable basis. The American Securitization Forum (ASF) and the Hope Now Alliance have recognized this interest and have taken leading roles in streamlining the process for refinancing and modifying subprime adjustable-rate mortgages. I have been an active proponent of such streamlined systematic approaches to reduce transactions costs and to help mitigate foreclosure risk, and I strongly encourage market participants to adopt and to implement these fast-track modification proposals as quickly as possible. The efforts by ASF and Hope Now have helped accelerate loan modifications in DATE, according to recently released data. I applaud these efforts but more must be done as the number of households facing resets increases. Challenges remain, for example, with respect to ongoing constraints on servicing capacity to expedite work outs. Servicers must undertake the investment to overcome the capacity challenges and provide transparent and timely measures of the results. A systematic and prudent effort to avoid unnecessary foreclosures has many benefits. Many borrowers with subprime ARMs, for example, have been able to strengthen their credit records by making timely payments so far. It would be very unfortunate if some of these borrowers faced foreclosure when their payments increased merely because servicers lacked the capacity to reach them in time with a sustainable alternative. The solid credit history would be lost and, consequently, financing options would be reduced. Loan-by-loan modifications can help some, but they require substantial time and effort. Where appropriate, an efficient, systematic approach lets servicers reach more of these borrowers and prevent more foreclosures. Furthermore, as noted above, standards for dealing with problem loans may help make more capital available for potential borrowers. By providing more certainty to the mortgage market, clear and consistent standards can help ensure the flow of credit to potential borrowers. While much has been done to prevent avoidable foreclosures, more still needs to be done. For our part, the Federal Reserve has been working with financial institutions and community groups around the country to address the challenges posed by problem loans. For instance, we have been providing community coalitions, counseling agencies, fellow regulators, and others with detailed analyses identifying neighborhoods at high risk of foreclosures. In addition, all twelve of the Federal Reserve Banks have also been working with an array of stakeholders to address these challenges on the local and regional levels. There are also efforts under way on the international level to develop responses to recent financial market turmoil. I represent the Board on the Financial Stability Forum, which has established a working group to diagnose causes of recent events and make recommendations. The Board's proposal I will now focus on the Board's recent proposal for stricter regulations prohibiting abusive and deceptive practices in the mortgage market under authority of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). This proposal is intended to protect consumers and to preserve consumer choice by targeting protections to borrowers who face the most risk. The proposed regulations are designed to protect consumers from excessive layering of risk even as the practices that increase risk may change. We have sought to ensure that these standards are clear for lenders to reduce unintended consequences for consumers. Though clear, the standards are intended to be not overly prescriptive, so as to preserve access to responsible credit while amply protecting consumers. Our proposal is also comprehensive, covering most mortgage loans with certain protections and the entire subprime market with certain more specific regulations. While comprehensive, the proposal would focus protections where the risks are greatest and preserve consumers' access to responsible credit. Our effort to produce robust, clear, and comprehensive rules was based on a rigorous analysis of available qualitative and quantitative data. We have put this proposal out for public comment until DATE and eagerly seek suggestions to be able to craft the best possible final rule. Comprehensive scope Let me say more about the comprehensive scope of this proposal. It would apply stricter regulations to higher-priced mortgage loans, which we have defined broadly. We were particularly interested in ensuring that protections remain strong over time as loan products and lending practices change. Our analysis of the data suggested that the troubles in the mortgage market generally arise not from a single practice in isolation, but instead from the complex ways that risk factors and underwriting practices can affect each other, sometimes called \"risk layering.\" Therefore, we have proposed using a loan's DATE percentage rate, or APR, to determine whether the loan is covered by stricter regulations.NUM Because the APR is closely correlated to risk, the proposed protections would cover loans with higher risks rather than single out particular risk factors or underwriting practices. With the APR thresholds we have proposed, we expect that the new protections would cover the entire subprime mortgage market and the riskier end of the \"near prime\" market, the latter also known as the \"alt-A\" market. Covering part of the alt-A market would anticipate possible actions by lenders to avoid restrictions on subprime loans priced near the threshold. It would also address real risks to consumers in the alt-A segment. This segment grew very rapidly, and it layered risks, such as undocumented income, on top of other risks, such as nontraditional loan structures allowing borrowers to defer paying principal and interest. Our public hearings and our analysis identified problems not just in higher-priced loans, however, but in the broader mortgage market. Thus, our proposal addresses unfair or deceptive practices for the vast majority of mortgage loans secured by a consumer's primary home. Areas targeted this broadly include broker steering, appraisal coercion, unwarranted servicing fees, and deceptive advertising. I'll touch on broker steering toward the end of my remarks. Robust approach to affordability Extending credit that borrowers can afford to repay is a fundamental pillar of responsible lending. Across the whole range of higher-priced mortgage loans, our proposal offers three rules that, working in combination, would help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. First is a requirement that a lender maintain responsible underwriting practices that genuinely assess borrowers' ability to repay. This general requirement would be complemented by a specific requirement to verify borrowers' income and assets. A third rule would require lenders to escrow property taxes and homeowners insurance to help borrowers meet these obligations. This robust approach to affordability would help ensure that the subprime market promotes sustainable homeownership. Just as important, it would also help protect consumers from abuse. When the law requires that DATE payments be affordable, then consumers are less vulnerable to abusive refinancings that strip equity. When the law imposes a responsible underwriting standard on all lenders, then irresponsible actors who would strip borrowers' equity are easier to keep out of the market. Clear lending standards have the further advantages of increasing investor confidence in the mortgage market and helping to revive the flow of credit flow to consumers with shorter or weaker credit records. Assessment of repayment ability Now I want to discuss the major elements of our proposed regulations for higher-priced loans in a little more depth, starting with the requirement to assess repayment ability. The regulations would prohibit a lender from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higherpriced loans based on the value of the borrower's house rather than on the borrower's ability to repay from income, or from assets other than the house. This prohibition is intentionally broad to capture all risks to loan performance and the different ways that these risks can be layered. Moreover, the proposal avoids prescribing quantitative underwriting requirements. For example, the proposal would prohibit a pattern or practice of disregarding the ratio of applicants' income to their debt, but it does not prescribe a maximum ratio because the appropriate number depends heavily on other risk factors, which vary from loan to loan. At the same time, the proposal does offer specifics. For example, it would create a presumption that a lender had violated the regulations if it engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to underwrite at the fully-indexed rate.NUM This presumption is derived from the subprime guidance the agencies issued DATE. It bears emphasis, however, that our proposed regulations would be more robust and comprehensive than the guidance. The regulations would apply to all mortgage lenders, including independent mortgage companies. Guidance, in contrast, does not ensure uniformity of coverage. Moreover, the regulations would be legally enforceable by supervisory and enforcement agencies. Just as important, the regulations, unlike the guidance, would be legally enforceable by consumers. Borrowers who brought timely actions could recover statutory damages for violations, above and beyond any actual damages they suffered. The proposed requirement to assess repayment ability is intended to protect consumers from abusive practices while maintaining their access to responsible credit. We recognize that satisfying both objectives at the same time is a challenge. The proposed rule's potential for consumer actions, coupled with its careful avoidance of prescribing quantitative underwriting thresholds, could raise compliance and litigation risk. In turn, this could raise the cost of credit for higher-risk borrowers or limit the availability of responsible credit. That is why we have proposed prohibiting a \"pattern or practice\" of disregarding repayment ability rather than attaching a risk of legal liability to every individual loan that does not perform. This approach is meant to preserve choices for borrowers with shorter or weaker credit records while protecting them from lenders who have a practice of disregarding repayment ability or are found to exhibit a pattern of unaffordable loans. We anticipate vigorous comment on our proposed approach and have specifically solicited suggestions for its implementation. Income verification When we looked closely at why so many borrowers had mortgages that they struggled to repay so soon after taking out the loan, the prevalence of \"stated-income\" lending was a clear culprit. Substantial anecdotal evidence indicates that failing to verify income invited fraud. Moreover, when we looked at the loan-level data we saw a clear correlation between \"low-doc\" or \"no-doc\" lending and performance problems, particularly early payment defaults. That is why we have proposed to complement a broad requirement to assess repayment ability with a specific requirement to verify the income or assets a lender relies on to make a credit decision. We recognize that stated-income lending may have a proper place when not layered on top of too many other risks. Indeed, stated income lending and \"no/low-doc\" lending are defining features of the alt-A market, which has long served borrowers with good credit scores who seek some underwriting flexibility. We would target the verification requirement to higher-priced loans, including the higher-priced end of the alt-A market, where the risks of stated-income lending could be layered on top of too many other risks. This targeting is intended to maintain consumer access to responsible credit. The proposal identifies standard documents that would be acceptable, such as W-NUM forms. It also allows, however, any third party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of income. This rule is meant to preserve consumer choice by allowing the market to identify credible nontraditional documentation of consumer income--for example, check-cashing receipts. In that regard, the proposal responds to input we gathered through the HOEPA hearing I chaired DATE. Several panelists spoke of the fact that some consumers may have access to only nonstandard documents and others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs, may have some difficulty documenting their income. To help ensure that the proposal preserves access to credit for the full range of consumers, we have sought public comment on this issue. Escrows for taxes and insurance Another part of our proposal for higher-priced loans--a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance--would also help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. Escrowing has become standard practice in the prime market, and the case for making it standard in the subprime market, too, appears compelling. Consumers with shorter or weaker credit histories may be less likely to appreciate the sizable burden that taxes and insurance can add to the cost of homeownership, or more vulnerable to being misled by payment quotes that leave out these amounts. Moreover, when we looked at the data, we saw in the unusually high level of early payment defaults possible evidence that the lack of escrows hurt consumers who did not have experience paying property tax and insurance bills. We have proposed to address the problem with a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance on higher-priced loans, accompanied by a limited allowance for opt-out. We wanted the regulations to prevent irresponsible efforts to encourage borrowers to opt out. So the rule would not permit opt-out at the closing table, but instead would require that DATE pass before a consumer may opt out. In this respect the proposal is intended to preserve consumer choice while protecting consumers from unaffordable mortgage obligations. Prepayment penalties Having discussed the rules that would promote affordability, I want to say a word about our proposed rule on prepayment penalties. These penalties can take a toll on consumers who have riskier loans, and many consumers may not even be aware their loans have a penalty. Accordingly, we have proposed a ban on prepayment penalties in circumstances of a high degree of risk to the consumer, and we are also addressing transparency concerns. The proposed rule would ban prepayment penalties where they are most likely to prevent a consumer from refinancing a loan that has a particularly burdensome payment. Specifically, a penalty would be prohibited where the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds NUM percent, and a penalty would have to expire before a loan's payment could increase. The rule would also ban prepayment penalties where they are more likely to be part of a \"loan flipping\" scheme--specifically, where a lender or its affiliate refinances the lender's own loan. An approach tailored to the degree of risk to the consumer appears to us to be in the best interest of consumers overall. Banning penalties altogether could cause all borrowers, including those who do not prepay, to bear the full cost of investors' prepayment risk. That result would raise questions of fairness, and it could reduce consumer choice. We share concerns, however, that consumers often do not knowingly choose loans with penalties. We are tackling those concerns head-on. Through rigorous consumer testing, we are developing a new disclosure for prepayment penalties to improve consumer awareness and understanding. This should empower consumers to make better informed choices and improve competition. Steering I have so far discussed the elements of our proposal that would seek to ensure that underwriting practices and loan terms on higher-priced loans do not present unwarranted risks to consumers. There is another potential source of risk to consumers that I want to address that is related to \"steering\"--the risk that when they use the services of a mortgage broker, they do not appreciate the extent to which the broker's interests may diverge from the consumer's interests because of \"yield spread premiums.\"NUM The growth of the market for brokerage services has no doubt increased competition in the market for mortgage loans, to the benefit of consumers. Moreover, the yield spread premium, a payment from a lender to a broker based on the loan's interest rate, is sometimes the best way for a consumer to fund the cost of a broker's services. However, when a lender pays a broker for a loan that has a higher rate, that payment can create a conflict of interest between the broker and the consumer. This conflict is problematic if the consumer does not know it exists or assumes, incorrectly, that the broker is obligated to put the consumer's interests first. In such cases, the consumer cannot protect his or her own interests, and competition for loans and for brokerage services does not work effectively. Therefore, we have proposed to prohibit a lender, for both prime and subprime loans, from paying a broker any more than the consumer had expressly agreed that the broker would receive. This agreement must be executed up-front, before the consumer has submitted an application and become invested in closing the deal. The combination of stricter regulation and better disclosure that we are proposing should help reduce a broker's incentive to steer a consumer to a higher rate, empower consumers to shop and negotiate among brokers, and preserve consumers' option to use the services of a broker. Better and earlier information for consumers Lastly, to protect consumers and promote competition, our proposed regulation would prohibit misleading mortgage advertising and require that consumers receive loan-specific disclosures early in the application process, when they can use the information to shop more effectively. We recognize, however, that we face a challenge in ensuring that disclosures for mortgage loans remain effective. We have begun a comprehensive program of rigorous consumer testing of potential improvements to current disclosures. Conclusion There are more elements of our comprehensive proposal that I do not have time DATE to discuss, such as a prohibition against coercing appraisers and restrictions on unwarranted servicing fees. We anticipate vigorous public comment on this proposal, and once we have carefully considered all the input we receive, we will move expeditiously to a final rule. As I noted at the outset, effective consumer protection can help to restore confidence in the mortgage markets and help to preserve the flow of capital to consumers who wish to purchase a home. It is not too early to emphasize that the effectiveness of the final rule will depend critically on effective enforcement. The Federal Reserve will do its part to ensure compliance among the institutions it supervises. We also have been instrumental in launching a pilot project with other federal and state agencies to conduct consumer compliance reviews of non-depository lenders and other industry participants. I am sure we will be aided in these efforts by a new system for registering and tracking mortgage brokers recently launched by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. While we work to build effective consumer protections and enforcement regimes for future consumers, we will also continue our efforts, and encourage the initiatives many others are undertaking, to limit unnecessary foreclosures for consumers who are hurting now.",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Columbia Business School's 32nd DATE Dinner, New York, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    President Bollinger, Dean Hubbard, Co-Chairman Kravis, and distinguished guests, I am very pleased to be here and especially honored to receive the Columbia Business School's Distinguished Leadership in Government Award. TIME I would like to offer a few thoughts on mortgage markets and the recent increase in the pace of delinquencies and foreclosures. My particular focus will be on geographic variation in mortgage performance and how that variation can help us better understand and prevent foreclosures. I will also discuss some initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve to address the foreclosure crisis as well as other policies that might be used to strengthen mortgage and housing markets. Geographic variation in loan mortgage performance As my listeners know, conditions in mortgage markets remain quite difficult, and mortgage delinquencies have climbed steeply. The sharpest increases have been among subprime mortgages, particularly those with adjustable interest rates: About one quarter of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages are currently DATE or more delinquent or in foreclosure.NUM Delinquency rates also have increased in the prime and near-prime segments of the mortgage market, although not nearly so much as in the subprime sector. As a consequence of rising delinquencies, foreclosure proceedings were initiated on some NUM million U.S. homes during DATE, up NUM percent from DATE, and the rate of foreclosure starts looks likely to be yet higher in DATE. Not all foreclosure starts result in the borrower's loss of the home; sometimes the borrower is able to make up the missed payments or other arrangements are made with the lender. But, given the number of borrowers in distress and the weakness of the general housing market, the share of foreclosure initiations that ultimately result in the loss of the home seems likely to be higher in the current episode than customarily has been the case. Many foreclosures are not preventable. Investors, for example, are unlikely to want to hold onto a property whose value has depreciated significantly, and some borrowers - perhaps because they were put into an inappropriate loan or because personal circumstances have changed - cannot realistically sustain homeownership. However, if a foreclosure is preventable, and the borrower wants to stay in the home, the economic case for trying to avoid foreclosure is strong. Because foreclosures impose high costs, including legal and administrative costs as well as the costs of leaving the property vacant for a possibly extended period, both the borrower and the lender often are better off avoiding foreclosure. Moreover, it is important to recognize that the costs of foreclosure may extend well beyond those borne directly by the borrower and the lender. Clusters of foreclosures can destabilize communities, reduce the property values of nearby homes, and lower municipal tax revenues. At both the local and national levels, foreclosures add to the stock of homes for sale, increasing downward pressure on home prices in general. In the current environment, more-rapid declines in house prices may have an adverse impact on the broader economy and, through their effects on the valuation of mortgage-related assets, on the stability of the financial system. Thus, finding ways to avoid preventable foreclosures is a legitimate and important concern of public policy. To determine the appropriate public- and private-sector responses to the rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, we need to better understand the sources of this phenomenon. In good times and bad, a mortgage default can be triggered by a life event, such as the loss of a job, serious illness or injury, or divorce. However, another factor is now playing an increasing role in many markets: declines in home values, which reduce homeowners' equity and may consequently affect their ability or incentive to make the financial sacrifices necessary to stay in their homes. On the principle that a picture is worth a thousand words, Federal Reserve staff, using detailed, county-by-county information on mortgage performance, have developed a series of \"heat maps,\" which summarize the incidence of serious mortgage delinquencies across the nation as well as some of the key drivers of loan performance. As the examples will make clear, the figures use warmer colors - orange and red - to show counties for which the factor being considered has a higher value or change. Lower values or changes are indicated by cooler colors - shades of green - and yellows indicate areas where the factor under consideration has a moderate value or change. Nationally, as of the fourth quarter of DATE, the rate of serious delinquency, as measured by credit records, stood at NUM percent of all mortgage borrowers, up nearly NUM percent from the end of DATE.NUM DATE is a useful benchmark, because general economic conditions were fairly normal and the lax underwriting that emerged later was not yet evident. Figure NUM shows the national patterns of serious mortgage delinquency in DATE, which, again, I am taking as representative of a relatively normal period, with orange and red indicating the highest rates of delinquency and greens indicating the lowest. In DATE, the areas of the country with the highest rates of serious delinquency included significant portions of the Southeast; parts of the Midwest, most notably Ohio and Indiana; portions of the Rocky Mountain region; and Texas, Oklahoma, and areas in the Mississippi valley. In contrast, many parts of the country experienced exceptionally good loan performance at that time, including most of the West Coast, New England, and much of southern Florida. However, conditions in some areas changed greatly in a relatively short period of time. Figure NUM shows the pattern of delinquency rates as of the last quarter of DATE. Many of the areas that exhibited elevated delinquency rates in DATE continued to show relatively high rates of delinquency in DATE. But some areas that had low rates in DATE experienced high rates DATE. Figure NUM makes this point more sharply by showing the pattern of increases in delinquency rates between DATE and DATE, with the largest increases shown in red. The strong regional pattern is evident in the figure. Although many parts of the country have seen significant increases in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, a number of areas - such as California, parts of Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, portions of the upper Midwest, and New England - have been particularly hard hit. The regional pattern of the recent rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures requires explanation. Again, we can use heat maps to examine the underlying relationships across geographic regions between changes in mortgage delinquency rates and factors identified as driving loan performance. For example, the change in the unemployment rate in a county can be used as a proxy for disruptions in family incomes and subsequent financial stress. Figure NUM shows changes in average DATE unemployment rates across counties between DATE and DATE, with counties indicated in red experiencing the largest increases in joblessness.NUM The data suggest that increases in unemployment rates account for at least some of the recent increases in mortgage delinquencies. Parts of New England, states in the Great Lakes region - including Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin - and a number of other states, such as Nevada, show both increased mortgage delinquencies and notable increases in unemployment rates. However, the behavior of unemployment does not seem sufficient to explain the increased delinquency rates in other areas, including California, Florida, and portions of Colorado, where mortgage delinquencies increased during a period in which unemployment generally decreased. Another important determinant of loan performance, identified by research at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, is changes in house prices.NUM Figure NUM shows the regional pattern of changes in house prices between DATE and DATE, with the sharpest price declines indicated in reds and oranges.NUM The figure shows that Florida, California, Nevada, Michigan, and parts of New Mexico and Colorado experienced decreases in house prices between the fourth quarter of DATE and the fourth quarter of DATE (a pattern which has continued and intensified in DATE).NUM As I noted, sharp declines in house prices, and thus in homeowners' equity, reduce both the ability and incentive of homeowners, particularly those under financial stress for other reasons, to retain their homes. Other factors affect foreclosure rates, and once again the heat maps can give us a visual impression. Figure NUM shows the share of home purchases by non-owner occupiers - investors or purchasers of vacation homes, for example - during DATE and DATE.NUM Again, there is some correlation with the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures, as purchases by non-owner occupiers were relatively high in the West, Southwest, and in Florida. Figure NUM shows the incidence of junior liens (or piggyback loans), often an indicator of little borrower equity at the time of purchase. The greater use of these mortgages in the West and East Coasts presumably reflects higher house prices in those regions; again, the geographical pattern suggests that the use of piggyback loans may also have contributed to the recent rise in delinquencies and foreclosures.NUM What are the implications of these relationships, particularly the linkage of mortgage payment problems and falling house prices? Loan servicers are used to dealing with mortgage delinquencies related to life events such as unemployment or illness, with the most common approaches being a temporary repayment plan or the folding of missed payments into the principal balance. A widespread decline in home prices, by contrast, is a relatively novel phenomenon, and lenders and servicers will have to develop new and flexible strategies to deal with this issue. In some cases, when the source of the problem is a decline of the value of the home well below the mortgage's principal balance, the best solution may be a writedown of principal or other permanent modification of the loan by the servicer, perhaps combined with a refinancing by the Federal Housing Administration or another lender. To be NUM Unemployment rate data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. NUM For example, see Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen (DATE). NUM Displayed is the DATE percentage change in the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight price index for each county from the end of DATE to the end of DATE. NUM Several different series measure home price changes. The index compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight uses the values of homes whose mortgages were purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. NUM Information on non-owner occupiers comes from Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. HMDA is implemented by Regulation C (NUM CFR NUM) of the Federal Reserve Board. For more information about HMDA, see Avery, Brevoort, and Canner (DATE). NUM For details about the technique used to identify piggyback loans and for more information about their use, see Avery, Brevoort, and Canner (DATE). BIS Review NUM/DATE effective, such programs must be tightly targeted to borrowers at the highest risk of foreclosure, as measured, for example, by debt-to-income ratio or by the extent to which the mortgage is \"underwater.\" Finding the right balance - particularly the need to avoid programs that give borrowers who can make their payments an incentive to default - is difficult. But realistic public- and private-sector policies must take into account the fact that traditional foreclosure avoidance strategies may not always work well in the current environment. The Federal Reserve's homeownership and mortgage initiatives I would like to say a few words about the Federal Reserve's efforts to strengthen homeownership and reduce preventable foreclosures. The Federal Reserve's decisions regarding monetary policy and our efforts to increase financial stability affect housing and mortgage markets, of course. But, as an organization with a national presence in the form of regional Federal Reserve Banks and their Branches, we are also working to address these issues more directly. We are collaborating with other regulators, community groups, policy organizations, lenders, and public officials to identify ways to prevent unnecessary foreclosures and their negative effects on local economies. Our efforts have taken a variety of forms. First, we have employed economic research and analysis, a particular strength of the Federal Reserve, to increase the sum of knowledge about mortgage and housing issues. For example, we are providing community leaders with detailed analyses identifying neighborhoods at high risk of foreclosures, analogous to the heat maps I showed you TIME.NUM These analyses have helped community organizations better focus their scarce resources, such as deciding where to target counseling services or other intervention efforts. A Federal Reserve System work group has prepared overviews of the current state of knowledge about housing and mortgage markets, and further research is currently under way to fill in the most important analytical gaps. Second, we are collaborating with interested parties across the country, taking advantage of our national presence and our existing relationships with local lenders, community groups, government officials, and other stakeholders, to take practical steps to address the causes and consequences of foreclosures. For example, I mentioned earlier the destabilizing effects foreclosures have on neighborhoods, resulting from factors such as decreased home values and deterioration of vacant properties from neglect. To help address this problem, the Federal Reserve is joining in a partnership with the nonprofit NeighborWorks America to develop materials, tools, and training programs to help communities and others acquire and manage vacant properties. The goal is to support the provision of affordable rental housing and new homeownership opportunities in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal Reserve Banks and Branches have also hosted numerous meetings and workshops to bring together local officials, lenders, community groups, and others to try to find ways to reduce the incidence of foreclosures and mitigate their economic and social effects. Third, we are engaged with mortgage servicers to understand impediments they may face when modifying loans or offering other alternatives to foreclosure. Servicers still report difficulty connecting with troubled borrowers, and we have supported efforts to encourage borrowers to contact their lenders or housing counselors. Working with the Hope Now alliance and independently, we have encouraged the industry to increase their efforts to work with troubled borrowers, to develop guidelines and templates for reasonable standardized approaches to various loss-mitigation techniques, and to adopt uniform reporting standards, such as those sponsored by Hope Now. Clear disclosures of loan modifications will not only make it easier for regulators, the mortgage industry, and homeowners to assess the effectiveness of foreclosure-prevention efforts, but they will also foster greater transparency, and hence greater confidence, in the securitization market. Prospectively, we are committed to promoting an environment that supports the homeownership goals of creditworthy borrowers. To this end, the Federal Reserve Board has proposed new regulations to better protect consumers from a range of unfair or deceptive mortgage lending and advertising practices. To help ensure that the rules are broadly enforced, we are engaging in a program with other federal and state agencies to conduct consumer compliance reviews of nondepository lenders and mortgage brokers. These reviews are targeting underwriting standards, risk-management strategies, and compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve also is continuing its long-standing practice of providing educational and information resources to help consumers make informed personal financial decisions, including choosing the right mortgage. Through their community affairs offices, Federal Reserve Banks are working to establish foreclosure-mitigation resource centers on their websites to be used by small municipalities, housing counselors, and community groups. For consumers who have questions about banking procedures and rules or who believe they may have been treated unfairly by their lender, the Federal Reserve Consumer Help Center directs queries to the various regulatory agencies so that a consumer has only one call to make to ask questions or file complaints.NUM Additional mortgage initiatives Additional government policies can help address problems in the mortgage markets. The Congress can take an important step by moving quickly to reconcile and enact legislation permitting the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to increase its scale and improve its management of risks. Such legislation could help the FHA reach a wider range of borrowers and develop appropriate underwriting and pricing methodologies to deal with any increase in credit risk. Giving the FHA greater latitude to set underwriting standards and risk-based premiums for mortgage refinancing, as well as more flexibility in product development, would allow it to help still more troubled borrowers. Separately, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - could do more. Recently, the Congress expanded Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's role in the mortgage market by temporarily increasing the limits on the sizes of the mortgages they can accept for securitization. In addition, because the GSEs have resolved some of their accounting and operational problems, their federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, has lifted some of the constraints that it had imposed on them. Thus, now is an especially appropriate time for the GSEs to move quickly to raise significant new capital, which they will need to take advantage of these new securitization and investment opportunities, to provide assistance to the housing markets in times of stress, and to do so in a safe and sound manner. As the GSEs expand their role in housing markets, the Congress should move forward on GSE reform legislation, which includes strengthening the regulatory oversight of these companies. As the Federal Reserve has testified on many occasions, it is very important for the health and stability of our housing finance system that the Congress provide the GSE regulator with broad authority to set capital standards, establish a clear and credible receivership process, and define and monitor a transparent public purpose - one that transcends just shareholder interests - for the accumulation of assets held in their portfolios. Conclusion The realtor's mantra is \"location, location, location,\" and, as I have discussed TIME, local variation in housing and mortgage markets is considerable. This variation is useful for understanding the sources of the increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and it should be taken into account as servicers and policymakers consider how best to avoid preventable foreclosures. Most Americans are paying their mortgages on time and are not at risk of foreclosure. But high rates of delinquency and foreclosure can have substantial spillover effects on the housing market, the financial markets, and the broader economy. Therefore, doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interest of lenders and borrowers. It's in everybody's interest. References Avery, Robert B., Kenneth P.

                  "Ben S Bernanke: The Community Reinvestment Act - its evolution and new challenges Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Community Affairs Research Conference, Washington DC, DATE.    This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Enacted in DATE, the CRA affirmed the obligation of federally insured depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of communities in which they are chartered, consistent with safe and sound operations. The act also charged the federal bank regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, with implementing the CRA through regulations and with examining banks and thrifts to determine whether they meet their CRA obligations. The CRA presents an interesting case study of a regulatory regime that has evolved to adjust to changes in the economic, financial, and social environment. Since the CRA's enactment, the implementing regulations have been substantially amended three times--in DATE, and DATE. In each case, changes to the regulations reflected both experience gained in the implementation of the law as well as ongoing developments in financial markets and the economy. In my remarks DATE, I will survey some milestones in the evolution of the CRA, beginning with a description of the economic and social concerns that prompted the passage of the act. With this brief history as background, I will comment on the challenges we face in ensuring that the CRA remains effective and relevant in the future. The origins of the Community Reinvestment Act Public and congressional concerns about the deteriorating condition of America's cities, particularly lower-income and minority neighborhoods, led to the enactment of the Community Reinvestment Act. In the view of many, urban decay was partly a consequence of limited credit availability, which encouraged urban flight and inhibited the rehabilitation of declining neighborhoods. Some critics pinned the blame for the lack of credit availability on mainstream financial institutions, which they characterized as willing to accept deposits from households and small businesses in lower-income neighborhoods but unwilling to lend or invest in those same neighborhoods despite the presence of creditworthy borrowers. Several social and economic factors help explain why credit to lower-income neighborhoods was limited at that time. First, racial discrimination in lending undoubtedly adversely affected local communities. Discriminatory lending practices had deep historical roots. The term \"redlining,\" which refers to the practice of designating certain lower-income or minority neighborhoods as ineligible for credit, appears to have originated in DATE, when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board asked the Home Owners' Loan Corporation to create \"residential security maps\" for NUM cities that would indicate the level of security for real estate investments in each surveyed city.NUM The resulting maps designated four categories of lending and investment risk, each with a letter and color designation. Type \"D\" areas, those considered to be the riskiest for lending and which included many neighborhoods with predominantly African-American populations, were color-coded red on the maps--hence the term \"redlining\" (Federal Home Loan Bank Board, DATE). Private lenders reportedly constructed similar maps that were used to determine credit availability and terms. The DATE Report on Housing by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights reported practices that included requiring high down payments and rapid amortization schedules for African-American borrowers as well as blanket refusals to lend in particular areas. Besides discrimination a variety of economic and institutional factors help to explain the relative unavailability of credit in lower-income neighborhoods.NUM DATE, the secondary market for mortgages was rudimentary at best, which limited local loan originators' access to capital and reduced their ability to diversify credit risks geographically.NUM Informational problems also inhibited lending in some urban areas. For example, relative to higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income areas tend to have fewer home sales and more-diverse housing structures, making accurate appraisal more difficult4. Similarly, credit evaluations tend to be more costly for lower-income borrowers, who are relatively more likely to have short or irregular credit histories.NUM Informational barriers to lending were heightened by the absence of uniform national depositories of information on the credit experiences of consumers; at the time, the credit-reporting system consisted of hundreds of local credit bureaus, each of which maintained limited information on local residents.NUM The high costs of gathering information, together with the difficulty of keeping information proprietary, may have created a \"first-mover\" problem, in which each financial institution has an incentive to let one of its competitors be the first to enter an underserved market. Without some coordination, the first-mover problem may result in no institution choosing to incur the costs of entry (Lang and Nakamura, DATE; Barr, DATE; and Ling, DATE). The regulatory environment of the period was yet another factor limiting broad access to credit. State and federal rules prohibited interstate branching or acquisitions and in some cases restricted even intrastate branching, reducing competition and the ability of lenders to diversify geographic risk.NUM Also, interest rate ceilings on mortgages in some locations effectively blocked lending to potential borrowers judged to pose higher risks, and interest rate ceilings on deposits (notably, the infamous Regulation Q) led to periodic episodes of disintermediation and reduced availability of mortgage credit (Chomsisengphet and Pennington-Cross, DATE; and McNeil and Rechter, DATE). Taken together, these social, economic, and regulatory factors contributed to the perception that banking institutions were failing to adequately serve the credit needs of some residents of their communities, a concern that led the Congress to enact the CRA. The CRA reaffirmed the longstanding principle that financial institutions must serve \"the convenience and needs,\" including credit needs, of the communities in which they are chartered. The obligation of financial institutions to serve their communities was seen as a quid pro quo for privileges such as the protection afforded by federal deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve's discount window (FFIEC, DATE). Indeed, the Bank Holding Company Act, passed in DATE, had already required the Federal Reserve Board, when ruling on proposed acquisitions by banks or bank holding companies, to evaluate how well the institutions involved were meeting community needs, consistent with the requirements of safety and soundness. The CRA was only one of a series of laws passed during DATE intended to reduce credit-related discrimination, expand access to credit, and shed light on lending patterns. The CRA itself focused on the provision of credit to low- and moderate-income communities rather than on discrimination by race, sex, or other personal characteristics. Legislation that addressed discrimination in lending explicitly included the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act was enacted to increase transparency in the mortgage lending market and to support public and NUM Debate continues on the relative importance of racial bias and economic factors for explaining redlining and similar practices (see Lacker, DATE). NUM The Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds accounts did not even record private securitization activity until the early DATEs, and purchases by federal housing agencies, which were focused on government-backed loans and lower-risk conventional loans, represented less than NUM percent of total outstanding home mortgage debt in DATE preceding enactment of the CRA. NUM Analysis of decennial census and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data indicates that lower-income areas have about half the number of owner-occupied homes and home purchase loans in DATE than do higher-income areas. NUM Although information from the period before the CRA is not available, a review of credit records from one of the national credit-reporting agencies DATE supports this conjecture, as it finds that individuals in lower-income areas have, on average, substantially shorter credit histories and only about half as many credit accounts. Also, nearly NUM percent of the individuals in lower-income census tracts cannot be scored, a proportion nearly three times that found in higher-income areas. This information comes from analysis by staff members of the Federal Reserve Board in conjunction with a report to the Congress (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, forthcoming). NUM The low-cost summary measures of credit history that have gained widespread market acceptance DATE did not emerge until DATE, when Fair Isaac and Company developed the FICO score. NUM For a listing of these rules, see Amel and Keane (DATE). BIS Review NUM/DATE private investment activity. From an economic perspective, the CRA can be interpreted as an attempt to rectify market failures--for example, by inducing banks to invest in building the knowledge and expertise necessary to lend profitably in lower-income neighborhoods. Similarly, to the extent that the CRA encouraged coordinated or simultaneous efforts by banks to lend in underserved areas, it had the potential to reduce the first-mover problem. The debate surrounding the passage of the CRA was contentious, with critics charging that the law would distort credit markets, create unnecessary regulatory burden, and lead to unsound lending. Partly in response to these concerns, the Congress included little prescriptive detail in the law. Instead, the CRA simply directs the banking regulatory agencies to ensure that banks serve the credit needs of their local communities in a safe and sound manner. In effect, the agencies were left with considerable discretion and flexibility to modify the rules in light of changes in the economy and in financial markets (Garwood and Smith, DATE). At times, this discretion has been the source of some uncertainty on the part of regulated institutions concerned with compliance. However, the flexibility has proved valuable in allowing the CRA to remain relevant despite rapid economic and financial change and widely differing economic circumstances among neighborhoods. The evolution of the CRA For DATE after its enactment, the CRA was a rather low-profile banking regulation, one that set minimal compliance requirements for depository institutions and attracted limited supervisory attention from the bank regulatory agencies.NUM By the late DATEs, however, the issues surrounding access to credit were attracting renewed interest. In response to this interest, the Congress included in the Financial Institution Reform and Recovery Act of DATE (FIRREA) an amendment to the CRA statute to require public disclosure of institutions' ratings and performance evaluations. FIRREA also expanded data collection and made public certain data reported under the HMDA. With the requisite data becoming available, advocacy groups, researchers, and other analysts began to perform moresophisticated, quantitative analyses of banks' records in meeting the credit needs of their communities. Further attention to CRA was generated by the surge in bank merger and acquisition activities that followed the enactment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of DATE. As public scrutiny of bank merger and acquisition activity escalated, advocacy groups increasingly used the public comment process to protest bank applications on CRA grounds. In instances of highly contested applications, the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies held public meetings to allow the public and the applicants to comment on the lending records of the banks in question. In response to these new pressures, banks began to devote more resources to their CRA programs. Many institutions established separate business units and subsidiary community development corporations to facilitate lending that would be given favorable consideration in CRA examinations. Local and regional public-private partnerships and multibank loan consortia also gained more prominence as banks developed strategies for expanding and managing CRA-related activities. Even as these developments were occurring, extensive change was taking place in the financial services sector. During the DATEs and DATE, technological progress significantly improved data collection and information processing, which led to the development and widespread use of creditscoring models and the availability of generic credit history scores. Deregulation also contributed to the changes in the marketplace. Notably, the lifting of prohibitions against interstate banking was followed by an increased pace of industry consolidation. Also, the preemption of usury laws on home loans created more scope for risk-based pricing of mortgages. Securitization of affordable housing loans expanded, as did the secondary market for those loans, in part reflecting a DATE law that required the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to devote a percentage of their activities to meeting affordable housing goals (HUD, DATE). A generally strong economy and lower interest rates also helped improved access to credit by lower-income households. Bankers were also gaining experience in underwriting and managing the risk of lending in lowerincome communities. After DATE of experimentation, the managers of financial institutions found that these loan portfolios, if properly underwritten and managed, could be profitable. In fact, a Federal Reserve study found that, generally, CRA-related lending activity was at least somewhat profitable and usually did not involve disproportionately higher levels of default (Avery, Bostic, and Canner, DATE; see also Board of Governors, DATE). Moreover, community groups and nonprofit organizations began to take a more businesslike, market-oriented approach to local economic development, leading them to establish more-formalized and more-productive partnerships with banks. Community groups provided information to financial institutions on the needs of lower-income communities for credit and services, offered financial education and counseling services to community members, and referred \"bankable\" customers to partner banks. Specialized community development banks and financial institutions with the mission of providing financial services and credit to lower-income communities and families emerged and grew. Policy developments bolstered the infrastructure and funding of community development lending organizations. Notably, the passage of the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Act of DATE created the CDFI Fund at the Department of Treasury. The expansion of CDFIs provided banks with access to new opportunities to finance community economic development. Other initiatives, such as the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit and New Markets Tax Credit programs provided vehicles for investing in affordable housing development and economic revitalization in distressed communities. Even as CRA-related lending became more extensive and more market-based, concerns were expressed about the implementation of the law. Financial institutions complained about compliance costs (Elliehausen, DATE). Both bankers and community groups criticized the CRA examination procedures as emphasizing process over results, arguing that the examination criteria were too subjective and that a more-quantitative system for evaluating institutions' CRA performance should be developed. In response to these criticisms, President Clinton in DATE directed the agencies that implement CRA to review and revise the regulations, with the goals of clarifying performance standards, making examinations and evaluations more consistent, and reducing the compliance burden. The CRA regulations adopted in DATE established for large institutions a three-pronged test based on performance in the areas of lending, investments, and services. While the regulations placed the greatest emphasis on lending, they encouraged innovative approaches to addressing community development credit needs. Several provisions were included to reduce compliance costs, among them a new rule that allowed small banks to meet their requirements by means of a streamlined examination focused on lending activities.NUM When the new regulations were adopted, the agencies committed themselves to reviewing the regulations in DATE to assess their effectiveness. The promised review made use of extensive public comment and scholarly research on the efficacy of CRA programs. In their comments on the proposed revisions to the rules, bankers and community organizations generally agreed that the fundamental elements of the regulations were sound and that the agencies should maintain the overall structure of the DATE regulations, although each group raised a number of specific issues. Findings from the research by Board staff members, in combination with the public comments, led the agencies to propose new definitions for \"small\" banks, which would be subject only to a lending test to assess compliance with the CRA, and for \"intermediate small\" banks, which would be subject to a lending test as well as a new and more-flexible community development test (Avery, Canner, Mok, and Sokolov, DATE). In addition, the research underscored the benefit of expanding the definition of \"community development\" to include activities benefiting middle-income communities in distressed rural areas and in disaster areas. The final rule was adopted in DATE DATE. In each of the major regulatory revisions, the goal of the regulators has been to increase the effectiveness of the CRA in promoting the economic development of lower-income communities while reducing the associated compliance burden. Again, making progress toward achieving these goals has been made easier by the flexibility of the original statute, which has allowed the regulators to adapt the rules to changing market and economic circumstances and to give financial institutions the latitude to meet their CRA obligations in diverse and cost-effective ways. Has the CRA achieved its objectives? Research on the CRA has tended to find positive net effects, but the results are not uniform. A paper by Board staff members compared census tracts just above and below the low- and moderate-income threshold, finding that the tracts below the threshold had higher homeownership rates, higher growth in owner-occupied units, and lower vacancy rates than would have otherwise been predicted (Avery, Calem, and Canner, DATE). An analysis by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies concluded that the CRA has expanded access to residential mortgages for lower-income borrowers, but that research also finds that the CRA's effect is diminishing as mortgage lending by nonbank institutions expands (Apgar and Duda, DATE). Yet another review concludes that the CRA has been effective in helping to overcome market failures and reduce discrimination at a relatively low cost, precisely because the CRA sets forth a flexible standard rather than a rule (Barr, DATE). However, some critical studies have argued that the CRA has been ineffective in addressing discrimination and market failures and that its social costs outweigh its benefits (see, for example, Hylton, DATE, and Barr, DATE). The CRA is clearly far from perfect. Although its objectives are broad and ambitious, its net effects on lower-income neighborhoods are difficult to measure with precision.NUM Addressing CRA responsibilities also imposes costs on financial institutions. It appears that, at least in some instances, the CRA has served as a catalyst, inducing banks to enter underserved markets that they might otherwise have ignored. At its most successful, the CRA may have had a multiplier effect, supplementing its direct impact by stimulating new market-based, profit-driven economic activity in lower-income neighborhoods. The future of the CRA As we look forward, the CRA will have to continue evolving to reflect the ongoing changes in financial markets and in the economy more generally. I will conclude by flagging just a few of the issues that will remain important for the implementation and the effect of CRA. First, for some institutions the concept of the \"local community\" is no longer as clear as it was when the CRA was enacted. DATE, some institutions are not identified with a particular community but are regional or national in scope, which inevitably makes the definition of the relevant assessment areas somewhat difficult. Moreover, to an increasing extent, banks use nontraditional avenues--the Internet, for example--to interact with customers, in some cases avoiding a bricks-and-mortar presence altogether. To date, defining \"local community\" for the purposes of CRA assessment has been manageable as most banks still lend in local communities where they have deposit-taking facilities or branches. However, if these trends continue, defining a \"local community\" may become increasingly difficult, and the concept eventually may require reconsideration by regulators or even the Congress. Second, changes in the structure of the financial industry have resulted in many financial transactions that fell under the CRA umbrella in DATE having become increasingly the province of nondepositories not subject to CRA, including companies owned by banks or bank holding companies. Holding companies' nonbank affiliates, for instance, can be included in the CRA assessment of the banking institution at the discretion of the bank but need not be. Most mortgages are now packaged by brokers, and nearly two in three mortgages are originated by nondepositories not covered by the CRA.NUM Nonbank institutions, such as DATE lenders, check cashers, and remittance agents, are important sources of financial services in low- and moderate-income communities. In some cases, nonbank service providers offer convenience to customers but at prices that have raised concerns (Carr and Schuetz, DATE, and Barr, DATE). Some observers have suggested extending the CRA to nonbank providers, but this proposal neglects a fundamental premise of the CRA legislation--that banks incur special obligations in exchange for the advantages conferred by their charters, such as deposit insurance. Of course, the CRA is not the only tool for addressing such issues, should it be determined that consumers are not adequately protected in their dealings with nonbanks. The CRA may nevertheless have some role to play; for example, a possible question to consider is whether increasing the focus on services by banking institutions might encourage them to compete more actively with nonbank providers in lower-income neighborhoods. Third, access to credit in lower-income communities is obviously much greater DATE than when the CRA was enacted. This greater access has had tangible benefits, such as the increase in homeownership rates (Joint Center for Housing Studies, DATE). However, recent problems in mortgage markets illustrate that an underlying assumption of the CRA--that more lending equals better outcomes for local communities may not always hold.NUM Whether, and if so, how to try to differentiate \"good\" from \"bad\" lending in the CRA context is an issue that is likely to challenge us for some time. One possible strategy is to place more weight in CRA examinations on factors such as whether an institution provides services complementary to lending--for example, counseling and financial education. The CRA was created to help ensure lower-income communities have access to credit and financial services. When it passed the legislation, the Congress could not have foreseen the extensive changes in financial markets and the economy that have occurred over the past thirty DATE; thus, the decision to write the statute broadly and with considerable flexibility appears wise in retrospect. In implementing the law, the banking agencies have tried to learn from market developments, from research, and from the comments of financial institutions, consumers, and other interested parties. The regulations have thus changed over time in response to the changing financial landscape and as we have learned more about what works and what doesn't. We do not know how the economy and the financial system will change in DATE, but it is safe to assume that change will be rapid. Considerable creativity and flexibility will thus be necessary to ensure that the CRA continues to assist community economic development without placing an undue burden on financial institutions.

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Improving the infrastructure for non-agency mortgage-backed securities Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve System Conference on Housing and Mortgage Markets, Washington DC, DATE. The original speech, which contains a link to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    I very much appreciate the opportunity to participate in this conference and to hear your insights firsthand about such a range of important topics. As you know, housing markets are weak. Sales of new homes and of existing homes are well below their respective peaks around DATE. House prices have fallen sharply - the national price index published by the Federal Housing Finance Agency is down almost NUM percent from its high in DATE, and the Case-Shiller national index is down more than NUM percent from its peak about NUM-NUM/NUM years ago. Residential construction has remained weak, with single-family housing starts having declined to less than a third the number seen early in DATE. Even with the drop in homebuilding, the inventory of unsold new homes represents DATE supply at the recent pace of sales. Taken together, these data suggest continuing near-term challenges for stabilization of the housing market. With the plunge in home sales and house prices as well as very tight lending conditions, mortgage borrowing by households has fallen sharply over DATE. Indeed, the latest information suggests that, on net, home mortgage debt may not have increased at all since DATE. Moreover, most of the new mortgages that were originated in DATE were funded with mortgage-backed securities (MBS) guaranteed by the government housing agencies - Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. That is, origination of mortgages not eligible for a government guarantee has fallen dramatically as issuance of private-label MBS has virtually come to a halt DATE. The rapid deterioration in credit quality of mortgages in subprime and so-called alt-A MBS pools - and the subsequent severe rating downgrades of the securities they backed - has significantly eroded the value of and investor confidence in private-label MBS. In my remarks DATE, I would like to suggest some fundamental changes in the structure of private-label MBS that might help a recovery, over time, in investor confidence and in the market for these securities. I believe that mortgage securitization has the potential to deliver economic value to investors, lenders, and, ultimately, borrowers.NUM Several conditions would be necessary for the potential of private-label MBS to be realized going forward. A necessary condition is for comprehensive and standardized loan-level data covering the entire pool of loans backing MBS to be made available and easily accessible so that the underlying credit quality can be rigorously analyzed by market participants more easily than is now the case. But comprehensive data will not be sufficient. In addition, a number of aspects of the securities themselves will probably need to be changed. First, the structures of cash flows from mortgage payments in the pool to the various tranches of MBS should be much less complex than some of those created in DATE. Second, securitization contracts will need to be made more homogeneous so as to allow greater comparability of risk profiles across deals and perhaps promote more robust liquidity. Third, securitizations should involve fewer and larger tranches of MBS, which, in addition to further promoting liquidity, could also reduce the exposure of some securities to certain tail risks and model uncertainty. I believe that a new infrastructure built upon these foundations might reasonably be expected to lower the costs of information production and processing in the marketplace. The reduction of these costs will facilitate broader independent credit analyses, greater due diligence by potential purchasers, and, hence, greater ability to provide a double check on credit rating agencies' evaluation of the riskiness of the securities. In other words, market participants would be more likely to acquire the expertise to evaluate securities issues that were more homogeneous and less complex. This change would make the situation closer to what occurs in the corporate bond market, in which standardized disclosures about relatively homogeneous and straightforward securities of publicly traded companies allow many analysts and potential purchasers to come up with their own evaluations, in addition to those of the credit rating agencies. Moreover, such changes might also lead to the creation of structures whose credit analyses are less sensitive to certain tail risks and types of model uncertainty and more likely to be liquid even in times of market stress. Thus, this new infrastructure might allow investors gradually to regain confidence in their ability to assess the risk-return tradeoffs inherent in MBS, allowing them to reconsider how those securities may best fit into their overall portfolios. As I mentioned, in principle, mortgage securitizations make good economic sense: By providing access to the broad capital market, securitization allows loan originators to access a wider source of funding than they can obtain directly. In addition, securitization can limit an originator's exposure to prepayment risks associated with interest rate movements, to geographic concentrations of loans, and to credit and funding risks associated with holding mortgages all the way to maturity. Effectively, securitization can significantly lower the cost of extending home loans, and some of those cost savings can be passed along to homeowners in the form of lower mortgage rates. It seems clear that the housing government-sponsored enterprises (or agencies) played an important role in the development of mortgage securitization in the United States. In large part, the broad appeal of agency MBS can be traced to the explicit guarantee of the securities by the sponsoring agencies. This agency support may have meant that the returns to undertaking a thorough and costly credit analysis of underlying mortgages in agency MBS pools were low, so that task was essentially left to the agencies themselves. Indeed, even as agency MBS issuance took off in DATE and DATE, the most basic infrastructure needed to conduct credit analysis on home mortgage pools - comprehensive loan-level data that was broadly accessible in a standardized format - went essentially undeveloped. The paucity and inaccessibility of data about the underlying home loans was, in my opinion, one of the reasons that private-label MBS was able to expand so rapidly in DATE and DATE despite a deterioration in underwriting and prospective credit performance. That is not to say that better data would necessarily have led investors to completely sidestep the private-label MBS that have caused them so much difficulty. But I do think it was a significant hindrance that the information needed to infer, in real time, the extent to which subprime and alt-A mortgage underwriting was sliding simply did not exist in a form that allowed the widespread scrutiny or objective analyses needed to bring these risks more clearly into focus. Thus, I believe that markets for private-label MBS are unlikely to recover unless comprehensive and standardized data for home mortgage pools are made widely available to market participants. As you may be aware, the American Securitization Forum (ASF) is in the midst of a large-scale project called RESTART, or Residential Securitization Transparency and Reporting. This project seeks to develop a standardized format for mortgage data that would be available to all investors and other market participants, with the goal of substantially improving disclosure and transparency related to private-label MBS. RESTART has wide support in the industry, and the project is receiving input from a wide range of market participants, including investors, mortgage originators, loan servicers, credit bureaus, credit rating agencies, MBS trustees, legal counselors, and data vendors. Indeed, just DATE, a report issued by a consortium of several securitization industry groups endorsed the RESTART project in its first recommendation for an \"action plan\" to work to restore confidence in securitization markets.NUM Although, to be sure, some time will be required to develop specific recommendations and then to overcome implementation issues, I am encouraged by the ambition of the project and the vigor with which participants appear to be working on it. While comprehensive loan-level data for mortgage pools are necessary to rebuild confidence in private-label MBS, I now wish to elaborate a bit on improvements in the contractual structure of private-label MBS that are, in my view, also needed to revive the market. First, in DATE, the complexity of many deals made non-agency MBS difficult to value. For example, looking at private-label MBS deals constructed in the heyday of DATE, some subprime trusts included three separate pools of mortgages - for example, prime-rated jumbo loans, alt-A first liens, and a blend of subprime first and junior liens - with cash flows that were prioritized using complicated payoff rules among more than a dozen different securities. The securitization contract might have dictated that one AAA-rated tranche might have been paid using only cash flows from the prime jumbo loans, while another AAA-rated tranche could have received no payments at all from that pool. Second, non-agency mortgage securitization contracts contained numerous idiosyncratic features that limited the comparability of deals that may have appeared to be similarly structured. Not only might there have been subtle but significant differences in the cash flow obligations to each tranche, but there was also much variation in other important provisions, such as duties on servicers of the loans in the pool and the representations and warranties that govern the circumstances under which poorly performing loans can be put back to the originator. Thus, even if comprehensive data on the loans in the pools had been available, a thorough credit analysis would have required both a detailed reading of the deal-specific documentation describing a particular deal's potentially unique structure and a careful analysis of how its cash flow prioritization would affect returns to holders of the particular tranches of securities as laid out in the contract. Although such an analysis is possible, it may be beyond the available resources for many investors. I believe that more homogeneous mortgage securitization contracts could significantly lower the barriers to entry for credit analysts, thereby promoting greater transparency and perhaps more confidence among investors about the securities' underlying risk-return attributes. Third, larger tranches in private-label MBS could have a couple of key benefits. For instance, investors might view larger security issues as being more likely to sustain liquid trading conditions, which would allow investors to rebalance their portfolios, as conditions evolve, at reasonably predictable prices and with transaction costs comparable to those of other securities traded in \"thick\" markets. In addition, as has become evident, tranched securitizations are exposed to tail risks - situations that can be expected to occur only rarely but which convey very negative returns. My intuition is that thinner tranches are more vulnerable to tail risks, because it seems more likely in the latter case that widespread credit losses in the underlying loan pool could wipe out designated cash flows for the entire tranche - so-called nonlinear, or cliff, effects. Thus, future mortgage securitizations that rely on simpler cash flows and larger tranches might reduce some of the exposure to tail risks and enable investors to gain confidence. As an aside, I should note that I do not expect a revival for some of the most complex structures that were created in DATE to finance a portion of subprime and alt-A mortgages. I am thinking specifically of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that were themselves backed by other structured credit products, including the lower-rated tranches of private-label MBS. These so-called two-layer securitizations were far more complex and much more exposed to systematic losses than were the MBS themselves. Indeed, investors in - and more importantly, financial institutions that retained - the super senior tranches of CDO-squared securities took substantial losses as the severity of the downturn in the housing market and in mortgage credit quality became evident. Given the magnitude of those losses and the recognition that rigorous credit analyses are extremely information-intensive (and very sensitive to assumptions about loss correlations), I would expect investors to remain skeptical of two-layer securitized financial products for the foreseeable future. To the extent that larger tranches of simpler and more homogeneous securities might encourage broader information processing and credit analyses, they could play a role in rebuilding investor confidence. Corporations that issue large amounts of bonds, for example, tend to be followed by quite a number of analysts. Consequently, investors can access a wide range of information and opinions about those companies, providing a check - and less overall reliance - on credit analyses produced by the credit rating agencies themselves. In sum, an improved infrastructure for non-agency MBS should include comprehensive, loanby-loan data that are available in a standardized format that is readily accessible, but a robust data platform will not be sufficient. A new infrastructure will probably also include lesscomplex cash flow waterfalls, more homogeneous contract designs, and larger tranches of securities. With these features, the new infrastructure could increase transparency, and promote independent, objective credit analysis for the various classes of non-agency MBS. By facilitating detailed information processing and independent risk analyses, the reliance on credit rating agencies could be reduced, easing the way for investors to regain confidence in these securities and for liquidity to return in these valuable markets. That said, the recovery in the market for non-agency MBS - and, more broadly, for the origination of home mortgages that depend on these securities for funding - is bound to be a gradual process. It will take time to develop and implement a new infrastructure such as the one I have outlined, and for investor confidence to be rebuilt. In addition, investors could remain wary of re-engaging in the market for private-label MBS until they become convinced that housing markets around the country are on the mend.",

                  "Randall S Kroszner: Protecting homeowners and sustaining homeownership Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals Legislative Conference NUM, Washington DC, DATE.    The mortgage market has long been a source of strength in the U.S. economy, but it is facing significant challenges, especially in the subprime segment that serves consumers who have shorter or weaker credit records. As of DATE, DATE for which data are available, about NUM percent of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were DATE delinquent, twice the level DATE earlier.NUM Roughly NUM,NUM foreclosures were started on these mortgages in DATE, up NUM percent from the previous quarter.NUM The significance of the problems with subprime loan performance is evident in the unusually high rate of defaults within DATE of loan origination, known as early payment defaults. In DATE, nearly NUM percent of subprime ARMs originated in DATE were already DATE delinquent, twice the rate of DATE and nearly four times the rate DATE earlier.NUM These problems have many causes, but the role of abusive lending practices is of particular concern. Such practices have led many people into homeownership that they cannot sustain, and have had adverse effects on their neighbors and communities as defaults and foreclosures can lead to declines in the values of surrounding properties. Practices that have hurt consumers have also undermined the confidence of investors and contributed to a virtual shutdown of the subprime market with consequences for other segments of the mortgage market. As a result, it is difficult for many borrowers, especially in the subprime space, to obtain home loans. The implications of diminished access to mortgage credit are of particular concern to the audience DATE, given that the subprime market was the source of home purchase loans extended to many in the Hispanic community. These events have highlighted the shared interest of mortgage borrowers, their communities, lenders, and investors in protecting borrowers from abusive practices and preserving their choices. Abusive loans that strip their equity or cause them to lose their homes must not be tolerated. Protecting borrowers with responsible underwriting standards also protects the integrity and proper functioning of the mortgage market by increasing investor confidence Effective consumer protection produces a complementary benefit for consumers by making more capital available to meet their needs. Similarly, systematic efforts to keep borrowers who may have trouble meeting their loan obligations in their homes on a sustainable basis, by providing more certainty to the market, can have the complementary benefit of ensuring the flow of capital for potential borrowers. With these principles in mind, I will discuss current initiatives to mitigate foreclosures. Then I will spend most of my time discussing the Board's recent initiative in proposing new regulations that apply to all mortgage lenders, not just federally supervised banks, that are designed to prevent abuse, unfairness, and deception in residential mortgage lending. The expansive scope of this proposal is essential to ensure that consumer protections convey across the mortgage market, regardless of whether a borrower receives a loan from a bank, an independent mortgage company, or through a mortgage broker. Preventing unnecessary foreclosures Given the high cost of foreclosures to lenders and investors and the disruption and distress that foreclosure can cause to consumers, their families, and their communities, it is in everyone's interest to avoid foreclosures whenever other viable options exist. With large numbers of borrowers facing potential repayment problems, it is in the interest of borrowers and investors alike for the industry to develop prudent loan modification programs and other assistance to help borrowers on a systematic and sustainable basis. As you know, there are various initiatives underway to help borrowers struggling with their mortgages. NeighborWorks America and the Homeownership Preservation Foundation offer financial counseling services through the Homeowners HOPE hotline. The Hope Now Alliance, a broad-based coalition of government sponsored enterprises, industry trade associations, counseling agencies, and mortgage servicers, is making efforts to find ways to help borrowers through loan modification plans. The Federal Housing Administration has established the FHASecure plan to provide qualified borrowers who are delinquent because of an interest rate reset and who have some equity in the home the opportunity to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage. I have been an active proponent of such streamlined systematic approaches to reduce transactions costs and to help mitigate foreclosure risk, and I strongly encourage market participants to adopt and to implement these fast-track modification proposals as quickly as possible. I applaud these efforts but also recognize that much more must be done. Challenges remain, for example, with respect to ongoing constraints on servicing capacity to expedite work outs. Servicers must undertake the investment to overcome the capacity challenges and provide transparent and timely measures of the results. The Federal Reserve has been working with financial institutions and community groups around the country to address the challenges posed by problem loans. For instance, we have been providing community coalitions, counseling agencies, fellow regulators, and others with detailed analyses identifying neighborhoods at high risk of foreclosures. By understanding those areas with concentrations of subprime mortgages, delinquencies, and foreclosures, community leaders can better target their scarce resources to borrowers in need of counseling and other interventions that may help forestall foreclosure. Communities are also working to find ways to address the challenges that foreclosed homes can present, such as decreased home values and vacant properties that can deteriorate from neglect. Toward this end, the Federal Reserve has recently engaged in a partnership with NeighborWorks America to help identify strategies to help stabilize neighborhoods. It is essential that organizations with access to at-risk homeowners, particularly those who may have additional challenges, such as language barriers, engage in foreclosure prevention initiatives to help keep families in their homes and stabilize communities. The Federal Reserve has worked to support consumers by providing them with the information they need to understand and shop for banking products, as well as to file a complaint against a bank. Many of these consumer education brochures are available in Spanish. Importantly, we have just launched a Spanish-language version of the Federal Reserve Consumer Help Center to help better meet the needs of Spanish-speaking consumers. We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of consumers contacting us since we launched this centralized call center and website in DATE, and now we have the capability to reach even greater numbers by providing information and assistance to Spanish-speaking consumers at NUM-NUM-NUM The Board's proposal I will now focus on the Board's recent proposal for stricter regulations prohibiting abusive and deceptive practices in the mortgage market under authority of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). This proposal is intended to protect consumers and to preserve consumer choice by targeting protections to borrowers who face the most risk. We have also sought to ensure that these standards are clear for lenders to reduce unintended consequences for consumers. Though clear, the standards are intended to be not overly prescriptive, so as to preserve access to responsible credit while amply protecting consumers. Our proposal is also comprehensive, covering most mortgage loans with certain protections and the entire subprime market with certain more specific regulations. While comprehensive, the proposal would focus protections where the risks are greatest and preserve consumers' access to responsible credit. Our effort to produce robust, clear, and comprehensive rules was based on a rigorous analysis of available qualitative and quantitative data. We have put this proposal out for public comment until DATE and eagerly seek suggestions to be able to craft the best possible final rule. Comprehensive scope Let me say more about the comprehensive scope of this proposal. It would apply stricter regulations to higher-priced mortgage loans, which we have defined broadly, and it covers all types of mortgage lenders, unlike guidance that only applies to federally insured banks. We were particularly interested in ensuring that protections remain strong over time as loan products and lending practices change. Our analysis of the data suggested that the troubles in the mortgage market generally arise not from a single practice in isolation, but instead from the complex ways that risk factors and underwriting practices can affect each other, sometimes called \"risk layering.\" Therefore, we have proposed using a loan's DATE percentage rate, or APR, to determine whether the loan is covered by stricter regulations.NUM Because the APR is closely correlated to risk, the proposed protections would cover loans with higher risks rather than single out particular risk factors or underwriting practices. With the APR thresholds we have proposed, we expect that the new protections would cover the entire subprime mortgage market and the riskier end of the \"near prime\" market, the latter also known as the \"alt-A\" market. Covering part of the alt-A market would anticipate possible actions by lenders to avoid restrictions on subprime loans priced near the threshold. It would also address real risks to consumers in the alt-A segment. This segment grew very rapidly, and it layered risks, such as undocumented income, on top of other risks, such as nontraditional loan structures allowing borrowers to defer paying principal and interest. However, we have heard from commenters who have expressed concern that in the current market environment, the proposed trigger could cover the market too broadly, and we will carefully consider the issues they raise and other possible approaches to achieve our objective. Our public hearings and our analysis identified problems not just in higher-priced loans, but also in the broader mortgage market. Thus, our proposal addresses unfair or deceptive practices for the vast majority of mortgage loans secured by a consumer's primary home. Areas targeted this broadly include broker steering, appraisal coercion, unwarranted servicing fees, and deceptive advertising. I'll touch on broker steering toward the end of my remarks. Robust approach to affordability Extending credit that borrowers can afford to repay is a fundamental pillar of responsible lending. Across the whole range of higher-priced mortgage loans, our proposal offers three rules that, working in combination, would help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. First, is a requirement that a lender maintain responsible underwriting practices that genuinely assess borrowers' ability to repay. This general requirement would be complemented by a specific requirement to verify the income and assets of the borrower that are relied upon in making the loan. A third rule would require lenders to escrow property taxes and homeowners insurance to help borrowers meet these obligations. This robust approach to affordability would help ensure that the subprime market promotes sustainable homeownership. Just as important, it would also help protect consumers from abusive refinancings that strip equity. Clear lending standards have the further advantages of increasing investor confidence in the mortgage market and helping to revive the flow of credit to consumers with shorter or weaker credit records. Assessment of repayment ability Now I want to discuss the major elements of our proposed regulations for higher-priced loans in a little more depth, starting with the requirement to assess repayment ability. The regulations would prohibit a lender from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higherpriced loans based on the value of the borrower's house rather than on the borrower's ability to repay from income, or from assets other than the house. This prohibition is intentionally broad to capture all risks to loan performance and the different ways that these risks can be layered. Moreover, the proposal avoids prescribing quantitative underwriting requirements. For example, the proposal would prohibit a pattern or practice of disregarding the ratio of applicants' income to their debt, but it does not prescribe a maximum ratio because the appropriate number depends heavily on other risk factors, which vary from loan to loan. At the same time, the proposal does offer specifics. For example, it would create a presumption that a lender had violated the regulations if it engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to underwrite at the fully-indexed rate.NUM Our proposed regulations would be more robust and comprehensive than the subprime guidance the agencies issued DATE. The regulations would apply to all mortgage lenders, including independent mortgage companies. Moreover, the regulations would be legally enforceable by supervisory and enforcement agencies. Just as important, the regulations, unlike the guidance, would be legally enforceable by consumers who could recover statutory and actual damages for violations. The proposed requirement to assess repayment ability is intended to protect consumers from abusive practices while maintaining their access to responsible credit. We recognize that satisfying both objectives at the same time is a challenge. The proposed rule's potential for consumer actions, coupled with its careful avoidance of prescribing quantitative underwriting thresholds, could raise compliance and litigation risk. In turn, this could raise the cost of credit for higher-risk borrowers or limit the availability of responsible credit. That is why we have proposed prohibiting a \"pattern or practice\" of disregarding repayment ability rather than attaching a risk of legal liability to every individual loan that does not perform. Some commentators have argued that the pattern or practice requirement creates a higher standard of proof that can make it more difficult and costly for consumers to pursue litigation. We have specifically sought comment on this provision and look forward to perspectives offered by the industry and consumer groups. Income verification When we looked closely at why so many borrowers had mortgages that they struggled to repay so soon after taking out the loan, the prevalence of \"stated-income\" lending was a clear culprit. Substantial anecdotal evidence indicates that failing to verify income invited fraud. Moreover, when we looked at the loan-level data we saw a clear correlation between \"low-doc\" or \"no-doc\" lending and performance problems, particularly early payment defaults. That is why we have proposed to complement a broad requirement to assess repayment ability with a specific requirement to verify the income or assets a lender relies on to make a credit decision. We recognize that stated-income lending may have a proper place when not layered on top of too many other risks. Therefore, we would target the verification requirement to higher-priced loans, including the higher-priced end of the alt-A market, where the risks of stated-income lending could be layered on top of too many other risks. The proposal identifies standard documents that would be acceptable, such as W-NUM forms. It also allows, however, any third party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of income. Some consumers may have access to only nonstandard documents and others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs, may have some difficulty documenting their income. This rule is meant to preserve consumer choice by allowing the market to identify credible nontraditional documentation of consumer income - for example, check-cashing receipts. To help ensure that the proposal preserves access to credit for the full range of consumers, we have sought public comment on this issue. Escrows for taxes and insurance Another part of our proposal for higher-priced loans - a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance - would also help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. Escrowing has become standard practice in the prime market, and the case for making it standard in the subprime market, too, appears compelling. Consumers with shorter or weaker credit histories may be less likely to appreciate the sizable burden that taxes and insurance can add to the cost of homeownership, or more vulnerable to being misled by payment quotes that leave out these amounts. Moreover, when we looked at the data, we saw in the unusually high level of early payment defaults possible evidence that the lack of escrows hurt consumers who did not have experience paying property tax and insurance bills. We have proposed to address the problem with a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance on higher-priced loans, accompanied by a limited allowance for opt-out. We wanted the regulations to prevent irresponsible efforts to encourage borrowers to opt out. So the rule would not permit opt-out at the closing table, but instead would require that DATE pass before a consumer may opt out. The DATE waiting period would also apply if a consumer refinanced into another high-cost loan, reducing the likelihood that consumers would refinance solely to decrease DATE payments by eliminating escrowing of taxes and insurance. In this respect the proposal is intended to preserve consumer choice while protecting consumers from unaffordable mortgage obligations. Prepayment penalties Having discussed the rules that would promote affordability, I want to say a word about our proposed rule on prepayment penalties. These penalties can take a toll on consumers who have riskier loans, and many consumers may not even be aware their loans have a penalty. Accordingly, we have proposed a ban on prepayment penalties in circumstances of a high degree of risk to the consumer, and we are also addressing transparency concerns. The proposed rule would ban prepayment penalties where they are most likely to prevent a consumer from refinancing a loan that has a particularly burdensome payment. Specifically, a penalty would be prohibited where the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds NUM percent, and a penalty would have to expire before a loan's payment could increase. The rule would also ban prepayment penalties where they are more likely to be part of a \"loan flipping\" scheme - specifically, where a lender or its affiliate refinances the lender's own loan. Banning penalties altogether could cause all borrowers, including those who do not prepay, to bear the full cost of investors' prepayment risk, which could raise questions of fairness, and it could reduce consumer choice. We recognize there are differing views on this and look forward to gaining those perspectives through the comment process. Steering I have so far discussed the elements of our proposal that would seek to ensure that underwriting practices and loan terms on higher-priced loans do not present unwarranted risks to consumers. There is another potential source of risk to consumers that I want to address that is related to \"steering\" - the risk that when they use the services of a mortgage broker, they do not appreciate the extent to which the broker's interests may diverge from the consumer's interests because of \"yield spread premiums.\"NUM The growth of the market for brokerage services has no doubt increased competition in the market for mortgage loans, to the benefit of consumers. Moreover, the yield spread premium, a payment from a lender to a broker based on the loan's interest rate, is sometimes the best way for a consumer to fund the cost of a broker's services. However, when a lender pays a broker for a loan that has a higher rate, that payment can create a conflict of interest between the broker and the consumer. This conflict is problematic if the consumer does not know it exists or assumes, incorrectly, that the broker is obligated to put the consumer's interests first. In such cases, the consumer cannot protect his or her own interests, and competition for loans and for brokerage services does not work effectively. Therefore, we have proposed to prohibit a lender, for both prime and subprime loans, from paying a broker any more than the consumer had expressly agreed that the broker would receive. This agreement must be executed up-front, before the consumer has submitted an application and become invested in closing the deal. The combination of stricter regulation and better disclosure that we are proposing should help reduce a broker's incentive to steer a consumer to a higher rate, empower consumers to shop and negotiate among brokers, and preserve consumers' option to use the services of a broker. Better and earlier information for consumers Lastly, to protect consumers and promote competition, our proposed regulation would prohibit misleading mortgage advertising and require that consumers receive loan-specific disclosures early in the application process, when they can use the information to shop more effectively. We recognize, however, that we face a challenge in ensuring that disclosures for mortgage loans remain effective. We have begun a comprehensive program of rigorous consumer testing of potential improvements to current disclosures. Conclusion There are more elements of our comprehensive proposal that I do not have time DATE to discuss, such as a prohibition against coercing appraisers and restrictions on unwarranted servicing fees. We anticipate vigorous public comment on this proposal, and once we have carefully considered all the input we receive, we will move expeditiously to a final rule. As I noted at the outset, effective consumer protection can help to restore confidence in the mortgage markets and help to preserve the flow of capital to consumers who wish to purchase a home. It is not too early to emphasize that the effectiveness of the final rule will depend critically on effective enforcement. The Federal Reserve will do its part to ensure compliance among the institutions it supervises. We also have been instrumental in launching a pilot project with other federal and state agencies to conduct consumer compliance reviews of non-depository lenders and other industry participants. I am sure we will be aided in these efforts by a new system for registering and tracking mortgage brokers recently launched by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. While we work to build effective consumer protections and enforcement regimes for future consumers, we will also continue our efforts, and encourage the initiatives many others are undertaking, to limit unnecessary foreclosures for consumers who are hurting now.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: Envisioning a future for housing finance Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Mortgage Foreclosure Policy Conference, Chicago, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    Good TIME. I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for this opportunity to offer my perspectives on the housing market - a topic of paramount importance to us all. The conference theme suggests that I take you on a retrospective journey about homeownership in the past, bring you into DATE with thoughts about the current challenging conditions, and leave you with insights on the future state of mortgage finance and housing policies. With DATE upon us, I must admit that I find this trip reminiscent of A Christmas Ebenezer Scrooge's journey in Carol. The Ghost of Homeownership Past might, in retrospect, remind us of a seemingly idyllic time in our nation's history, with high and rising homeownership rates, while the Ghost of Homeownership Present would likely describe one of the bleaker periods in our nation's economy. But I hope that the Ghost of Homeownership Yet to Come would be much cheerier than Dickens' spectral visitor and would show us a future with a housing and mortgage finance system that functions efficiently and provides adequate safeguards for consumers, lenders, and investors going forward. I'm afraid I cannot describe for you, as assuredly as Dickens might, just what that future market will look like, but I will share my thoughts on some general principles that, I would argue, we should look for in new market structures or practices that may emerge. Responsible home ownership and housing finance responsible Let me establish from the outset that I believe homeownership has, for DATE, proven to be good business and good public policy. The benefits derived from sustainable homeownership - including robust local investment and household financial stability - bring value to a community. Homeownership has been the principal means for many families to build wealth and financial stability over time, to use this wealth as a further investment in education and entrepreneurship, and to transfer this wealth to future generations. Lenders who engage in safe, sensible underwriting help to ensure that borrowers are matched with loan products that they can repay. In turn, borrowers can use debt to buy a productive asset that they could not otherwise purchase. Although leverage gained a bad name in the recent crisis, responsible and sustainable leverage can normally help more individuals become homeowners sooner. The scarcity of available mortgage lending at present - especially the lack of relatively lowdown-payment products beyond the Veterans Administration (VA) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) market - most hurts modest-income households who lack other assets. This makes it especially difficult for first-time and minority homebuyers to enter the market. Going forward, the challenge will be to encourage responsible, well-underwritten loan products for these segments of the market while banning lending activity that is unfair or deceptive. Homeownership Past Depending on how far back you walk with the Ghost of Homeownership Past, you might reach a seemingly idyllic world where all mortgages were simple contracts made by local institutions lending for their own portfolios to consumers who could make a substantial down payment and had excellent credit. But in that ostensibly happy place, many responsible consumers were excluded from the benefits of homeownership, funds for lending were limited, and lending institutions ultimately found themselves with unmanageable interest rate risk. In DATE and the earlier part of DATE, financial engineering in the secondary market for mortgages led to the development of more flexible products, efficient underwriting systems, and alternatives for new borrowers to enter the market - all good outcomes when done right. Experimentation, technological advances, and data modeling allowed for the development of niche mortgage products that could better meet the needs of particular subgroups of potential borrowers. These tools, when coupled with other risk mitigants, allowed greater numbers of Americans to buy, and stay in, homes they could afford. But not all of this innovation proved to be positive, for either borrowers or investors. The market overheated. Mortgages became increasingly complex and opaque, as did the mortgage-backed securities that were then offered to investors. Risk innovation became risk layering. A speculative mentality took hold among investors and consumers who expected limitless house price appreciation. Borrowers overreached; risk mitigation peeled away as niche products were mass marketed; lenders made and purchased mortgage loans with lax underwriting standards; and investors relied too heavily on what turned out to be faulty ratings of poorly structured securities. All of this contributed to a housing price bubble that, as we are all too aware, eventually burst. In response, the surviving lenders severely curtailed credit availability. Homeownership Present The lingering effects of this recent history continue to be felt in DATE's housing market. We are now seeing high delinquency rates in every category of mortgages. While defaults in DATE and DATE were elevated by poor underwriting practices and the use of inappropriate mortgage products, the current deterioration reflects to a greater degree job losses and lower house prices. In addition, reduced home equity has impaired borrowers' abilities to refinance their mortgages or sell their homes to cope with income loss, unexpected expenses, or adverse life events. Numerous public, private, and nonprofit efforts are underway to keep these delinquencies from becoming a wave of foreclosures. For example, the Federal Reserve's program of purchasing government agency mortgage-backed securities has significantly reduced mortgage rates, which, in combination with the Administration's Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), has enabled millions of families to reduce their mortgage payments DATE. Hundreds of thousands of homeowners are making reduced payments through trial modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). While these numbers are encouraging, the real success will be in the number of foreclosures actually averted through successful permanent modifications. At the Board of Governors in Washington, and at the regional Federal Reserve Banks across the country, we are providing data and bringing together different parties from the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to encourage strategies for refinance, loan modifications, short sales, and other alternatives to preventable foreclosures. The Federal Reserve System also supports local and regional initiatives to address the negative effects that large numbers of foreclosures can have on individual consumers and their surrounding communities. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago is probably one of the finest examples of such efforts. In DATE, NHS of Chicago identified predatory lending as a threat to the neighborhoods it served. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and many others including - I am proud to say - the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, NHS formed the Home Ownership Preservation Initiative (HOPI). As other communities across the country experienced similar problems, this initiative became a model for foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization efforts elsewhere. This is important, tireless work and much remains to be done. With respect to new lending, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for DATE tell the story of a fractured market for housing finance as private mortgage lending came to a standstill and new lending depended heavily on government support. The number of active mortgage companies fell NUM percent from DATE to DATE, in part because the warehouse lines of credit that mortgage companies depended on to fund their loans contracted significantly. In addition, overall demand for housing slowed appreciably. Indeed, the number of mortgage applications in DATE, NUM million, was about half the DATE level and the lowest in DATE. Such a low level of applications suggests that potential borrowers were wary of entering the housing market or feared being turned down for a loan. The DATE HMDA data also show a dramatic increase in loans made by FHA and VA, whose share of total mortgage originations were higher than at any time in the DATE history of HMDA reporting.NUM These government-backed loans have been characterized as the alternative for borrowers with a weaker credit record in the absence of a subprime market. In addition, they are presumably attractive at the moment because they are among the few affordable options for buyers with stronger credit records but only modest savings available for a down payment. In the recent past, such borrowers would have used a so-called \"piggyback\" mortgage - effectively borrowing part of the down payment - or secured private mortgage insurance to compensate for a higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. According to data from the National Association of Realtors, the typical first-time homebuyer over DATE has had a down payment of less than NUM percent of the purchase price of the home.NUM Securing even that much has historically been a barrier to home purchase, especially among lower-income, younger, or minority households.NUM Yet higher LTV loans that help overcome this barrier also pose higher credit risk. Striking the right balance in loan underwriting is critically important but has proven very difficult. The development of more flexible underwriting standards was originally hailed for the potential to help millions of families become homeowners. But at some point, a line was obviously crossed, standards were dangerously lowered, and loans were underwritten without any regard for a borrower's ability to repay. When home prices fell and jobs were lost, borrowers who did not have other assets to tap were left exposed. So the question is: How can the market re-emerge with enough flexibility to allow more families to achieve homeownership in a responsible way, while avoiding the mistakes of the recent past? Achieving credit quality and availability Some would argue that most of the really risky behavior is now out of the market. But, unfortunately, the backlash has restricted a lot of perfectly responsible lending as well. Banks are reluctant to put any but the lowest possible risk loans in their portfolios. And the market for new private mortgage loan securitizations is essentially closed. Thus, borrowers face tight underwriting requirements, even if their own risk profile looks relatively \"safe\" by historical standards. Moreover, even homebuyers with the requisite down payment realize that their home equity is much less liquid than in the past. Once, borrowers could count on cash-out refinancing or home equity lines of credit as a means of cheaply accessing their home equity; these avenues are now much more restricted. A risk-averse renter might prefer to keep his assets readily available rather than lock them up in a house. On balance, even taking into account the excesses of the bubble period, it appears that lenders have now tightened underwriting terms so much that the lack of credit availability is at least partially an impediment to homeownership. As we work to correct the problems of the recent past, we must keep in mind the importance of access to credit. If anything, the recent mortgage meltdown and sharp pullback in lending only demonstrates how critical it is for the economy to have a well-functioning housing finance market. With the old mortgage system in disarray, we are, one hopes, within sight of a new and stronger system. While there are many structural permutations that might characterize the new system, I would suggest we focus on four core principles for evaluating proposals: Adequate consumer protection. First and foremost, any new system must contain adequate protections for consumers. In the aftermath of widespread abuses, consumers need to feel confident that they can satisfactorily negotiate a reasonable mortgage. Transparency. Second, there must be transparency at all levels. Retail products should be as transparent as possible, so that consumers find it easy to understand the terms and risks of their mortgages. Lenders and servicers should also make as much information as is reasonably feasible available to investors. Indeed, adequate information for due diligence is likely a prerequisite to attract capital back to the mortgage market. Simplicity. Third, the new system should encourage simplicity. Retail mortgage contracts ought to be as simple as possible. Too often, the complexity of mortgages has served to confuse borrowers and make it more difficult to make informed decisions. Similarly, the complexity of the securitizations into which mortgages were packaged made analysis difficult for investors. These structures turned out to be especially fragile when stressed with high defaults and subsequent losses. After the crash, with delinquencies rising, investors found modeling the cash flows under alternative scenarios confusing and uncertain. While complexity may prove to be an inevitable byproduct of financial innovation, investors will likely demand much simpler instruments going forward. Properly aligned incentives. Finally, the new system should feature clear roles and properly aligned incentives for all players. Too often in the recent turmoil, we saw examples of misaligned interests and competing objectives. For instance, there is evidence that some loan officers and mortgage brokers may have been as concerned about whether loans were profitable to them personally as they were about whether the borrower could actually repay.NUM Servicers, too, turned out to have interests that were not always aligned with investors, and different tranches of investors themselves had competing interests that they tried to impose onto servicers. Certainly, greater clarity about roles and responsibilities, and the associated compensation of participants in the origination chain, will help all parties understand, and properly align, incentives. Homeownership yet to come Under these guiding principles, what would a new mortgage market look like? Lending practices The Federal Reserve has already taken steps to implement and enforce safeguards to shield consumers from hazards in the market. In DATE, we have created a blanket of new protections for consumers under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, adding layers of defenses for borrowers as they participate in the economy.NUM The new rules, most of which went into effect on DATE, target higher-priced loans, where borrowers are most vulnerable to abuse. Our new rules require that lenders verify borrowers' abilities to repay these \"riskier\" mortgages, ban prepayment penalties if payments may increase in the loan's DATE, require escrows for taxes and insurance, and prohibit a range of misleading advertising practices. Under Truth in Lending we also have recently proposed revised mortgage disclosure forms for all loans. These new forms were developed through consumer testing to ensure that they provide information that is useful and understandable to consumers. These disclosures are designed to focus consumer attention on mortgage features, such as variable rates, that might be appropriate for some consumers, but potentially risky for others. And we have proposed to ban compensation that gives originators incentives to steer borrowers to loans with higher rates or disadvantageous terms. We would encourage comments on these proposals; the public comment period is open until DATE Despite efforts to improve disclosures and ban egregious practices, obtaining a mortgage and purchasing a home is still a significant and complex transaction. Evidence indicates that consumer counseling, whether for pre-purchase or foreclosure prevention, leads to better outcomes for consumers.NUM This is likely to remain true even if we do a better job of providing much-needed financial education. So it would make sense to include strong incentives to obtain counseling and strong support for housing counselors in our toolkit of the future. Secondary market While these important consumer protections will help restore borrower confidence, restoration of investor confidence may not come as easily. Whether the ultimate vehicle is covered bonds, loan securitizations, or some other model, a mechanism for channeling investment funds into housing finance will be critical to meeting the demands of a normally functioning housing market. Restoration of the residential housing finance market will require more than liquidity. At a minimum, it is likely to require access to information, standardized contracts, and simplified structures. In the past, potential investors found it difficult to access loan-level data on the deals they were investing in. At best, market participants had access to underwriting and performance information only after the deal had been issued. Even then, complete information on borrower leverage - such as through \"silent seconds\" or junior liens obtained after the origination of the first - was difficult, or expensive, to come by. Some of the security structures that proliferated late in the credit boom contained features that, whatever their initial purpose have served to obfuscate the relationship between loan performance and security cash flow. Securities also differed markedly in the governing contracts, notably the pooling and servicing agreements, or PSAs. These crucial documents were hundreds of pages long, differed across deals, and the agreements themselves, despite being obsessively detailed, failed to address a scenario of rapidly mounting credit losses. Future securities will benefit from as much standardization as possible across contracts, and the contracts will have to spell out clearly how they can be amended to deal with unforeseeable circumstances. Recognizing that no contract will ever be able to specify rules for all possible contingencies, contracts should specify a governance structure for decisionmaking in extreme circumstances. Servicers Servicers have not always been the most visible part of the mortgage business. Responses to this current crisis, however, including attempts to make large-scale loan modifications, have pointed to the critical role that servicers play through their direct interaction with borrowers. Yet, there have been problems. Many servicers did not have - and some may still not have - adequate systems and personnel in place to deal with the sheer scale of the foreclosure crisis. Servicers are concerned about the competing interest of investors and the threat of litigation for pursuing alternatives to foreclosure. In turn, some investors have questioned servicers' incentives. In the future, servicer contracts will need to provide clear guidance and incentive structures that lead to transparency and certainty in loan modifications and other loss mitigation tools. Performance under such contracts will require servicers to make investments in staffing and information technology infrastructure. And finally, in the future, compensation for servicers likely will need to recognize the different resources required for loss mitigation as opposed to simple payment accounting and forwarding. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac It would be unrealistic to expect the private mortgage market to rebound without defining the ongoing role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have continued to issue large quantities of securities even as private securitization faltered, apparently because investors have continued to believe that the government stands behind them. That experience suggests that, at least under the most stressed conditions, some form of government backstop may be necessary to ensure continued securitization of mortgages. However, restarting the GSEs in their old forms would do nothing but ask for a repeat of recent history. Without getting into specific proposals DATE, I'll simply say that whatever is the ultimate future for Fannie and Freddie, market participants will need to see a clear roadmap for both the individual institutions and the role of government in housing finance before private markets can begin to map a course for themselves. Conclusion DATE I have attempted to outline a framework for a better-functioning mortgage market that protects consumers and provides transparency to lenders, investors, and all market participants. This is the housing finance market we need to create if responsible homeownership is to return as a safe and viable option for the majority of consumers. It is a market that would be attractive and profitable for lenders, servicers, and investors who are prepared to engage in prudent, responsible, and transparent business practices. Lending, when done responsibly, is good for business. Homeownership, when sustainable, is good for consumers. Leverage, when used judiciously, is critical to a functioning market. It would be hard to overestimate the damage that has been done to the housing market in DATE, and especially to the millions of families that are suffering the devastating consequences of foreclosure. It would be equally difficult to overestimate the damage that would be done in the future if we must live with a chronically impaired mortgage market. We absolutely need to change our systems so that they function properly, support the emergence of simpler, more transparent markets, ensure aligned incentives among all parties, and, above all, protect consumers. That, I would hope, is the market of Homeownership Yet to Come.",

                  "Elizabeth A Duke: Keys to successful neighborhood stabilization Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Community Stabilization Symposium, NeighborWorks Training Institute, National Harbor, Maryland, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    Good morning. I am very pleased to be here to welcome you to the NeighborWorks' Training Institute Symposium on Community Stabilization. The Federal Reserve is co-sponsoring this event as part of a partnership we have with NeighborWorks America (NeighborWorks) to reduce the impact of foreclosures in low- and moderate-income communities. Clearly, much remains to be done to stabilize communities hard-hit by the foreclosure crisis, but we are encouraged by the work of this partnership, now in DATE. We are leveraging the resources of the Federal Reserve, particularly our data resources and our network of regional Reserve Banks across the country, to assist NeighborWorks' activities with respect to training, foreclosure counseling resources, and building the capacity of local community organizations. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke asked me to chair the Board's Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs and to represent the Federal Reserve on the NeighborWorks Board. As a former community banker, I came to my new assignments with an understanding of the role that financial institutions, in partnership with local stakeholders, play in creating healthy sustainable communities. But I wanted to see first-hand how the economic crisis was impacting communities, how NeighborWorks was responding, and how the Reserve Banks were assisting communities under stress and the organizations that serve them. So, Community Affairs staff in the twelve Reserve Bank Districts and the community organizations they work with - including many NeighborWorks Organizations - arranged for me to tour several stressed communities across the country. And I must say, these visits have enriched my understanding of the vital work being done in local communities, and its importance for the nation's economic future. So I thought the best way I could kick off this conference would be to tell you a little bit about what I learned on my visits, particularly as these lessons relate to community stabilization efforts. I know that most of what I say will come as no surprise to those of you who work with these issues every day. But I want to recognize the significant work you do and express my profound appreciation, especially to those who shared their experiences with me as we toured your cities and learned about your work. Regional economic conditions matter The first lesson I learned during my travels is that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for community stabilization. The downturn in housing has affected communities in a variety of ways, depending on the underlying economics of each. Because of these variations, a stabilization strategy that is effective in an industrial city facing high unemployment is unlikely to suit a suburban community where employment has remained relatively stable. Communities with weak underlying economies are characterized by a long trend of population loss, gradual impoverishment, and strained municipal resources. For cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Indianapolis the increase in foreclosures over DATE has exacerbated a pre-existing vacancy problem.NUM The increased rates of foreclosures and the related economic downturn have hastened a cycle of decreasing property values. Declines in state and local property and sales tax revenues result in even more vacant homes and deteriorating neighborhoods. Many community organizations and homeowners have been frustrated by the difficulties of working with mortgage lenders and servicers, and these problems are even more exaggerated in weaker market cities. In the most devastated neighborhoods, some lenders do not even complete the foreclosure process or record the outcome of foreclosure sales because the cost of foreclosing exceeds the value of the property. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these \"toxic titles\" have placed significant numbers of properties in a difficult state of legal limbo.NUM As a result of the high rates of abandonment, many cities such as Flint, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, and Youngstown, Ohio have pursued plans to \"right size\" by demolishing vacant properties and creating land banks. These strategies effectively align housing supply with demand and create open spaces and parkland that promote community health and sustainability. Several community organizations in Detroit, for instance, have joined together to promote an urban farming initiative that not only reclaims abandoned properties but capitalizes on the growing popularity of locally grown food. Detroit's Garden Resource Program provides hundreds of home, school, and community gardens access to resources and information that empower residents to grow, harvest, prepare, and preserve food in their backyards and neighborhoods. In DATE, the program supplied over NUM community gardens, NUM schools, and NUM families with seeds, plants, and training that produced thousands of pounds of food inside the City of Detroit.NUM Even communities with strong underlying economies have not been immune to the destabilizing effects of high foreclosure rates. I visited California's Inland Empire and Los Angeles, as well as areas in Atlanta, that until recently were economically vibrant. Many coastal cities - even those with jobs and growing populations - now are in distress because of high rates of foreclosure. For instance, the Florida cities of Cape Coral, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Sarasota are among those with the highest rates of foreclosure - between NUM and NUM percent. These areas, and others in the West, such as Las Vegas and Phoenix, experienced very high rates of new home construction and speculative investments that resulted in unsustainable price escalation throughout the early part of this decade.NUM Vacant properties are creating a different kind of problem in some California markets. Indeed, as investors sense that home prices have bottomed out, they are approaching servicers with cash offers for the bulk purchase of properties. In fact, community organizations in areas of California complain that investor interest has heated up to the point that qualified first-time homebuyers and local community organizations are being crowded out of the market. Foreclosure rescue scams that have taken up residence in nearly every community appear to be even more prevalent in stronger market areas where retaining title to a home is more economically feasible. One counselor in Los Angeles told me that as many as NUM percent of the homeowners she counseled had been victims of rescue scams. In addition to the economic dynamics of any particular city, it is clear that, even within metropolitan areas, community stabilization issues can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. For example, Cleveland's highest vacancy rates are primarily in its urban core, while in Atlanta, the problem of high foreclosure rates is found not only in the urban core, but also in outer suburban communities that experienced significant growth recently. For cities like Atlanta, strategies addressing high foreclosure rates must take into account wide variations in local capacity across and within metropolitan areas. Newer suburbs have not, for the most part, had time to develop the community resources and technical expertise that exist in urban centers. Another lesson I learned in my travels is about the need to understand community dynamics. In the end, the success of any community stabilization plan depends on the dedication and expertise of local leaders like those of you here DATE. Cleveland's Detroit Shoreway neighborhood, for example, clearly demonstrates that with the right vision, leadership, and planning even a highly distressed community can regain its position as a dynamic and attractive neighborhood by maximizing its natural and cultural assets. Holistic approach is key Foreclosure mitigation activities, by necessity, focus on individual houses and mortgages in an attempt to resolve legal and economic issues between borrowers, servicers, and investors. Nonetheless, after visiting with community organizations and seeing their work first-hand, it is clear to me that the most effective community stabilization approaches look beyond homes and mortgages. Successful community stabilization requires a broader vision of community, one that factors in the many elements that make a neighborhood a desirable place to live. The bottom line is that housing alone is not sufficient to create sustainable and economically resilient communities. I have seen several compelling examples of this kind of multi-faceted approach to community development. Atlanta's development efforts, for example, included the creation of the Center for Working Families. The Center serves people who are seeking employment and are eager to learn new skills that will help them support their families, build wealth, or start a business. The Center also offers its clients individual coaching to help them hurdle the barriers that keep them from securing and maintaining employment by providing transportation assistance, childcare subsidies, and computer literacy training. And, unlike a traditional job training and placement program, the Center's relationship with its clients continues long after they secure employment. Nearby, in the Centennial Place neighborhood, a mixed-income, mixed-use community developed by the Atlanta Housing Authority on the site of one of the nation's first public housing complexes, I found Centennial Place Elementary School. Centennial Place is a math, science, and technology-oriented school that is breaking records as one of the top performing schools in the Atlanta school system. They have steadily improved test scores in reading and math. Students and parents alike are fully engaged in the learning process in this state-of-the-art school. In Dallas, I was introduced to Lone Star Investment Advisors, an organization that invests in low- to moderate- income areas throughout Texas. Lone Star created a private equity fund that invests in Texas companies that are located in, or willing to move to, low-income census tracts. The fund's managers have focused on manufacturing and distribution companies that are valued at $NUM million and up and can create jobs in the state's lower-income communities. Its double bottom-line approach to investments - making a profit while benefitting the community - makes it attractive to bankers with Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) obligations as well as other socially-minded investors. PrimeSource Food Service Equipment is one such business that Lone Star moved from an affluent northern Dallas suburb to South Dallas, where the poverty rate is NUM%. PrimeSource relocated over NUM employees and hired new employees from South Dallas. In Philadelphia, I toured a supermarket that provides for one of the most basic needs in many low-income neighborhoods: fresh food. The Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative is an innovative program that works to increase the number of supermarkets and groceries in underserved communities across Pennsylvania. The initiative is supported by a partnership among The Reinvestment Fund, a non-profit developer, and two community organizations, The Food Trust and the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition.NUM This partnership has stepped in to fill a financing need where infrastructure costs were not met by conventional financial institutions. In addition to improving the neighborhood's access to nutritious food, the supermarket initiative meets several other community needs, including job creation and lower food costs for those with limited incomes. It also provides a focal point for other vital retail needs in the community. Other organizations are dedicated to meeting the healthcare needs of their community. Chicago's Lawndale Christian Health Center is one such organization.NUM The center serves the Lawndale and Garfield communities on the West Side of Chicago by providing quality primary care services without regard to a patient's ability to pay, and in so doing, it works to eliminate the impact of healthcare disparities among the city's residents. The Lawndale Center is known for its holistic approach to healthcare: it offers not only primary medical care, including internal medicine, pediatrics, cardiology, optometry, and dentistry, but also services that support patients' psychological, spiritual, and social health. In DATE alone, the Center accommodated more than NUM,NUM outpatient medical visits, NUM,NUM hospital visits, NUM deliveries, NUM,NUM dental visits, and NUM,NUM optometry visits. The Center also offers programs in leadership development and organizational capacity building for the community, and it employs more than NUM people, many of whom live in the community or were attracted to the community because of the Center. But even more impressive to me is the Center's connection to the community it serves. The Center was founded in DATE when a group of Lawndale residents saw a need in their community and worked to fill it. Ownership of the Center is retained by community members, ensuring that it will continue to meet the needs in its neighborhood. As these examples illustrate, a vibrant community is made up of more than houses. Neighborhoods need the right blend of housing, retail, and community services in order to remain desirable and resilient to economic cycles. Of course, the solution is not that simple. Even a neighborhood with that perfect mix of housing, retail, and services can find itself struggling. In my travels I realized that there is one characteristic shared by the communities that have coped most successfully in the economic downturn: organizational capacity. Organizational capacity As I am sure you are aware, the relationship between organizational capacity and the success of community stabilization efforts cannot be underestimated. I have had the good fortune to observe many communities whose response to the foreclosure crisis was immediate and, ultimately, has been more effective because of the deep roots of organizations in the community and the experience they have developed over DATE. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, where Bruce Gotschall has served as Executive Director since its founding in DATE, is probably one of the finest examples of this kind of organizational capacity. In DATE, NHS of Chicago identified predatory lending as a threat to the neighborhoods it served. In collaboration with the City of Chicago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and many others, NHS formed the first Home Ownership Preservation Initiative (HOPI). This initiative became the model for foreclosure prevention and has been replicated across the country. Because of this experience, NHS was wellprepared to assist Chicagoans in the recent housing market downturn. By contrast, many communities are facing the issues of vacancy, abandonment, and decay for the first time, and these communities need help to grow the human and financial capital required to address neighborhood decline. These capacities do not appear overnight, but they can be developed. As your attendance at this Training Institute demonstrates, there is a strong appetite among community organizations for information, training, and leadership development. And I am encouraged by your dedication. As a NeighborWorks Board member, I am aware that the demand for training has grown dramatically in DATE and I am very impressed by the breadth, depth, and quality of the Training Institute's offerings. In fact, a significant part of the Federal Reserve's partnership with NeighborWorks involves funding the development of courses designed to help community leaders address stabilization challenges, particularly with respect to the acquisition and disposition of real estate. In DATE of the partnership alone, NUM training certificates were awarded in the new community stabilization coursework, with even more community development practitioners attending workshops and events designed to highlight best practices and new programs available to stabilize communities. In addition to training sessions, practitioners can access this information on StableCommunities.org, a website developed by NeighborWorks with the Federal Reserve's support. The role of the Federal Reserve The partnership between the Federal Reserve and NeighborWorks America is just one aspect of the Federal Reserve's effort to stabilize neighborhoods. Community Affairs staff across the Federal Reserve System are providing data analysis and technical assistance to state and local governments trying to address foreclosures in their communities. For example, the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta are collaborating on a series of capacity-building sessions for several communities in Appalachia to improve their ability to leverage federal Neighborhood Stabilization Funds. In addition, we are studying the Neighborhood Stabilization Program and interviewing some NUM program grantees nationwide to learn about the early successes and challenges to this effort to restore health to communities with high foreclosure rates. We continue to engage in a good deal of outreach to stay informed about the challenges facing communities as this crisis evolves. Federal Reserve staff recently attended a series of meetings organized by National People's Action (NPA). These meetings, held in nine cities chosen by NPA, were designed to gather first-hand information about the impact of foreclosures in low-income communities. In each city, Fed staff met with local leaders, toured communities hit by foreclosures, and attended public meetings. In addition to giving us information about foreclosure's impact on various communities, the public meetings have been effective in drawing local press coverage, which hopefully has heightened local attention to the issues faced by residents. The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to identify ways in which our strengths as a research institution, combined with our network of Community Affairs outreach staff, can be leveraged to help communities recover from high numbers of foreclosures and related economic impacts. Conclusion In conclusion, I want to thank you all for your commitment to your communities and for your attendance here DATE. This symposium is designed to provoke and inspire our best thinking - and action - related to neighborhood stabilization. I hope that each of you finds something in DATE's discussion that applies to the underlying economic conditions of your neighborhood, that encourages holistic solutions to the problems your community faces, and that improves your ability to meet the demands placed on you as a leader in your community.",

                  "Frederic S Mishkin: Credit card disclosures Testimony of Mr Frederic S Mishkin, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website. Madam Chair Maloney, Ranking Member Gillmor, members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve Board's DATE, proposal to revise the credit card disclosures required by current Truth in Lending Act (TILA) regulations. The Board's proposed revisions to Regulation Z, which implements TILA, also apply to other revolving credit accounts not secured by a residence. However, I will focus my remarks on credit cards, the subject of this hearing and by far the most common form of open-end accounts that are not home-secured. Many more households have obtained credit cards since the Board last reviewed TILA regulations comprehensively in DATE. In DATE, less than half of American families had at least one general purpose credit card (NUM percent in DATE), and now DATE have at least one (NUM percent in DATE). The increase was sharpest among lower-income families. From DATE to DATE, the share of families in the lowest income quintile that hold a credit card jumped from NUM percent to NUM percent. Not only are more consumers holding credit cards, consumers are using their cards more. Total charges on credit cards increased by about four times from DATE to DATE alone.NUM Growth in credit card use is explained in part by consumers switching from other forms of credit such as installment loans. Growth has also been enhanced by changes in consumer preferences related to the convenience and security of using card forms of payment rather than cash. Another substantial contributor has been the development of credit scoring and risk-based pricing, which has increased use of credit cards by consumers who traditionally lacked access because of poor or limited credit histories. As credit cards have become more commonplace, they also have become more complicated. Even a relatively simple credit card account is more complex than the fixed-payment installment loan it may have replaced. Moreover, most credit cards can no longer be described as relatively simple. Once, a card may have allowed the user to make purchases or obtain cash advances and applied a single DATE percentage rate, or APR, to each feature. Fees were limited to a fee for cash advances, an DATE fee on the account, and perhaps a fee if the consumer paid late. DATE, a card may also offer balance transfers and treat different classes of purchases and cash advances as different features, each with its own APR. These APRs adjust much more frequently to respond to changes in the market or to changes in a borrower's credit risk profile. The typical card no longer has an DATE fee, but it has many other fees tied to a variety of features, or to requirements of the credit agreement, or to a growing number of optional services. All of these developments have joined to produce the seeming paradox that credit cards are both widely used and widely criticized. The Board is keenly aware of concerns over the fairness and transparency of card marketing and account terms. There is, for example, a concern that issuers advertise low introductory rates while downplaying that these rates can increase sharply. Observers worry that the varied reasons that rates can increase, sometimes by a factor of two or three, are not made clear when the consumer applies for the card, starts to use it, or builds up a substantial balance. Further, there are concerns that issuers' methods of calculating interest, such as the ways they choose to allocate customers' payments to different balances, are confusing or not clearly disclosed. More broadly, the presence in the market of terms seemingly unfavorable to consumers appears to some to indicate that the market is not fully competitive. The Board's goals and process The goals of our proposed revisions to credit card disclosures are to aid consumer decisionmaking and improve competition. More effective disclosures make information about terms and pricing easier for consumers to obtain and understand. When that happens, individual consumers are less likely to fall into \"traps for the unwary\" and are more able to choose products that offer the best combination of features and pricing to meet their personal financial needs. Better dissemination of information about credit card terms and pricing also enhances competition among credit card issuers, which, in turn, helps generate products that consumers want. To achieve these goals, the Board's proposal seeks to ensure that consumers receive key information about the costs of credit card transactions in ways they can understand, in formats they can use, and at times when it is most helpful. To help us craft a proposal to meet these specific objectives, we considered the traditional sources: public input we received in over NUM comment letters, available sources of data and information, and our own long experience implementing TILA. We also considered what consumers, themselves, had to say. As part of extensive consumer testing, we interviewed consumers individually about their use and understanding of different disclosures. Consumers told us what information they find useful when making credit decisions and what information they ignore. We learned which words and formats for presenting information promote understanding and which do not. These lessons are reflected in a myriad of preliminary judgments we have made about appropriate disclosure content, format, and timing. The judgments required were not always clear-cut. Frankly, it is sometimes difficult to determine which transaction terms are most important because consumers use credit cards in many different ways. It is also difficult to determine how much information about those terms is enough; what information should be highlighted, and what should be disclosed less prominently; what information should be disclosed early on in the transaction, and what can be reserved for later. The Board also must balance a rule's specificity, which makes disclosures more consistent and reduces the risk of non-compliance, with its flexibility, which reduces operational burdens and ensures that disclosures can be adapted to changes in credit products and practices. In addition, the Board tried to ensure that creditor compliance and operational burdens are justified by the expected benefits to consumers and competition, and to reduce existing burdens if they are not warranted. Developing effective credit card disclosures is particularly challenging because of the complicated and dynamic nature of the product. First, explaining the effective cost of credit before the consumer uses the card is difficult because key elements affecting the cost, such as whether the consumer will pay off balances regularly or carry balances that incur finance charges, are unknown. So TILA requires disclosures that provide consumers several terms that, together, determine the effective cost of credit: the periodic rate and nominal APR, other charges such as fixed and minimum fees, the grace period, and the balance calculation method. Clearly and simply explaining what these terms mean and how collectively they determine the cost of credit is difficult. Second, effectively disclosing credit card pricing becomes more difficult as credit card pricing grows more complex with the spread of risk-based pricing and penalty pricing and the \"unbundling\" of the price of a credit card into many different types of rates and fees. Clearly explaining costs contingent on future events that might seem remote when disclosures are made and promoting awareness of the total cost - not just component costs - pose additional challenges. Third, credit card pricing and features will continue to change, which means that we must try to craft disclosure requirements that work DATE and as products change. The Board's proposal Taking all of this into account, the Board has developed a comprehensive proposal to revise Regulation Z that includes the following specific elements: Advertisements of introductory rates would more clearly disclose the eventual higher rates and how soon they would be imposed; Advertisements of \"fixed\" rates would be restricted to rates that are truly not subject to change, either for a clearly disclosed period or for the life of the plan; The \"Schumer box\" required with credit card solicitations and applications would be updated to more effectively present information about rates and fees. As can be seen in the attached model form, the most critical rate and fee information would be presented in the box; rates and fees would be separated into two sections; and graphic techniques such as minimum font size, judicious bolding, and vertical alignment of key numbers would make it easier to read and use; Summary tables similar to the Schumer box would accompany the lengthy, complex credit agreements that consumers receive both when they first open an account and would also be provided, later, when account terms are amended. A model of this new disclosure is attached; The penalty rate and penalty fees would be highlighted in the Schumer box and the accountopening summary table; and a reminder of late payment penalties would appear on every periodic statement; A consumer would be sent notice DATE before a penalty rate was imposed or the rate was increased for other reasons; The cumulative cost of fees would be highlighted DATE, as can be seen in the attached model of a periodic statement. Fees charged in the last cycle would be grouped together on the statement in a prominent location and totaled for the cycle and DATE; The periodic statement's \"effective APR,\" another way of disclosing the total cost of credit, is the subject of two alternative proposals. Under one, the effective APR could be revised to make it simpler for creditors to compute and potentially easier for consumers to understand. Under the other, if continued consumer testing, the public comments and the Board's analysis indicate that the effective APR does not have a meaningful benefit, then it could be eliminated, as the statute authorizes; Consumers would be warned on the periodic statement about the higher cost of making only minimum payments, and creditors would be provided incentives to give consumers a more precise estimate of the time to repay the balance and to place that estimate on the periodic statement rather than make it available by telephone; and Creditors would receive clearer guidance as to what charges must be disclosed, when, and how, along with increased flexibility to disclose charges at times and by methods more convenient to the creditor and consumer alike. We are committed to providing the public a meaningful opportunity to evaluate and comment on these and other elements of the proposal, most of which are detailed in Appendix I. The Board has posted to its web site a lengthy report of its consumer testing, which forms the basis for major elements of the proposal, and has explained the reasons for the proposal in some detail in over NUM pages of \"supplementary information.\" The public has DATE to submit comment letters, which the Board expects will contain many useful responses and suggestions. I want to say more about two elements of the proposal that we expect will elicit vigorous comment. The first is the proposed new notification requirement when rates are raised. With some exceptions, the current regulation requires that notice be mailed DATE before a rate increase takes effect. The Board is concerned that this notice can leave consumers too little time to react and possibly to shop for alternative sources of credit or pay off the existing credit card balance under existing terms. Further, one of the current exceptions to the DATE notice requirement is for rate increases that are penalties (for example, for exceeding the credit limit). The Board believes that consumers will not necessarily anticipate penalty-based rate increases when the penalty was disclosed in credit agreements they received DATE, or even DATE, earlier. Thus, the Board has proposed to lengthen the notice period for a rate increase to DATE and require advance notification of penaltybased rate increases as well. In practice, consumers would have the benefit of DATE to pursue their options, and creditors would forego collecting some interest revenue. The Board wants to receive comments addressing whether the costs are justified by the benefits. The two alternative proposals concerning the effective APR on the periodic statement also are expected to elicit vigorous comment. The effective APR reflects the cost of interest and certain other finance charges imposed during the statement period. As an example, a cash advance carries an effective APR that reflects both interest assessed on the balance in the billing period and any fee charged by the creditor for the cash advance. The effective APR can be quite high, often much higher than the nominal APR, in part because it amortizes the cost of credit, including fees, over DATE. Although consumer groups argue that the resulting \"sticker shock\" helps consumers make better credit shopping and account management decisions, creditors argue that it confuses consumers and misleads them to think the cost of credit is higher than it is. Consumer testing conducted for the Board suggests that many consumers have a limited understanding, if any, of the effective APR, but it also suggests that clearer presentation of the disclosure can improve understanding. Thus, the proposal seeks to present the effective APR more clearly to consumers with more straightforward terminology and better formatting that promotes understanding. In addition, the proposal seeks to improve consumer understanding and reduce creditor uncertainty by specifying more clearly than the present regulation which fees are to be included in the effective APR. However, because of inherent limitations of the calculation - such as the need to assume the repayment period - and continued concern that adequate consumer understanding may be difficult to achieve, the Board is also seeking comment on an alternative proposal to eliminate the disclosure. When evaluating these two alternatives, and any others the public comments might suggest, the Board will consider the comments as well as the results of additional consumer testing. Conclusion Madam Chair, in closing, let me emphasize the Federal Reserve's commitment to ensuring that consumers get key information about credit card terms in ways they can understand, in formats they can use, and at times when it is most helpful. We appreciate efforts in the Congress and among consumer groups and the credit card industry to ensure that disclosure practices are in line with the needs of consumers. As my testimony TIME indicates, more complex pricing and continuous change in the marketplace make the task of writing rules for effective disclosure challenging. Nevertheless, the combination of extensive review, substantial public input, and systematic consumer testing has enabled us to propose changes that we believe will further the original goals of the Truth in Lending Act to promote economic stability and competition through the informed use of credit. I look forward to our continuing efforts in this regard, and I am happy to address any questions you might have. Appendix I Summary of proposed changes to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Z The following summary is organized according to the major disclosures required under Regulation Z. For more information, see the Federal Register notice the Board approved on DATE. Advertisements Regulation Z requires that advertisements that contain certain information about the cost of a loan disclose additional information to give the consumer a fuller picture of the cost. The regulation also requires that terms advertised actually be available. Advertising discounted rates. Under a proposal that would implement a Bankruptcy Act requirement, creditors that advertise a discounted initial DATE percentage rate (APR) in connection with an application or solicitation would have to place the term \"introductory\" or \"intro\" near each mention of that rate. Close to the first mention, creditors would disclose prominently the introductory rate's duration and the higher rate that would apply afterwards. Creditors would also disclose, in the \"Schumer box,\" the conditions under which consumers could lose the discount prematurely (e.g., if the consumer pays late). Advertising \"fixed\" rates. Consumer testing indicated that many consumers believe that a rate advertised as \"fixed\" will not change and do not understand that \"fixed\" may only mean that the rate does not vary based on changes in an index or formula. Under the proposal, an advertisement may refer to a rate as \"fixed\" only if the advertisement specifies a period during which the rate cannot increase for any reason (and the agreement does not give the creditor the right to increase it during that period), or if the rate will not increase while the plan is open. Advertising minimum payments. Consumers commonly are offered the option to finance the purchase of goods or services (such as appliances or furniture) by establishing an open-end credit plan, which may or may not be accessed by a credit card. These offers often advertise DATE minimum payments associated with the purchase. Under the proposal, advertisements stating a minimum DATE payment for an open-end credit plan to finance the purchase of goods or services must state, as prominently as the minimum payment, the time it would take to pay the balance and the total amount the consumer would pay if the consumer made only minimum payments. Credit card applications and solicitations; the \"Schumer box\" Under Regulation Z, credit card issuers are required to provide information about key costs and terms with their applications and solicitations in the form of a table often referred to as the \"Schumer box.\" The table is intended to help consumers focus on the most important terms when comparing offers and deciding whether to apply for a credit card account. A model of the proposed new Schumer box is attached. Format. Consumer testing showed that the basic format of the Schumer box, the vertical presentation of information in a tabular format with headings on the left-hand side, is quite effective. Testing also suggested, however, that reorganizing the information, adding certain new information, and removing other information would make the box more effective in disclosing DATE's more complex pricing of credit cards. The proposed new Schumer box reflects these lessons. For example, consistent with testing findings, it separates the box into two parts, \"interest rates and interest charges\" and \"fees.\" In the first part, it presents each major type of APR, such as a cash advance APR and a penalty APR, in a separate row instead of grouping them under the single heading \"other APRs.\" The fee section divides fees into major categories, such as transaction fees and penalty fees; DATE these fees may appear below the box, where testing confirms consumers do not readily notice them. Cross-references between the interest and fees sections were found to help ensure that consumers understand that both types of costs can apply to the same transaction. The proposed new Schumer box also incorporates graphic techniques such as a minimum font size of ten points, judicious bolding of text, and vertical alignment of key numbers. Other changes to the content and format of the Schumer box are discussed below. Rates based on creditworthiness. A creditor may disclose at solicitation a range of APRs or several discrete APRs because it will determine a particular applicant's rate based on an evaluation of creditworthiness. The proposal would require the creditor to disclose in simple terms, tested with consumers, that the rate the applicant receives would be based on the applicant's creditworthiness. Adjustable rates. Currently, if an application or solicitation offers a variable APR, the creditor must disclose inside the Schumer box the index or formula and the margin used to determine the rate. Additional details, such as how often the rate may change, must be disclosed outside the box. Consumer testing indicated that few consumers use details such as the index and margin when shopping for a card and, moreover, that consumers may be distracted or confused by such details. Under the proposal, information about variable APRs would be reduced to a single phrase indicating the APR varies \"with the market,\" along with a reference to the type of index, such as \"Prime.\" Details about the rate's determination would continue to be disclosed to consumers at account opening. Fees. Participants in consumer testing often did not notice fees if they were disclosed outside the Schumer box, as is common DATE. The proposal requires card issuers to disclose inside the box the most common penalty fees, namely, fees for paying late, exceeding a credit limit, or making a payment that is returned. The fee disclosure must also refer the consumer to the penalty rate if, for example, paying late could also trigger the penalty rate. The most common transaction fees, such as cash advance fees and balance transfer fees, also would be disclosed inside the box. Penalty pricing. The proposal would make several improvements to the Schumer box to increase consumers' understanding of default, or penalty, pricing. Currently, credit card issuers must disclose inside the box the APR that will apply in the event of the consumer's default. However, they must disclose the actions that may trigger the penalty APR outside the box, where, according to consumer testing, this information often goes unnoticed. Under the proposal, therefore, card issuers would be required to include inside the box the specific triggers of a penalty APR - such as paying late on the account. Creditors would also disclose the rate that will apply, the balances to which the penalty rate will apply, and the circumstances under which the penalty rate will expire or, if true, the fact that the penalty rate could apply indefinitely. The proposal would require card issuers to use the term \"penalty APR\" because testing demonstrated that some consumers misinterpret the term \"default rate.\" Creditors can use the term \"default\" to refer to one late payment, but consumers sometimes understand \"default\" to imply a more serious breach, or to mean something else entirely. Payment allocation/loss of grace period. The proposal would add a new disclosure to the Schumer box about the effect on credit costs of creditors' payment allocation methods. It is common for a creditor to allocate payments first to low-rate balances such as promotional balance transfers. Consumers who make purchases at a higher rate will not be able to take advantage of any \"grace period\" on the higher-rate purchases until they pay off the entire lower-rate balance transfer, which they may not have intended to do until the promotional rate expired. Consumer testing indicated that consumers are often confused about this aspect of balance transfer offers; testing also indicated that a disclosure that is short and simple while accurate and complete is challenging to achieve. The proposal seeks to balance these objectives in a new disclosure that alerts consumers that they will pay interest on their purchases until they pay the transferred balance in full. Subprime accounts. Subprime credit cards, cards offered to consumers with low credit scores or with credit problems, sometimes have substantial fees associated with opening the account. Typically, these fees are billed to consumers on the first periodic statement, and can substantially reduce the amount of credit available to the consumer. For example, the initial fees on an account with a credit limit of $NUM may reduce the available credit to less than $NUM. Consumers have complained that they were not aware that so little credit would be available to them. To address this concern, the proposal would require a card issuer offering a low credit limit and high initial fees or security deposits (NUM percent or more of the minimum credit limit) to include in the Schumer box the amount of available credit the consumer would have after paying the fees or security deposit, assuming the consumer received the minimum credit limit. Account-opening disclosures Regulation Z requires creditors to disclose rates, charges, and related terms such as grace period and balance calculation method before the first transaction on the account. Consumers' rights and responsibilities in the case of unauthorized use or billing disputes must also be explained. Currently, Regulation Z imposes few format requirements on these disclosures and creditors typically integrate them with the cardholder agreement, which is usually dense and long. Account-opening summary table. The proposal requires creditors to include a table summarizing the most important terms in an easy-to-follow format, substantially similar to the Schumer box the consumer typically would have seen with the application. An example of this new table is attached. Fees. Under the current rules, a creditor must disclose any fee that is a \"finance charge\" or \"other charge\" in the written account-opening disclosures and generally has no obligation to disclose it again, unless the charge is increased. New fees added to the plan after account opening must be disclosed before they take effect and later if they increase. (Of course, after a fee is charged, it must appear on the periodic statement; disclosure at that stage is discussed later.) Creditors have sometimes had difficulty determining whether a particular fee is properly classified as a \"finance charge\" or \"other charge,\" or as neither of these. Although the regulation and commentary give specific guidance, sometimes new services develop before the guidance can be updated. When that happens, creditors can find it difficult to determine if the fee for the service must be disclosed in writing at account opening (or before the fee takes effect, if a service is added later). This uncertainty can pose legal risks for creditors that act in good faith to comply with the law, and it can lead to inconsistent disclosure to consumers. Moreover, it is not clear that consumers benefit from requiring creditors to disclose every potential fee in writing and at account opening. It may be DATE, and possibly DATE, until the consumer requests the service for which the fee is imposed. Furthermore, the consumer may request the service by telephone for speed and convenience, and not expect to have to wait for a written disclosure before the transaction can be completed. The proposal seeks to address these potential limitations of the present rule while taking into account the Truth in Lending Act's (TILA) requirement to disclose plan-related charges before they are imposed. Accordingly, under the proposal, the rules would be revised to2 specify precisely the charges that creditors must disclose in writing at account opening (interest, minimum charges, transaction fees, DATE fees, and penalty fees such as for paying late), which would be listed in the summary table referred to above; and (NUM) permit creditors to disclose other charges, typically fees for optional services that may be used infrequently, orally or in writing before the consumer agrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge. To prevent abuse of this flexibility, the proposal requires that an oral disclosure be clear and conspicuous, and that it be given when the consumer would likely notice it. Periodic statements Once an account has been opened, creditors are required to provide periodic statements reflecting the account activity for each billing cycle, typically DATE. The statement must identify each transaction on the account, such as a purchase or cash advance. It must also identify each \"finance charge\" (using that term) and other charges imposed as part of the plan during the cycle. And it must identify the periodic rate(s) and corresponding DATE percentage rate(s), also known as the nominal APR, that applied during the last cycle. If finance charges were imposed in the form of fees (e.g., a cash advance fee), as well as (or instead of) DATE interest, then the statement must disclose an effective total APR reflecting the finance charge, with limited exceptions. Under amendments to TILA made by the Bankruptcy Act that are implemented in this proposal, creditors must also disclose information about the cost of paying late or making only the minimum payment due. A model of the periodic statement that reflects the revisions discussed below is attached. Transactions. As the regulation currently permits, transactions are often presented in chronological order and not by transaction type. Participants in consumer testing found it easier to read and use statements where similar types of transactions are grouped together. Accordingly, the proposal requires creditors to group similar transactions together by type, such as purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers. Fee and interest charges. The proposal contains a number of revisions to the periodic statement to improve consumers' awareness and understanding of charges they have incurred in the form of fees or interest. Consumer testing indicated that consumers have difficulty understanding the term \"finance charge.\" They are more likely to conceive of their charges as \"interest,\" the charge that results from applying a rate to a balance, and \"fees,\" such as a cash advance fee or a late payment fee. Consumer testing also indicated that many consumers more easily compute the number and amount of fees when the fees are itemized and grouped together. Participants noticed fees and interest charges more readily when they were located near the transactions. Also, many participants more quickly and accurately determined the total charges for the billing cycle when a total fee amount for the cycle was disclosed, as well as the total interest. These findings led the Board to propose four changes to fee disclosures on the periodic statement. First, creditors would no longer have to label charges as \"finance charges;\" they would instead classify charges as \"fees\" or \"interest.\" Second, creditors would be required to group all charges together in a discrete place on the statement under the headings \"fees\" and \"interest charges.\" Third, these charges would appear near the transaction items. Fourth, creditors would disclose the total fees and total interest imposed for the cycle, and the totals for DATE. The effective APR. The effective APR disclosed on periodic statements reflects the cost of interest and certain other finance charges imposed during the statement period. For example, for a cash advance, the effective APR reflects both interest assessed on the balance in the statement period and any fee assessed for the advance. The effective APR can be quite high, often much higher than the nominal APR, in part because it amortizes the cost of",

                  "Ben S Bernanke: Reducing preventable mortgage foreclosures Speech of Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Independent Community Bankers of America Annual Convention, Orlando, Florida, DATE. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System's website.    Over DATE, mortgage delinquencies have increased sharply, especially among riskier loans. This development has triggered a substantial and broad-based reassessment of risk in financial markets, and it has exacerbated the contraction in the housing sector. In my remarks DATE, I will discuss the causes of the distress in the mortgage sector and then turn to the key question of what can be done in this environment to reduce preventable foreclosures. Although I am aware, as you are, that community banks originated few subprime mortgages, community bankers are keenly interested in these issues; foreclosures not only create personal and financial distress for individual homeowners but also can significantly hurt neighborhoods where foreclosures cluster. Efforts by both government and private-sector entities to reduce unnecessary foreclosures are helping, but more can, and should, be done. Community bankers are well positioned to contribute to these efforts, given the strong relationships you have built with your customers and your communities. The rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures Mortgage delinquencies began to rise in DATE after DATE at remarkably low levels. The worst payment problems have been among subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (subprime ARMs); more than one-fifth of the NUM million loans outstanding were seriously delinquent at the end of DATE.NUM Delinquency rates have also risen for other types of mortgages, reaching NUM percent for subprime fixed-rate loans and NUM percent on adjustable-rate loans securitized in alt-A pools. Lenders were on pace to have initiated roughly NUM-NUM/NUM million foreclosure proceedings DATE, up from an average of fewer than NUM million foreclosure starts in the preceding two years.NUM More than one-half of the foreclosure starts in DATE were on subprime mortgages. The recent surge in delinquencies in subprime ARMs is closely linked to the fact that many of these borrowers have little or no equity in their homes. For example, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act suggest that nearly NUM percent of higher-priced homepurchase loans in DATE involved a second mortgage (or \"piggyback\") loan. Other data show that more than NUM percent of the subprime loans in the DATE vintage had combined loan-tovalue ratios in excess of NUM percent, a considerably higher share than DATE.NUM Often, in recent mortgage vintages, small down payments were combined with other risk factors, such as a lack of documentation of sufficient income to make the required loan payments. This weak underwriting might not have produced widespread payment problems had house prices continued to rise at the rapid pace seen DATE. Rising prices provided leveraged borrowers with significant increases in home equity and, consequently, with greater financial flexibility. Instead, as you know, house prices are now falling in many parts of the country. The resulting decline in equity reduces both the ability and the financial incentive of stressed borrowers to remain in their homes. Indeed, historically, borrowers with little or no equity have been substantially more likely than others to fall behind in their payments. The large number of outstanding mortgages with negative amortization features may exacerbate this problem. Delinquencies and foreclosures likely will continue to rise for a while longer, for several reasons. First, supply-demand imbalances in many housing markets suggest that some further declines in house prices are likely, implying additional reductions in borrowers' equity. Second, many subprime borrowers are facing imminent resets of the interest rates on their mortgages. In DATE, about NUM-NUM/NUM million loans, representing more than NUM percent of the outstanding stock of subprime ARMs, are scheduled to reset. We estimate that the interest rate on a typical subprime ARM scheduled to reset in DATE will increase from just above NUM percent to about NUM-NUM/NUM percent, raising the DATE payment by more than NUM percent, to $NUM,NUM on average. Declines in short-term interest rates and initiatives involving rate freezes will reduce the impact somewhat, but interest rate resets will nevertheless impose stress on many households. In the past, subprime borrowers were often able to avoid resets by refinancing, but currently that avenue is largely closed. Borrowers are hampered not only by their lack of equity but also by the tighter credit conditions in mortgage markets. New securitizations of nonprime mortgages have virtually halted, and commercial banks have tightened their standards, especially for riskier mortgages. Indeed, the available evidence suggests that private lenders are originating few nonprime loans at any terms. This situation calls for a vigorous response. Measures to reduce preventable foreclosures could help not only stressed borrowers but also their communities and, indeed, the broader economy. At the level of the individual community, increases in foreclosed-upon and vacant properties tend to reduce house prices in the local area, affecting other homeowners and municipal tax bases. At the national level, the rise in expected foreclosures could add significantly to the inventory of vacant unsold homes - already at more than NUM million units at the end of DATE - putting further pressure on house prices and housing construction.NUM Helping distressed borrowers Policymakers and stakeholders have been working to find effective responses to the increases in delinquencies and foreclosures. Steps that have been taken include initiating programs designed to expand refinancing opportunities and efforts to facilitate and increase the pace of loan workouts. Troubled borrowers will always require individual attention, and the most immediate impacts of foreclosures are on local communities. Thus, the support of counselors, lenders, and organizations with local ties is critical. Of course, care must be taken in designing solutions. Measures that lead to a sustainable outcome are to be preferred to temporary palliatives, which may only put off foreclosure and perhaps increase its ultimate costs. Solutions should also be prudent and consistent with the safety and soundness of the lender. Concerns about fairness and the need to minimize moral hazard add to the complexity of the issue; we want to help borrowers in trouble, but we do not want borrowers who have avoided problems through responsible financial management to feel that they are being unfairly penalized. Let me turn now to some recent efforts to help distressed borrowers refinance. The FHASecure plan, which the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced DATE, offers qualified borrowers who are delinquent because of an interest rate reset the opportunity to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage. Recently, the Congress and Administration temporarily increased the maximum loan value eligible for FHA insurance, which should allow more borrowers, particularly those in communities with higher-priced homes, to qualify for this program and to be eligible for refinancing into FHA-insured loans more generally. These efforts represent a step in the right direction. Not all borrowers are eligible for this program, of course; in particular, some equity is needed to qualify. In addition, second-lien holders must settle or be willing to re-subordinate their claims for an FHA loan, which has sometimes proved difficult to negotiate. Separately, some states have created funds to offer refinancing options, but eligibility criteria tend to be tight and the take-up rates appear to be low thus far. In cases where refinancing is not possible, the next-best solution may often be some type of loss-mitigation arrangement between the lender and the distressed borrower. Indeed, the Federal Reserve and other regulators have issued guidance urging lenders and servicers to pursue such arrangements as an alternative to foreclosure when feasible and prudent.NUM For the lender or servicer, working out a loan makes economic sense if the net present value (NPV) of the payments under a loss-mitigation strategy exceeds the NPV of payments that would be received in foreclosure.NUM Loss mitigation is made more attractive by the fact that foreclosure costs are often substantial. Historically, the foreclosure process has usually taken from DATE up to DATE, depending on state law and whether the borrower files for bankruptcy. The losses to the lender include the missed mortgage payments during that period, taxes, legal and administrative fees, real estate owned (REO) sales commissions, and maintenance expenses. Additional losses arise from the reduction in value associated with repossessed properties, particularly if they are unoccupied for some period. A recent estimate based on subprime mortgages foreclosed in DATE of DATE indicated that total losses exceeded NUM percent of the principal balance, with legal, sales, and maintenance expenses alone amounting to more than NUM percent of principal. With the time period between the last mortgage payment and REO liquidation lengthening in DATE, this loss rate will likely grow even larger. Moreover, as the time to liquidation increases, the uncertainty about the losses increases as well. The low prices offered for subprime-related securities in secondary markets support the impression that the potential for recovery through foreclosure is limited. The magnitude of, and uncertainty about, expected losses in a foreclosure suggest considerable scope for negotiating a mutually beneficial outcome if the borrower wants to stay in the home. Unfortunately, even though workouts may often be the best economic alternative, mortgage securitization and the constraints faced by servicers may make such workouts less likely. For example, trusts vary in the type and scope of modifications that are explicitly permitted, and these differences raise operational compliance costs and litigation risks. Thus, servicers may not pursue workout options that are in the collective interests of investors and borrowers. Some progress has been made (for example, through clarification of accounting rules) in reducing the disincentive for servicers to undertake economically sensible workouts. However, the barriers to, and disincentives for, workouts by servicers remain serious problems that need to be part of current discussions about how to reduce preventable foreclosures. We now have more information about the recent pace of loss-mitigation activity than we did just DATE ago, thanks to surveys of servicers by the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Hope Now Alliance, and others. These surveys generally indicate that servicers substantially increased the number of loan workouts in the latter part of DATE. The Hope Now Alliance estimates that workouts of subprime mortgages rose from around NUM,NUM in the third quarter of DATE to NUM,NUM in DATE, while workouts of prime mortgages rose from NUM,NUM to NUM,NUM over DATE. The pace of workouts picked up a bit more in DATE. Despite this progress, delinquency and default rates have risen quickly, and servicers report that they are struggling to keep up with the increased volumes. Of course, not all delinquent subprime loans can be successfully worked out; for example, borrowers who purchased homes as speculative investments may not be interested in retaining the home, and some borrowers may not be able to sustain even a reduced stream of payments. Nevertheless, scope remains to prevent unnecessary foreclosures. Lenders and servicers historically have relied on repayment plans as their preferred lossmitigation technique. Under these plans, borrowers typically repay the mortgage arrears over DATE in addition to making their regularly scheduled mortgage payments. These plans are most appropriate if the borrower has suffered a potentially reversible setback, such as a job loss or illness. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that even in the best-case scenarios, borrowers given repayment plans re-default at a high rate, especially when the arrears are large. Loan modifications, which involve any permanent change to the terms of the mortgage contract, may be preferred when the borrower cannot cope with the higher payments associated with a repayment plan. In such cases, the DATE payment is reduced through a lower interest rate, an extension of the maturity of the loan, or a write-down of the principal balance. The proposal by the Hope Now Alliance to freeze interest rates at the introductory rate for DATE is an example of a modification, in this case applied to a class of eligible borrowers. To date, permanent modifications that have occurred have typically involved a reduction in the interest rate, while reductions of principal balance have been quite rare. The preference by servicers for interest rate reductions could reflect familiarity with that technique, based on past episodes when most borrowers' problems could be solved that way. But the current housing difficulties differ from those in the past, largely because of the pervasiveness of negative equity positions. With low or negative equity, as I have mentioned, a stressed borrower has less ability (because there is no home equity to tap) and less financial incentive to try to remain in the home. In this environment, principal reductions that restore some equity for the homeowner may be a relatively more effective means of avoiding delinquency and foreclosure. Lenders tell us that they are reluctant to write down principal. They say that if they were to write down the principal and house prices were to fall further, they could feel pressured to write down principal again. Moreover, were house prices instead to rise subsequently, the lender would not share in the gains. In an environment of falling house prices, however, whether a reduction in the interest rate is preferable to a principal writedown is not immediately clear. Both types of modification involve a concession of payments, are susceptible to additional pressures to write down again, and result in the same payments to the lender if the mortgage pays to maturity. The fact that most mortgages terminate before maturity either by prepayment or default may favor an interest rate reduction. However, as I have noted, when the mortgage is \"under water,\" a reduction in principal may increase the expected payoff by reducing the risk of default and foreclosure. In my view, we could also reduce preventable foreclosures if investors acting in their own self interests were to permit servicers to write down the mortgage liabilities of borrowers by accepting a short payoff in appropriate circumstances. For example, servicers could accept a principal writedown by an amount at least sufficient to allow the borrower to refinance into a new loan from another source. A writedown that is sufficient to make borrowers eligible for a new loan would remove the downside risk to investors of additional writedowns or a redefault. This arrangement might include a feature that allows the original investors to share in any future appreciation, as recently suggested, for example, by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Servicers could also benefit from greater use of short payoffs, as this approach would simplify the calculation of expected losses and eliminate the future costs and risks of retaining the troubled mortgage in the pool. A potentially important step to facilitate greater use of short payoffs is the modernization of the FHA, which I have supported. Going beyond the current proposals for modernization, permitting the FHA greater latitude to set underwriting standards and risk-based premiums for mortgage refinancing - in a way that does not increase the expected cost to the taxpayer - would allow the FHA to help more troubled borrowers. A concern about such an approach is that servicers might refinance only their riskiest borrowers into the FHA program. A combination of careful underwriting, the use of risk premiums, and other measures (for example, a provision that would allow the FHA to return a mortgage that quickly re-defaults to the servicer) could help mitigate that risk. There are, no doubt, tax-related, accounting, and legal obstacles to expanding the use of principal writedowns. For example, investors in different tranches of mortgage-backed securities may not benefit equally, securitized trusts may not be permitted to acquire new equity warrants, and principal writedowns may require a different accounting treatment than interest rate reductions. But just as market participants, with the help of regulators, obtained greater clarity on the use of interest rate freezes through guidelines issued by the American Securitization Forum, industry and regulator efforts could also help clarify how this alternative type of workout might be effectively applied. Federal Reserve System efforts I would like to comment briefly on Federal Reserve System efforts to reduce preventable foreclosures and their costs on borrowers and communities. The Federal Reserve can help by leveraging three important strengths: our analytical and data resources; our national presence; and our history of working closely with lenders, community groups, and other local stakeholders. A major thrust of our efforts is sharing relevant and timely data analysis of mortgage delinquencies with community groups and policymakers to efficiently target resources to areas most in need. For example, we recently assisted NeighborWorks America in identifying regions and neighborhoods that are at risk of higher rates of foreclosure and could benefit from increased mortgage counseling capacity. On the basis of this analysis, NeighborWorks recently distributed $NUM million in newly granted funds from Congress to thirty-two state housing finance agencies, eighty-two community-based NeighborWorks organizations, and sixteen counseling intermediaries around the country. The Federal Reserve System also is supporting efforts to reach troubled borrowers and to raise awareness in communities about ways to prevent foreclosures. Since DATE, the community affairs groups across the Federal Reserve System have sponsored or cosponsored more than fifty events related to foreclosures, reaching more than NUM,NUM attendees including lenders, counselors, community development specialists, and policymakers. We are also concerned about the challenges of neighborhoods that have seen large increases in foreclosures and vacant properties and have begun to work with policymakers, lenders (including community banks) and community groups to address these problems. In particular, we have undertaken a joint effort with NeighborWorks America to help communities develop strategies for neighborhood stabilization. Conclusion Reducing the rate of preventable foreclosures would promote economic stability for households, neighborhoods, and the nation as a whole. Although lenders and servicers have scaled up their efforts and adopted a wider variety of loss-mitigation techniques, more can, and should, be done. The fact that many troubled borrowers have little or no equity suggests that greater use of principal writedowns or short payoffs, perhaps with shared appreciation features, would be in the best interest of both borrowers and lenders. This approach would be facilitated by allowing the FHA the flexibility to offer refinancing products to more borrowers. Ultimately, though, real relief for the mortgage market requires stabilization, and then recovery, in the nation's housing sector. Modernization of the FHA would be of help on this front as well. I am sure that the FHA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, given the appropriate powers by the Congress, will make every effort to expand their operations and to help improve the functioning of the market for home-purchase mortgages. For community bankers, FHA modernization and expansion would provide an important opportunity - of which I urge you to take advantage - to better serve your customers and community. The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, likewise could do a great deal to address the current problems in housing and the mortgage market. New capital-raising by the GSEs, together with congressional action to strengthen the supervision of these companies, would allow Fannie and Freddie to expand significantly the number of new mortgages that they securitize. With few alternative mortgage channels available DATE, such action would be highly beneficial to the economy. I urge the Congress and the GSEs to take the steps necessary to allow more potential homebuyers access to mortgage credit at reasonable terms.",

This book called the Lightning Thief, shows every angle of what happened to Percy (who got kicked out of hiss boarding school), Annabeth, and Grover to find Zeus's Lightning Bolt that someone stole. I would recommend this book to people who like Greek mythology and has special powers (for example Percy has a water power. He has a special ability to breathe in the water).The vocabulary in this book is easy to understand and it encourages young children to read. It shows them more about Greek mythology. For example, they meet Ares, God of war in his human form. He only has DATE to return the master bolt to Zeus before the DATE solstice ends and everyone is standing in his way. Zeus is getting ready to fight him on the beach. Can he get the master bolt to Zeus?",

As we read through Calvin's life through printed text, we begin to notice the significance of our lives and how the world can affect who you are. Calvin shows us what childhood is actually like. He makes the comic it's unwanted humor to take place inside his discoveries about his life. Hobbes leads us in to the real adult perspectives about doing the right thing, while he Hobbes is only seen as a stuffed tiger by Calvin's parents, or in other words not conscious. The parents and the other few cfharacters oin the comic show the world in their way. They have their own personal love/hate relationships with Calvin and his long-lasting mind. So in short, Calvin and Hobbes shows us the significance of life, and how it can be through the eyes of a kid totally unaware of the real world.",
